5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and they cloaked themselves {{under the cover of}} Chinese nationalism.|$|E
25|$|Jerome Hagen {{indicates}} that War Minister Anami's revised briefing was partly based on interrogating captured American pilot Marcus McDilda. Under torture, McDilda {{reported that the}} Americans had 100 atomic bombs, and that Tokyo and Kyoto {{would be the next}} atomic bomb targets. Both were lies; McDilda was not involved or briefed on the Manhattan Project and simply told the Japanese what he thought <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1989, James befriended Grant Wilson-Claridge {{when they}} were working {{alternate}} weeks as a DJ at the Bowgie pub near Newquay. Wilson-Claridge was intrigued by his sets, and when he discovered that James was playing tapes of his own music he suggested that they make records. At first, putting Aphex Twin’s recordings on vinyl {{was a way of}} making music the duo's friends wanted to hear; because of their geographic isolation they could not access the music <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> so they decided to create their own.|$|E

500|$|The show closer, [...] "Gorilla", was a [...] "perfect, {{slightly}} naughty end to an all-ages gig {{where the}} boundaries {{were given a}} nudge", with laser lights, fireballs, confetti and fireworks blasting as Mars sung on an elevated platform. Throughout the tour various setlists were used. [...] "The Lazy Song" [...] {{was one of the}} highlights of the tour as the crowd sung. It also contained a comedic interlude when Mars’ backup singer and songwriting partner, Phillip Lawrence, shouted the verse of the track [...] "OMG this is great!". At this moment, the music stopped, Mars introduced Lawrence to the fans and asked if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the same line again. [...] "Count On Me" [...] was only sung once, in Jakarta.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that there is much to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E

500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but {{there can be little}} question... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> rather than his true views.|$|E
500|$|Cheryl L. Gillespie gave Sexual Preference a mixed {{review in}} Family Relations, commending Bell et al. {{for using a}} {{sophisticated}} methodology and trying to avoid [...] "poorly designed measures and biased interpretation of data". Nevertheless, she found their methodology and interpretation of data open to question, writing that although their San Francisco Bay Area sample was arguably non-representative, they wrote as though the study was representative of the larger population, {{that they did not}} sufficiently explore the issue of bias in their subjects' self-reports, which might have been motivated by the subjects' ideology or desire to please the researchers by telling them what they thought <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> and that they relegated the fact that respondents who had been exposed to scientific information regarding homosexuality were more likely to characterize their parents in accord with psychoanalytic models of emotionally absent fathers and domineering mothers to a footnote. She also suggested that readers might find Sexual Preference boring.|$|E
500|$|The full cabinet met on 14:30 on August 9, {{and spent}} most of the day debating surrender. As the Big Six had done, the cabinet split, with neither Tōgō's {{position}} nor Anami's attracting a majority. Anami told the other cabinet ministers that, under torture, a captured American P-51 Mustang fighter pilot had told his interrogators that the United States possessed 100 atom bombs and that Tokyo and Kyoto would be bombed [...] "in the next few days". The pilot, Marcus McDilda, was lying. McDilda, who had been shot down off the coast of Japan two days after the Hiroshima bombing, knew nothing of the Manhattan Project and simply told his interrogators what he thought <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> to end the torture. The lie, which caused him to be classified as a high-priority prisoner, probably saved him from beheading. In reality, the United States would have had the third bomb ready for use around August 19, and a fourth in September 1945. The third bomb probably would have been used against Tokyo.|$|E

2500|$|While testifying at the Guantanamo {{military}} commission for alleged child soldier Omar Khadr, FBI agent Robert Fuller testified that Khadr had identified Maher Arar {{as among the}} al-Qaeda militants he met while in Afghanistan. On October 7, 2002, Fuller went to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and showed Canadian teenager Omar Khadr a black-and-white photograph of Arar obtained from the FBI office in Massachusetts, and demanded {{to know if he}} recognised him. Khadr initially stated that he did not recognise Arar. Upon cross-examination, Fuller clarified his testimony saying that at first Khadr could not identify Arar. Then after giving him a couple minutes Khadr [...] "stated he felt he had seen" [...] Maher Arar at a Kabul safehouse run by Abu Musab al-Suri or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The validity of Omar Khadr's possible sighting has been seriously questioned due to the time frame of the alleged sighting which was sometime during September or October 2001. Arar was known to be in North America during this time frame and under surveillance by the RCMP. Khadr's lawyer told Canadian media that Khadr, claiming to be under torture at Bagram Theater Internment Facility, simply told his captors whatever he thought <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Lawyers and advocates familiar with the case immediately dismissed the allegations.|$|E
