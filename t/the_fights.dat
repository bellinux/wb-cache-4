5|$|After the four-hour battle, {{the kibbutz}} fell. A {{dozen of the}} {{defenders}} escaped. Most others surrendered {{and one or two}} were executed. The Legionnaires protected the prisoners from irregulars and the next day freed the women. The toll was 39 dead on the Israeli side and 2 on the Legionnaires' side. The kibbutz was looted by the irregulars and the Legionnaires evacuated the area after <b>the</b> <b>fights.</b> In the evening the Yiftach Brigade retook the kibbutz.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} of {{the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E

50|$|Pride {{officials}} then signed Mezger {{to fight}} Kazushi Sakuraba, {{who at the}} time was considered {{to be one of the}} best pound for pound fighters in <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> took place at the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round. Mezger took <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> on two weeks notice and had a broken foot going into <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> <b>The</b> contract that Mezger signed stipulated that <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> would be one 15-minute round with no overtime. <b>The</b> other <b>fights</b> on <b>the</b> card had the same stipulation. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> mostly consisted of Mezger controlling <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> by stopping Sakuraba's takedown attempts while landing strikes from the outside. The round ended and Mezger expected <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> to go to the judges, but Pride officials wanted <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> to go to overtime. This resulted in one of the largest and most publicized controversies in MMA history.|$|R

5|$|Series co-creator Ed Boon {{designed}} Deception to be {{an unpredictable}} fighting game, and included new features such as the minigames as surprises. Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic {{as well as more}} interactive. Deception has been well received by video game reviewers, who praised <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> and the new features. The Konquest Mode, however, received criticism for poor voice acting. Several publications have called Deception the best fighting game of 2004.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{a mix of}} simulation and arcade style boxing. The storyline, which unfolds in the story mode, takes place in six linear segments that originally overlapped in the manga. The game's fights mirrored <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> from the manga series. The beginning of the game focuses on Ippo Makunouchi's rise to the Japanese Featherweight championship, and later switches to Ippo's fellow gym mates' careers.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} one of Ippo's senpai, Masaru Aoki, who has been boxing {{for a number of}} years before Ippo. He enters the Class A Tournament, but loses. Afterward, he begins his {{comeback}} and rises through the Lightweight division to win the Lightweight Championship against Katsutaka Imae. Aoki's story differs from the manga in that Aoki lost several of <b>the</b> <b>fights,</b> and achieved a draw in the Title bout. After Aoki's story arc, the game shifts again to another of Ippo's senpai, Tatsuya Kimura, who began boxing with Aoki. His story is very similar to Aoki's in that he also enters the Class A Tournament and loses. Afterward, he begins his comeback that eventually leads to winning the Junior Lightweight Championship fight against Ryo Mashiba. Kimura's story is also different than the manga in that he lost several of <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> and did not become the Junior Lightweight Champion.|$|E
50|$|Taylor was {{expected}} to fight Elvis Mutapcic in the opening round at WSOF 5. The New Jersey Athletic Commission cancelled <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> after seeing Mutapcic take an unknown and unapproved medication backstage before <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> was rescheduled for WSOF 7. Taylor won <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> via unanimous decision.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of media scored <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> {{in favour of}} Pacquaio. ESPN's Dan Rafael scored <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> 117-111 and ESPN analyst Teddy Atlas scored it 116-111, both for Pacquiao. CBS Sports scored <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> 114-114 even. Boxing Scene had it 116-112 for Pacquiao. BoxNation's Steve Bunce scored <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> 115-113 Horn.|$|R
25|$|On January 30, 2000, at the Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round, Guy Mezger, one of Shamrock's fighters, fought Kazushi Sakuraba, who at {{the time}} was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best pound for pound fighters in the world. Mezger took <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> on two weeks notice and had a broken foot going into <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> <b>The</b> contract that Mezger signed stipulated that <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> would be one 15 minute round with no overtime. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> mostly consisted of Mezger controlling <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> by stopping Sakuraba's takedown attempts while landing strikes from the outside.

5|$|As with film, {{the rivalry}} between the clubs' {{hooligan}} firms has been covered in {{books such as}} Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, leader of the Inter City Firm. No One Likes Us, We Don't Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain's Most Notorious Football Hooligans by Andrew Woods focuses on <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> between the two firms, {{from the perspective of}} Millwall's Bushwackers. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> between Troilus and Diomedes {{from the}} {{traditional}} narrative of Benoît and Guido take place {{the next day in}} Shakespeare's retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus' horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, as it began, in medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E
5|$|Many reviews {{commented on}} the {{graphics}}, citing there were other games with better graphics at the time. GamePro rated the graphics at 3.5 out of 5. Though the graphics were not well received, the character animations were very well received. The lack of audio dialog, which forced the player to read text for the story mode, was also a negative when many other games on the PS2 {{at the time were}} adding in voice overs. GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5. Other reviews rated the audio better, particularly the music and sound effects during <b>the</b> <b>fights.</b>|$|E
50|$|Corassani {{was chosen}} to fight Team Mayhem fighter, Dennis Bermudez, in the semi-final round. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> would {{determine}} who would move into {{the final round of}} the featherweight tournament. Though Corassani controlled throughout <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> with effective striking, scoring several knockdowns, Corassani lost <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> via submission (guillotine choke) in the first round. When the referee stopped <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> Akira had lost consciousness and had to be told that he lost <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|R
50|$|Akano faced Cris Cyborg at Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Diaz on April 11, 2009. Cyborg came in six pounds {{overweight}} for <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> Akano originally rejected <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> due to Cyborg failing to make weight but later accepted <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> She lost <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> by TKO due to strikes {{in the third}} round.|$|R
50|$|Several major figures {{received}} {{criticism for}} their actions surrounding this fight. NYSAC chairwoman Melvina Lathan was in attendance when <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> was announced, potentially indicating that the NYSAC supported <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> In addition, Bob Arum and Top Rank did not give an indication that <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> may not occur at Madison Square Garden when promoting <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> causing fans to nearly sellout Madison Square Garden with 2 weeks remaining before <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> as well as spend money on flights, hotels, etc. Plus, there was criticism that the license issue {{was not to be}} resolved until 2 weeks before <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session was lost in <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With {{nearly all of the}} governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E
5|$|Serious {{damage is}} rare, as <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> are usually short in duration, with the loser {{running away with}} little more than a few {{scratches}} to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus. Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fight</b> itself, {{which was}} fought under special rules, {{is seen as}} a {{precursor}} to modern mixed martial arts. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> saw Inoki on his back kicking Ali's legs. The result of <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> a draw, has long been debated by the press and fans. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> was refereed by Gene LeBell.|$|R
50|$|As Parker had {{exclusive}} {{relationships with}} the broadcaster of Sky {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>the</b> telecast of <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> was aired on Sky Arena in New Zealand. <b>The</b> <b>fight</b> was televised through a pay-per-view (PPV) produced by Sky and Duco Events.

5|$|The North Korean troops {{suffered}} {{heavily in}} the fight, and most became casualties in the attack. By mid-September, the NK 7th Division was reduced to just 4,000 men, a loss of 6,000 from when it was committed to the perimeter. Only 2,000 from the NK 6th Division returned to North Korea, a loss of 80 percent of its strength. Large groups of troops from the divisions were captured as they attempted to return to North Korea, including up to 3,000 North Korean troops. The attacking force of over 20,000 {{had been reduced to}} only 6,000 by the end of <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> at Masan.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: in one of <b>the</b> <b>fights,</b> Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The {{events were}} precipitated by an {{incident}} in the previous meeting between the two teams, when Ottawa's Martin Havlat had swung his stick at Mark Recchi's head. Just under two minutes {{before the end of}} the game, enforcers Donald Brashear of the Flyers and Rob Ray of the Senators engaged in a fight. As they skated off to the penalty box, Brashear became involved in another scrap, and the rest of the players on the ice for each team, including goaltenders Robert Esche and Patrick Lalime began to fight. On both of the next two face-offs to restart the game, further fights occurred. The first of these angered the Flyers management, who believed that <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> were deliberately unbalanced against their players.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> first <b>fight</b> of <b>the</b> Grand Final, Storm 2 met reigning {{champion}} and fellow rambot Tornado. Storm 2 dominated <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> and easily won the judges decision. However, the judges shouldn't have been needed for <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> Late on in <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> with Tornado running inverted, Refbot activated the pit and Tornado drove into it. Much to Team Storm's surprise, the pit raised back up again. Mentorn edited <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> to show Tornado escaping the pit just after it descended. Despite being given the questionable lifeline, Tornado lost <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{regards to}} the {{controversial}} scorecards, ESPN's Dan Rafael scored <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> 117-111 and ESPN analyst Teddy Atlas scored it 116-111, both for Pacquiao.

50|$|At UFC Fight Night: Marquardt vs. Palhares, Attonito faced debuting Brazilian Rafael Natal. Attonito won <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> via {{unanimous}} decision (29-28, 29-28, 30-27). During {{the first}} round of <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> Attonito dropped Natal with a right hook which almost prompted the referee to stop <b>the</b> <b>fight.</b> <b>The</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> was close, however the knockdown was enough for Attonito to take the decision.|$|R
5|$|The {{game has}} two modes, a single player story mode and a multi-player versus mode. The story mode follows the boxing careers {{of the main}} {{characters}} from the original series. All characters available to the player are from the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. Cut scenes are added in before and after matches as the main story telling device, and utilize the same character models as <b>the</b> <b>fights.</b> The game has six story arcs and begins with Makunouchi Ippo, the protagonist from the manga series. Story mode also unlocks more options in the versus mode as a player progresses through the story. Once a character has been played or a special technique learned, they become available in the versus mode. Likewise, once an opponent has been beaten, they are playable in the versus mode.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{to escape}} the Western themes that {{influenced}} Dr. Slump, Toriyama used Oriental scenery in Dragon Ball, referencing Chinese buildings and scenery. The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled on Bali, which he visited in 1985. The area around Bobbidi's spaceship was inspired by photos of Africa. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid the difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings. The author said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies appear very fast, and that <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> were similar to the ones in the Tenkaichi Budōkai, just not in a tournament setting.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that <b>the</b> <b>fights</b> were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fight</b> was {{originally}} placed in jeopardy due to disputes with both camps over <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> purse money. Eventually, the money issue was settled and <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> {{went on as}} scheduled. HBO aired the contest.|$|R
