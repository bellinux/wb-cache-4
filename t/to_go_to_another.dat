In February 1980, after a perilous three-day voyage across the Gulf of Thailand {{in the hands of}} paid professionals, they arrived at the Lam Sing refugee camp on the coast of Thailand. Among the thousands of refugees who were waiting for sponsorship <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> country, the Ungs waited four months in Lam Sing before they found out that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Holy Family Church in Essex Junction, Vermont, would be their sponsors. In the middle of June 1980, Loung, Meng, and Eang boarded a plane at Bangkok International Airport and headed for their new home.|$|E
500|$|While the barnstorming {{tour was}} under way, Ruppert began {{negotiating}} with Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. The Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing {{fourth in the}} National League in both 1933 and 1934, but the team drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at Braves Field, Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated {{that he would not}} release Ruth <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper Bill McKechnie. In a long letter to Ruth {{a few days before the}} press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal [...] "the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had".|$|E

[...] In a Fox Sports Southwest interview, Rick Gosselin of The Dallas Morning News also called Romo [...] "not wired to win the last game of the season" [...] especially [...] "f it means extending the season." [...] Dan Graziano of ESPNDallas.com wrote that Romo's [...] "record starts to become very hard to defend" [...] due to [...] "the oft-cited fact that he's got just the one playoff win in his entire career." ...|$|E

[...] Lee Remmel, {{who worked for}} the Packers in public relations and served as a team historian, described Mann as [...] "on the small side" [...] (5 feet 11inches, 175 pounds), but a [...] "nifty and productive wide receiver." [...] Green Bay Gazette sports writer Art Daley recalled a story involving Mann and teammate Dick Afflis, who later became known in professional wrestling as [...] "Dick the Bruiser." [...] The Packers stayed at a Baltimore hotel that would not allow Mann to stay with the team on account of a policy against allowing African-American guests. [...] When Mann left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> hotel, the 252-pound Afflis left with him. [...] When a cab driver told Afflis that he would not drive Mann because of his race, Afflis grabbed the driver by the shirt and said, [...] "You will take him wherever he wants to go." [...] Daley also recalled how he had protested the hotel not accepting Mann and Mann calmed him down by saying with a shrug, [...] "That's just politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{secondary}} education, Dominic had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> {{school and}} {{it was decided that}} he would go to the County School at Castelnuovo, three miles (5km) from his home.

He was four years the senior of John Bosco, and was Bosco's mentor and advisor.) [...] Now ten years old, Dominic walked daily to and from school. In his biography of Dominic Savio, John Bosco records how a local farmer once asked Dominic, on a hot sunny day, if he was not tired from walking, and received the reply: [...] "Nothing seems tiresome or painful when you are working for a master who pays well." [...] Don Bosco also notes that Dominic refused to go swimming with his friends since Dominic considered that in such a situation, it would be [...] "also easy to offend God", he believed that on a previous occasion his friends behaved in, what was to him, a vulgar manner. In his biography Bosco records that Fr. Allora, the head of this school, {{had this to say about}} Dominic: [...] "...Hence it may very well be said that he was Savio (wise), not only in name, but in fact, viz., in his studies, in piety, in conversation and his dealing with others, and in all his actions. ..." ...|$|E
