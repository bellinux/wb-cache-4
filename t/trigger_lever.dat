The ratchet mechanism is usually a ratchet wheel on the spool which engages with a spring-loaded pawl which can either be held open by a <b>trigger</b> <b>lever,</b> or clipped open by a knob or lever on the handle. The ratchet allows the spool to be manually rotated to wind in line when engaged.|$|E
5000|$|Archers using {{compound}} bows {{most commonly}} use a release aid {{to hold the}} string and release it precisely, although finger tabs are also popular with compound bows, especially among older archers who have used finger tabs when shooting recurve bows. The release aid attaches to the bowstring just below the nocking point or at the D loop and permits the archer to release the string {{by the use of}} some form of trigger. When such a device was first invented (patent filed in USA, 1879) it was known as a [...] "clutch". The trigger may be an actual <b>trigger</b> <b>lever</b> which is depressed by a finger or thumb (positive), or held and then released (negative); there are numerous types. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have [...] "back tension" [...] triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or [...] "true back tension"; the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached.|$|E

50|$|The center-hammer {{percussion}} models bear {{a striking}} resemblance to the larger lipfire revolvers. All were single action. Ethan Allen showed much evidence of being astute and frugal, and the design likely evolved as a way to share between a percussion series and the new lipfire weapons. Why would Allen make percussion arms at all when the more advanced cartridge revolvers were available? The oft-referenced patent lawsuit may have caused Allen to 'hedge his bets' in case he lost, and would have to cease production of cartridge revolvers (as happened in 1863). It may be that cartridge firearms were a new and uncertain technology. A conservative market, as epitomized by the US Army Ordnance Department, were buying the established technology percussion weapons by the thousand. Even Smith and Wesson failed to obtain a government contract during the war for their cartridge revolvers. In any event, the center-hammer percussion revolvers were likely seen as a replacement for the side-hammer and possibly bar-hammer revolvers in production. As with many Allen arms, the start date of manufacture is uncertain. With patent dates including 1857, 1858, 1860, and 1861, many have posed that this revolver was not made until after the settlement of the patent lawsuit in 1863. However, records indicate that the US Ordnance Department purchase about 200 from a Boston merchant in December 1861. Perhaps 1860 or early 1861 is accurate. Advertised and marketed to the military, the center-hammer was designed to be stronger and more rugged than the side-hammer revolver. In addition to the stronger frame, the cylinder pin access was moved {{to the front of the}} cylinder. The center-hammer revolvers retained the innovative combination <b>trigger</b> guard/loading <b>lever</b> of the side-hammer models.|$|R
2500|$|Glock pistols are {{designed}} with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated [...] "Safe Action" [...] by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety. The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the <b>trigger.</b> Pressing the <b>lever</b> activates the <b>trigger</b> bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure {{is applied to the}} trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released. This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off levers, hammers, or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs. The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments.|$|R
40|$|The supramammillary nucleus (SUM), a dorsal {{layer of}} the mammillary body, has {{recently}} been implicated in positive reinforcement. The present study examined whether GABAA receptors in the SUM or adjacent regions are involved in primary reinforcement using intracranial self-administration procedures. Rats learned quickly to lever-press for infusions of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin into the SUM. Although picrotoxin was also self-administered into the posterior hypothalamic nuclei and anterior ventral tegmental area, these regions were less responsive to lower doses of picrotoxin than the SUM. The finding that rats learned to respond selectively on the <b>lever</b> <b>triggering</b> drug infusions is consistent with picrotoxin’s reinforcing effect. Coadministration of the GABAA agonist muscimol disrupted picrotoxin self-administration, and another GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, was also self-administered into the SUM; thus, the reinforcing effect of picrotoxin is mediated by GABAA receptors. Since rats did not self-administer the GABAB antagonist 2 -hydroxysaclofen into the SUM, the role of GABAB receptors may be distinct from that of GABAA receptors. Pretreatment with the dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0. 05 mg/kg, i. p.) extinguished picrotoxin self-administration into the SUM, suggesting that the reinforcing effects of GABAA receptor blockade depend on normal dopamine transmission. In conclusion, the blockade of GABAA receptors in the SUM is reinforcing, and the brain ‘reward’ circuitry appears to be tonically inhibited via supramammillary GABAA receptors and more extensive than the mesolimbic dopamine system...|$|R

40|$|Many device designs include shaped lever {{mechanisms}} that must function reliably {{through a variety}} of load conditions. A lever shape is often optimized to carry out their function with optimal use of the material and processes involved in their fabrication. Levers are present in all types of devices, commonly in computer hard drives, car engines, airplane control mechanisms, medical instruments, et cetera. The design discussed in this paper is a hypothetical yet realistic one. The purpose of this work is to serve as a demonstration and training device for Engineers interested in learning how to create an adequate model and carry out complex calculations involving large displacements and contact between rigid surfaces and a three-dimensional representation of the deformable bodies of two levers and other parts of a mechanism. The model will be available to any interested party {{in the form of an}} MSC/PATRAN database (1) with the MSC/ADVANCED FEA preference [2] in the World Wide Web. The paper focuses on one aspect of the more general analysis required for a complete design, namely the calculation of stress and strain distributions, particularly in areas of contact and impact, nonelastic deformations, velocities, and driving and reaction forces under transient conditions. Problems of convergence often faced when doing a nonlinear analysis of this type are also discussed. The design –better understood by looking into figures in the paper- includes four distinctive pieces, designated as hammer, trigger, anvil, and band. Both the hammer and <b>trigger</b> are <b>levers</b> pivoting about fulcrum pins extruded from the anvil. Likewise the hammer and trigger have each an extruded pin to which the band is tightly attached pulling the two pieces together. The disposition is such that when the trigger is actuated, the hyperelastic band first accumulates strain energy and the hammer remains in place, and then the band suddenly transfers the stored strain energy to the hammer, which is accelerated and then impacts a protrusion of the anvil. The hammer carries a seal, which impacts a stamp lying on the anvil. The stamp undergoes plastic deformation as a result of the impact. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance a {{framework}} for the exploration of system transformation that includes leadership roles, contextual mess and triggering events, designing and managing sustainable learning mechanisms, managing a variety of balancing acts, creating shared understanding and, transforming shared understanding into action. Design/methodology/approach – A five-phased longitudinal research of one organization – Kibbutz Shefayim– during 12 years: semi-structured interviews (60 - 120 minutes each) with Kibbutz members representing a wide range of views and experiences in 1993; collecting and reviewing of Kibbutz internal “raw” documents that related to changes that occurred during the past 12 years, and; follow-up semi structured interviews in 1998, 2001 and 2005. The interviewed members were asked to describe the nature of the changes that had taken place since the previous interview, including reasons, mechanisms, results and impacts. Findings – The findings suggest that leading system change requires managerial orientation that is centered on balancing acts embedded in on going dialogue and the design of learning mechanisms. The paper advances a specific set of balancing acts and discusses their implications for leading system wide transformation. Research limitations/limitations – This research was conducted within one organization. Further longitudinal replications in other Kibbutz-based systems are under way. Practical implications – The proposed view of leadership as a balancing act seems to capture the experience of many managers in the twenty-first century. The findings suggest that some of the critical success factors for system-wide transformation centers on the leaders’ ability to sustain the following activities: continuous effort at bringing the outside forces into alignment with the internal forces; utilizing <b>triggering</b> events as <b>levers</b> for continuous change, and the purposeful design and management of learning mechanisms. Originality/value – Adds to the literature on the exploration of system transformation and includes leadership roles, contextual mess and triggering events, designing and managing sustainable learning mechanisms, managing a variety of balancing acts, creating shared understanding and, transforming shared understanding into action...|$|R
