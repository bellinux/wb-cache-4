2500|$|Barley {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in beer and whisky production. <b>Two-row</b> <b>barley</b> is traditionally used in German and English beers. Six-row barley was traditionally used in US beers, but both varieties are in common usage now. Distilled from green beer, whiskey has been made primarily from barley in Ireland and Scotland, while other countries have used more diverse sources of alcohol, such as the more common corn, rye and wheat in the USA. In the US, a grain type may be identified on a whisky label if that type of grain constitutes 51% {{or more of the}} ingredients and certain other conditions are satisfied. [...] About 25% of the United States' production of barley is used for malting, for which barley is the best-suited grain.|$|E
2500|$|Portland has {{the most}} total breweries and {{independent}} microbreweries of any city in the world, with 58 active breweries within city limits and 70+ within the surrounding metro area. The city receives frequent acclaim as the best beer city in the United States and is consistently ranked {{as one of the}} top-five beer destinations in the world. Portland has played a prominent role in the microbrewery revolution in the U.S. and is nicknamed [...] "Beertown" [...] and [...] "Beervana" [...] as a result. Portland's modern microbrewery boom dates to the 1980s, when Oregon state law was changed to allow the consumption of beer on brewery premises. Brewery innovation is further supported by the abundance of beer ingredients produced locally, including <b>two-row</b> <b>barley,</b> over a dozen varieties of local Cascade hops, and pure mountain water from the Bull Run Watershed.|$|E

40|$|Rph 20 is {{the only}} reported, simply {{inherited}} gene conferring moderate {{to high levels of}} adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia hordei Otth) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Key parental genotypes were examined to determine the origin of Rph 20 in <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley.</b> The Dutch cultivar 'Vada' (released in the 1950 s) and parents, 'Hordeum laevigatum' and 'Gull' ('Gold'), along with the related cultivar 'Emir' (a derivative of 'Delta'), were assessed for APR to P. hordei in a disease screening nursery. The marker bPb- 0837 -PCR, co-located with Rph 20 on the short arm of chromosome 5 H (5 HS), was used to screen genotypes for the resistance allele, Rph 20. ai. Results from phenotypic assessment and DNA analysis confirmed that Rph 20 originated from the landrace 'H. laevigatum' (i. e., Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare). Tracing back this gene through the pedigrees of <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley</b> cultivars, indicated that Rph 20 has contributed APR to P. hordei for more than 60 years.

40|$|Increased seed {{production}} {{has been a}} common goal during the domestication of cereal crops, and early cultivators of barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) selected a phenotype with a six-rowed spike that stably produced three times the usual grain number. This improved yield established barley as a founder crop for the Near Eastern Neolithic civilization. The barley spike has one central and two lateral spikelets at each rachis node. The wild-type progenitor (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) has a two-rowed phenotype, with additional, strictly rudimentary, lateral rows; this natural adaptation is advantageous for seed dispersal after shattering. Until recently, {{the origin of the}} six-rowed phenotype remained unknown. In the present study, we isolated vrs 1 (six-rowed spike 1), the gene responsible for the six-rowed spike in barley, by means of positional cloning. The wild-type Vrs 1 allele (for <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley)</b> encodes a transcription factor that includes a homeodomain with a closely linked leucine zipper motif. Expression of Vrs 1 was strictly localized in the lateral-spikelet primordia of immature spikes, suggesting that the VRS 1 protein suppresses development of the lateral rows. Loss of function of Vrs 1 resulted in complete conversion of the rudimentary lateral spikelets in <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley</b> into fully developed fertile spikelets in the six-rowed phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the six-rowed phenotype originated repeatedly, at different times and in different regions, through independent mutations of Vrs 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHulled barley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} recovered cereals in European archaeological sites from Roman and medieval periods. In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (H.  vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley</b> is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of <b>two-rowed</b> <b>barley</b> in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1 st to the 11 th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period...|$|R
