5|$|Riccò {{announced}} {{his intention to}} never race again in March, but signed with Continental team Meridiana-Kamen in June {{in the hope of}} competing in the Tour de Serbie. This did not <b>transpire,</b> as he was suspended by the Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the race, in relation to the February blood transfusion. He eventually received a twelve-year ban from the Italian National Anti-Doping Tribunal in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage {{was coming to an}} end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not <b>transpire.</b> His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{transferring}} credits {{can be divided}} into four main parts: what <b>transpires</b> prior to a college transfer, what <b>transpires</b> during college transfer, what <b>transpires</b> after college transfer and what proactive efforts are managed to help define academic pathways and agreements between institutions to streamline college transfer.|$|R
50|$|Higher {{temperatures}} are also possible with <b>transpired</b> collectors {{which can be}} configured to heat the air twice to increase the temperature rise making it suitable for space heating of larger buildings. In a 2-stage system, the first stage is the typical unglazed <b>transpired</b> collector and the second stage has glazing covering the <b>transpired</b> collector. The glazing allows all of that heated air from the first stage to be directed through {{a second set of}} <b>transpired</b> collectors for a second stage of solar heating.|$|R

5|$|The eighth {{event in}} the Bound for Glory {{chronology}} was first announced on June 10, 2012 at the Slammiversary PPV to around the weekend where Sting would be formally inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. Late June, TNA President Dixie Carter stated via Twitter that Bound for Glory would {{take place in a}} city not yet visited by the company and be revealed during the telecast of the July 5 edition of Impact Wrestling. During the show, an official video announcement confirmed the event would <b>transpire</b> at the Grand Canyon University Arena in Phoenix, Arizona on October 14, 2012. Before the tickets went on sale on July 27, 2012, Rob Van Dam promoted the event and signed autographs during a pre-sale session at the GCU Arena Box Office the day prior.|$|E
5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to <b>transpire</b> and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can {{be left in the}} ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E
5|$|The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was {{a highway}} {{bridge over the}} Delaware River in the {{community}} of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route6 in 1927 and U.S. Route46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount {{was a far cry from}} the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this <b>transpire,</b> the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{innovation}} {{has been}} the use of <b>transpired</b> collectors {{in place of the}} traditional glazing covers. <b>Transpired</b> collectors have efficiencies in the 60% to 80% range or three times the 25% efficiency measured with the greenhouse collectors. The large solar collector field can now be reduced to half or less making solar updraft towers much more cost effective. A patent has been granted on a solar tower system using <b>transpired</b> collectors.|$|R

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories {{is working}} with GenCorp, Aerojet and Foster Wheeler Development Corporation to develop a <b>transpiring</b> wall {{supercritical}} water oxidation reactor. The <b>transpiring</b> wall reactor promises to mitigate problems of salt deposition and corrosion by forming a protective boundary layer of pure supercritical water. A laboratory scale test reactor has been assembled to demonstrate the concept. A 1 / 4 scale <b>transpiring</b> wall reactor was designed and fabricated by Aerojet using their platelet technology. Sandia`s Engineering Evaluation Reactor serves as a test bed to supply, pressurize and heat the waste; collect, measure and analyze the effluent; and control operation of the system. This report describes the design, test capabilities, and operation of this versatile and unique test system with the <b>transpiring</b> wall reactor...|$|R
5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that <b>transpire</b> outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of Plasmodium ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, {{planning}} {{was underway}} for Operation Oboe Two, an amphibious assault to capture Balikpapan, a seaport on Borneo. The 9th Division was originally designated for the operation, but in April {{it was decided}} to utilise the 7th Division instead, and it duly embarked from Cairns to Morotai, the staging post for the assault. Operation Oboe Two would <b>transpire</b> to be the largest amphibious operation mounted by the Australian military. Despite opposition from the American naval commanders providing support for the operation, Milford decided to land his forces at Klandasan, a southern suburb of Balikpapan which although heavily defended, had suitable beaches for landing troops. By landing at Klandasan, Milford hoped to achieve tactical surprise and anticipated fire support from the United States Navy would help counter the coastal defences of the Japanese. The battle of Balikpapan began on 1 July with a naval barrage of the landing area, supported by bombers of the Royal Australian Air Force, with the division landing relatively unopposed by mid morning. By 1pm, the beachhead was secure and Milford, together with Generals Douglas MacArthur and Leslie Morshead made an inspection of the area. At this late stage of the war {{it was clear that the}} war would soon end, and extensive use was made of divisional artillery (which Milford had raised during his earlier spell with the division in 1940) rather than needlessly risk soldiers' lives. By 21 July, Balikpapan was secure and the Japanese were retreating into Borneo. Milford ordered a halt to further offensive action and instructed his outlying forces to hold their position, thus concluding a successful operation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn 2014, Turkey {{consumed}} 12 billion {{cubic meters}} of natural gas for space heating which accounts 26 percent of general natural gas consumption. Using several technologies to collect solar heat {{is one of the}} solutions to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. Among these technologies are <b>transpired</b> solar collectors, which are relatively new solar energy technology in Turkish energy market despite its wide and effective use in North America and Europe over the past 30 years to save energy in buildings by heating ventilation air using solar energy. In 2012, the first <b>transpired</b> solar collector on an industrial building was installed in Turkey, Cayirova. The installation on the south facing wall of PIMSA manufacturing building is a total of 770 m 2 with six large associated air handling units. This paper presents a review of the performance of the first <b>transpired</b> solar collector in Turkey. The energy drawn from solar collector and delivered to the building each month over the period of two years is monitored and analyzed. Results cover monitoring for the period of February 2013 - April 2013 and January 2014 - March 2014, when the <b>transpired</b> solar collector was operating. The monitoring system includes twenty-four thermocouples embedded in <b>transpired</b> solar collector with connected air handling units, two in the building, two outside on the wall and twenty-four automatic damper controllers all connected to a building management system. It has shown that <b>transpired</b> solar collector provides a significant amount of the heating required by the building. Heat outputs from <b>transpired</b> solar collector installation are also compared with the simulation outcomes of Retscreen solar air heating analysis software developed by the Canadian government...|$|R
25|$|Unglazed <b>transpired</b> {{collectors}} are perforated sun-facing walls {{used for}} preheating ventilation air. <b>Transpired</b> collectors {{can also be}} roof mounted for year-round use and can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22°C and deliver outlet temperatures of 45-60°C. The short payback period of <b>transpired</b> collectors (3 to 12years) make them a more cost-effective alternative to glazed collection systems. As of 2015, over 4000 systems with a combined collector area of 500,000 m2 had been installed worldwide. Representatives include an 860 m2 collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1300 m2 collector in Coimbatore, India used for drying marigolds.|$|R
