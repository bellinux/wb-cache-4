5|$|Non-fatal {{violence}} against women has severe implications for women’s physical, mental and reproductive health, and is seen as not simply isolated events but rather a systematic pattern of behaviour that both violates their rights but also limits <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> society and requires a systematic approach.|$|E

40|$|Principals were {{struggling}} with the interpretation of <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> {{the implementation of the}} NCS in South African schools, parlty due to the huge change and complexity of the NCS. It was found that principals did not understand <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> the implementation of the NCS, and as a result did not develop staff, were not familiar with the roles of educators as specified by policy and shifted the burden of developing educators to the Department of Education. A qualitative research approach was employed. A reputational case sampling was conducted on three secondary school principals in the KZN Vryheid District. A semi structured interview and a semi-structured questionaire were employed on these three principals to gather data. Theme analysis was used to determine how principals interpreted <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> the implementation of the NCS. I found that principals did not have enough understanding of <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> the implementation of the NCS. However, principals complained that the Department of Education was more concerned about expanding access to education than quality of education. They also lamented that teachers had a low self- esteem with the profession. I found that principals required detailed workshops on <b>their</b> <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> the implementation of the NCS, ongoing curriculum leadership training, and required LTSM resources and equipped laboratorie...|$|R

Protests continued into the evening, with demonstrators demanding the release of the detained protesters, most of whom were students.

5|$|The protein {{hemocyanin}} is {{the oxygen}} carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the formation of lacquers.|$|E

5|$|Throughout this period, but {{particularly}} {{in the middle of}} the 18th century, the Bastille was used by the police to suppress the trade in illegal and seditious books in France. In the 1750s, 40% of those sent to the Bastille were arrested for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing or dealing in banned material; in the 1760s, the equivalent figure was 35%. Seditious writers were also often held in the Bastille, although many of the more famous writers held in the Bastille during the period were formally imprisoned for more anti-social, rather than strictly political, offences. In particular, many of those writers detained under Louis XVI were imprisoned for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> producing illegal pornography, rather than political critiques of the regime. The writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle, the philosopher André Morellet and the historian Jean-François Marmontel, for example, were formally detained not for their more obviously political writings, but for libellous remarks or for personal insults against leading members of Parisian society.|$|E
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E

5|$|As castles {{were not}} simply {{military}} buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, {{they had a}} significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently-used road or river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim that the Jews were {{involved}} in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians. Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as comes Orientis (Count of the East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, in Antioch for <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the violence in 609.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the reform}} process, the CPV devolved some powers of the party {{secretaries}} to the district-level committees.
