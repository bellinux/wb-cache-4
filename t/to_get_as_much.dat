500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} and arranged by Shoji Meguro, whose previous {{work for the}} series included [...] and Nocturne. In contrast to his previous work on the Persona series, Meguro did not use contemporary musical elements. Instead, he created a more mature experience to reflect the game's story and setting. To achieve this, he used militaristic orchestration, Gregorian choir, and minimalistic ambiance. The choir sounds were created using Eastwest Quantum Leap Symphonic Choirs, a synthesizer which could realistically simulate a choir.

500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound". However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.|$|E

2500|$|Both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace had {{suggested}} that the evolutionary basis for how the odd relationship between the sphinx moth and A.sesquipedale evolved over time could be understood by considering one orchid with a long spur and another with a short spur. [...] If a moth goes to fertilize a flower with a short spur its proboscis would easily reach {{all the way to}} the bottom of the spur and it would get the nectar. [...] However, since the proboscis of the moth is longer than the spur of the flower, the head of the moth would not touch the flower obtaining the pollinarium and so the flower would not be fertilized. The orchid with the longer spur on the other hand would be able to be fertilized since the entire length of the proboscis fits within the spur and thus allowing the head of the moth to touch the flower and become connected to the pollinarium. [...] As a result, over time plants with longer spurs would be more likely to reproduce and so become more prevalent in the population. [...] In this way A.sesquipedale has evolved to have a very long spur. [...] The moth too would evolve to have a longer and longer proboscis in the following way. If a moth goes to fertilize an A.sesquipedale flower and the spur is longer than its proboscis then it will not be able to reach all of the nectar. As such, moths with too short of a proboscis would not be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> food as those moths with a longer proboscis who could reach all of the nectar. [...] Due to this arrangement moths with longer proboscis would become more physically fit to reproduce due to their ability to get more nectar and so such moths would become more prevalent in the population. This can result in a seesawing effect by which both organisms produce a mechanism that leads the other to increase the others spur and proboscis. There are however certain properties that no doubt prevent this mechanism from continuing indefinitely. For example, the risk such a long proboscis poses to a moth could be a factor that would prevent the spur of A.sesquipedale from becoming indefinitely long. [...] If moths with proboscises that were too cumbersomely long substantially risked their lives due to being easier prey, then such moths could only afford to evolve a proboscis to a certain length. [...] This would in turn restrict the length of the orchid's spur, since moths would not want to visit flowers whose spurs were too long since they would not be able to reach the nectar.|$|E
