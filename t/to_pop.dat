40|$|BACKGROUND: Progestin-only oral {{contraceptive}} pills (POPs) have fewer contraindications to use compared to combined pills. However, the overall prevalence of contraindications <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> among reproductive aged women {{has not been}} assessed. STUDY DESIGN: We collected information on contraindications <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> in two studies : 1) the Self-Screening Study, a sample of 1, 267 reproductive aged women {{in the general population}} in El Paso, Texas and 2) the Prospective Study of Oral Contraceptive (OC) Users, a sample of current OC users who obtained their pills in El Paso clinics (n= 532) or over the counter (OTC) in Mexican pharmacies (n= 514). In the Self-Screening Study, we also compared women’s self-assessment of contraindications using a checklist to a clinicain’s evaluation. RESULTS: Only 1. 6 % of women in the Self-Screening Study were identified as having at least one contraindication <b>to</b> <b>POPs.</b> The sensitivity of the checklist for identifying women with at least one contraindication was 75. 0 % (95 % CI: 50. 6 - 90. 4 %), and the specificity was 99. 4 % (95 % CI: 98. 8 - 99. 7 %). In total, 0. 6 % of women in the Prospective Study of OC Users reported having any contraindication <b>to</b> <b>POPs.</b> There {{were no significant differences between}} clinic and OTC users. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of contraindications <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> was very low in these samples. POPs may be the best choice for the first OTC {{oral contraceptive}} in the US.

5|$|Neo soul is a {{genre of}} popular music. The term was coined by music {{industry}} entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg {{during the late}} 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop <b>to</b> <b>pop,</b> fusion, and African music.

50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>POPs</b> are known <b>to</b> disrupt normal {{functioning of the}} endocrine system. Low level exposure <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> during critical developmental periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout its lifespan. A 2002 study synthesizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> during critical developmental stages in an organism’s lifespan. The study aimed {{to answer the question}} whether or not chronic, low level exposure <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are in utero, in ovo, and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during fetal development.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{exposure}} of people <b>to</b> <b>POPs,</b> {{it is important to}} notice that in Finland, hunting is a popular hobby among population, and over 300, 000 people had an official hunting card in 2005 allowing them to hunt according to legislation (www.mmm.fi). Hunting big game, like moose, results that a group of people might consume more moose meat than pork or poultry meat. On the other hand, reindeer husbandry (including meat production and tourism, by-products) is an important livelihood in the northern Finland and also in Russia. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> via game meat, liver, and other organs may be a problem in some specific populations [7].|$|R
5000|$|POP {{exposure}} {{may cause}} developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per IARC, possibly including breast cancer. Many POPs {{are capable of}} endocrine disruption within the reproductive system, the central nervous system, or the immune system. People and animals are exposed <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb. [...] For humans not exposed <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.|$|R
40|$|Studies on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in Antarctic {{wildlife}} are scarce, {{and usually}} {{limited to a}} single locality. As a result, wildlife exposure <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> across the Southern Ocean is poorly understood. In this study, we report the differential exposure of the major southern ocean scavengers, the giant petrels, <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> across a wide latitudinal gradient. Selected POPs (PCBs, HCB, DDTs, PBDEs) and related compounds, such as Dechlorane Plus (DP), were analyzed in plasma of southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) breeding on Livingston (62 °S 61 °W, Antarctica), Marion (46 °S 37 °E, sub-Antarctic), and Gough (40 °S 10 °W, cool temperate) islands. Northern giant petrels (Macronectes halli) from Marion Island were also studied. Stable isotope ratios of C and N (δC and δN) were used as dietary tracers of the marine habitat and trophic level, respectively. Breeding locality was a major factor explaining petrel exposure <b>to</b> <b>POPs</b> compared with species and sex. Significant relationships between δC values and POP burdens, at both inter- and intra-population levels, support latitudinal variations in feeding grounds as {{a key factor in}} explaining petrel pollutant burdens.

5|$|Mondo Cane {{consists}} of Mike Patton's arrangements and performances of 1950s and 1960s Italian pop songs. Patton had heard these songs {{while living in}} Bologna; the singer had adopted {{the city as a}} second home after marrying Italian artist Titi Zuccatosta, and had become a fluent speaker of Italian. Patton began exploring Italian popular music; although initially wishing to listen to contemporary music, he found nothing that interested him. However, he became drawn <b>to</b> <b>pop</b> music from the 1950s and 1960s, intrigued by singers using orchestras for backing rather than pop bands.
