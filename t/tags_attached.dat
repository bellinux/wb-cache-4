25|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID) uses {{electromagnetic fields}} to automatically identify and track <b>tags</b> <b>attached</b> to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy {{from a nearby}} RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line {{of sight of the}} reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).|$|E
500|$|In structure, the {{proteasome}} is a cylindrical complex {{containing a}} [...] "core" [...] of four stacked rings forming a central pore. Each ring {{is composed of}} seven individual proteins. The inner two rings are made of seven β subunits that contain three to seven protease active sites. These sites are located on the interior surface of the rings, so that the target protein must enter the central pore before it is degraded. The outer two rings each contain seven α subunits whose function is to maintain a [...] "gate" [...] through which proteins enter the barrel. These α subunits are controlled by binding to [...] "cap" [...] structures or regulatory particles that recognize polyubiquitin <b>tags</b> <b>attached</b> to protein substrates and initiate the degradation process. The overall system of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation {{is known as the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system.|$|E
60|$|When {{the three}} met, the bargain was soon struck. As each party was so desirous of making it, few {{difficulties}} were interposed. The old lady, indeed, {{was in favor}} of some delay in the transfer of the establishment, as she would like to clean and dust every shelf and corner and every article in the place. But Mr. Tolman was in a hurry to take possession; and as the son Henry would have to start off on another trip in a short time, he wanted to see his mother moved and settled before he left. There was not much to move but trunks and bandboxes, and some antiquated pieces of furniture of special value to the old lady, for Mr. Tolman insisted on buying everything in the house, just as it stood. The whole thing did not cost him, he said to himself, as much as some of his acquaintances would pay for a horse. The methodical son Henry took an account of stock, and Mr. Tolman took several lessons from the old lady, in which she explained to him how to find out the selling prices of the various articles from the marks on the little <b>tags</b> <b>attached</b> to them. And she particularly instructed him in the management of the circulating library. She informed him of the character of the books, and, as far as possible, of the character of the regular patrons. She told him whom he might trust to take out a book without paying for the one brought in, if they didn't happen to have the change with them, and she indicated with little crosses opposite their names those persons who should be required to pay cash down for what they had had, before receiving further benefits.|$|E

Talkers have the <b>tag</b> <b>attached</b> {{directly}} to the pull cord, standard bodies have the <b>tag</b> <b>attached</b> to a small chain. In the 1980s, a modified identity tag with decals to be applied was released; these decals {{vary according to the}} figure. On talker figures, the tag was tied directly to the pull-string, on standard bodies, it was suspended by a black cord around the neck. The Hasbro-authorised reproductions of the 1960s metal and 1970s identity tags are virtually indistinguishable from the original.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} major {{methods used to}} {{quantify}} the metabolome of single cells, they are: Fluorescence-Based Detection, Fluorescence Biosensors, FRET Biosensors, and Mass Spectroscopy. The first three methods listed use fluorescence microscopy to detect molecules in a cell. Usually these assays use small fluorescent <b>tags</b> <b>attached</b> to molecules of interest, however this has been shown be too invasive for single cell metabolomics, and alters {{the activity of the}} metabolites. The current solution to this problem is to use fluorescent proteins which will act as metabolite detectors, fluorescing when ever they bind to a metabolite of interest.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} the critical swimming speed of juvenile white sturgeons Acipenser transmontanus equipped with externally attached dummy ultrasonic transmitters and of untagged control {{fish in the}} laboratory.

Although transmitters were of recommended weight, we found that the swimming performance of tagged white sturgeons was significantly less than that of untagged control fish. Swimming performance of tagged fish was not differentially affected by tag location. Our results suggest that data from ultrasonic telemetry studies of externally tagged juvenile white sturgeons should be interpreted with caution due to the reduced swimming performance caused by external transmitters...|$|R
