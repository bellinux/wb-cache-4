5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

25|$|A {{pioneering}} three-color additive {{system was}} patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899. It used a rotating set of red, {{green and blue}} filters to photograph the three color components {{one after the other}} on three successive frames of panchromatic black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format nitrate film copied to black-and-white 35mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by telecine. Finally, digital image processing was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image. The result is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.|$|E
25|$|Edgar, in his madman's guise, {{meets his}} blinded {{father on the}} heath. Gloucester, not {{recognising}} him, begs Tom to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan; receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald {{that she is a}} more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> is corrupt and runs off.|$|E

He stated, [...] "I knew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> would be watching, so I wanted something in there that stated, 'This is Britney, this is why you should respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because [...] "We just needed to tell everybody she's OK".|$|E

The site's consensus reads [...] "Matthew Broderick charms in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a light and irrepressibly fun movie about being young and having fun." [...] Roger Ebert gave it {{three out of four}} stars, calling it [...] "one of the most innocent movies in a long time,” and “a sweet, warm-hearted comedy." [...] Richard Roeper called the film [...] "one of my favorite movies of all time. It {{has one of the highest}} 'repeatability' factors of any film I've ever seen ... I can watch it again and again. There's also this, and I say it in all sincerity: Ferris Bueller's Day Off is something of a suicide prevention film, or at the very least a story about a young man trying to help his friend gain some measure of self-worth ... Ferris has made it his mission to show Cameron <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> in front of him is passing him by, and that life can be pretty sweet if you wake up and embrace it. That's the lasting message of Ferris Bueller's Day Off." [...] Roeper pays homage to the film with a license plate that reads [...] "SVFRRIS". Conservative columnist George Will hailed Ferris as [...] "the moviest movie," [...] a film [...] "most true to the general spirit of the movies, the spirit of effortless escapism." ...|$|E

After he was taken to the office of Ernst vom Rath, Grynszpan fired five bullets at Vom Rath, two of which hit him in the abdomen. Vom Rath was a professional diplomat with the Foreign Office who expressed anti-Nazi sympathies, largely based on the Nazis' treatment of the Jews, and was under Gestapo investigation for being politically unreliable. Grynszpan made no attempt to escape the French police and freely confessed to the shooting. In his pocket, he carried a postcard to his parents with the message, [...] "May God forgive me ...

2500|$|The {{rebellion}} and its suppression effectively {{marked the end}} of the mamluk household al-Jazzar had raised, {{and the end of the}} mamluks as a military institution during al-Jazzar's rule. According to Philipp, the mamluk rebellion was al-Jazzar's [...] "gravest military and political crisis", with the only exception perhaps being Napoleon's siege of Acre in 1799, although the rebellion [...] "was in many ways more serious since it arose from an internal source." [...] The revolt was perceived by al-Jazzar, himself a virtual product of the mamluk system, as a betrayal of his most senior lieutenants, whose careers and wealth he created through his patronage. The rebellion thus had traumatic effects on al-Jazzar's personality, which according to Philipp, transformed al-Jazzar's [...] "latent fears, suspicions and distrust ... into a sense of paranoia". In the rebellion's aftermath, al-Jazzar launched a massive purge in his realm, executing and exiling people of all societal ranks. The 19th-century chronicler Haydar Ahmad Shihab noted that as a result of the rebellion, al-Jazzar [...] "became like an untamed animal ... he imagined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> was against him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idealist {{interpretation}} {{in which}} the beast finds expression in the socio-cultural, economic and political arena of all human activities since the existence of man best describes the scriptural perspective of the beast. This position was fully annunciated by Chike Udolisa is his book. In this perspective, {{the image of the}} four kingdoms that were to rule the world as shown to Nebuchadnezzar were equated to the four beasts revealed to Daniel, and to the seven-headed beast revealed to John. The records of [...] and [...] show this beast to represent the kings of the earth. Furthermore, the revelation in Daniel 7 of four beasts comprising a lion, bear and leopard also correlates with the seven headed beast as shown to John in [...] having the same features of the lion, bear and leopard. Thus the beast represents the kingdoms that will bear rule over the world from Adam until the second coming of Christ. While in the spirit, this beast is seen as a personality as in Revelation 19:20, in the physical he is represented at different ages throughout the period of human existence as different kingdoms. The import of this interpretation is that as the Whore of Babylon is seen to be riding this beast, the beast is the seat of operation of the whore from where she is expressed, and by whom her dominion is exercised. This corresponds to Revelation 13 where the power exercised by this beast was completely that of the dragon. This brings to light the scriptural fact that the governments of the nations are puppets in the hands of this beast, consistent with the truth <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> system is under the dragon, the god of this world.|$|E
