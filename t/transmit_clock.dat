50|$|Unlike GMII, the <b>transmit</b> <b>clock</b> {{signal is}} always {{provided}} by the MAC on the TXC line, rather than being {{provided by the}} PHY for 10/100 Mbit/s operation and by the MAC at 1000 Mbit/s. Source-synchronous clocking is used: the clock signal that is output (by either the PHY or the MAC) is synchronous with the data signals. This requires the PCB to be designed to add a 1.5-2 ns delay to the clock signal to meet the setup and hold times on the sink. RGMII v2.0 specifies an optional internal delay, obviating {{the need for the}} PCB designer to add delay; this is known as RGMII-ID.|$|E

Here design tradeoffs in each portion of the modulator and demodulator subsystem are outlined, and viable circuit approaches which are easily repeatable, have low implementation losses and have low production costs are identified. The research involved for this study was divided into nine technical papers, each addressing a significant region of concern in a variable rate modem design. Trivial portions and basic support logic designs surrounding the nine major modem blocks were omitted.

Given the clock as an evolutionarily-conserved time-keeping mechanism that synchronizes internal physiology to environmental cues, locomotor activities initiated by skeletal muscle enable entrainment to the light-dark cycles on earth, thus ensuring organismal survival and fitness.

40|$|Direct Current (DC) line {{balanced}} SpaceWire {{is attractive}} {{for a number}} of reasons. Firstly, a DC line balanced interface provides the ability to isolate the physical layer with either a transformer or capacitor to achieve higher common mode voltage rejection and or the complete galvanic isolation {{in the case of a}} transformer. And secondly, it provides the possibility to reduce the number of conductors and transceivers in the classical SpaceWire interface by half by eliminating the Strobe line. Depending on the modulator scheme the clock data recovery frequency requirements may be only twice that of the <b>transmit</b> <b>clock,</b> or even match the transmit clock: depending on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) decoder design. In this paper, several different implementation scenarios will be discussed. Two of these scenarios are backward compatible with the existing SpaceWire hardware standards except for changes at the character level. Three other scenarios, while decreasing by half the standard SpaceWire hardware components, will require changes at both the character and signal levels and work with fixed rates.

40|$|SummaryThe {{transcription}} factor Mef 2 regulates activity-dependent neuronal plasticity and morphology in mammals, and clock neurons {{are reported to}} experience activity-dependent circadian remodeling in Drosophila. We show here that Mef 2 is required for this daily fasciculation-defasciculation cycle. Moreover, the master circadian transcription complex CLK/CYC directly regulates Mef 2 transcription. ChIP-Chip analysis identified numerous Mef 2 target genes implicated in neuronal plasticity, including the cell-adhesion gene Fas 2. Genetic epistasis experiments support this transcriptional regulatory hierarchy, CLK/CYC- > Mef 2 - > Fas 2, indicate that it influences the circadian fasciculation cycle within pacemaker neurons, and suggest that this cycle also contributes to circadian behavior. Mef 2 therefore <b>transmits</b> <b>clock</b> information to machinery involved in neuronal remodeling, which contributes to locomotor activity rhythms...|$|R
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider at CERN {{promises}} {{to offer an}} exciting opportunity to study particle physics at energies of up to 14 TeV. In order to exploit {{the potential of the}} LHC, the ATLAS collaboration intends to build a complex general-purpose detector. The detector must have the ability to study known physics to a higher accuracy as well as be capable of studying as yet unknown physical phenomenon. This thesis is concerned with the development of certain key components of the ATLAS inner detector as well as the ability of the detector to study certain aspects of Supersymmetry. The ATLAS Semi-Conductor Tracker is an enormously complex sub-detector with over six million channels. A scheme using pulse height modulation to <b>transmit</b> <b>clock</b> and control information to the detector is developed. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the readout of these channels as efficiently as possible with a bunch crossing frequency of 40 MHz three different readout architectures were investigated by the ATLAS collaboration - analogue, digital and binary. Work in this thesis contributed to the decision by ATLAS to adopt the binary readout architecture after it was successfully tested in test-beam and bench-top studies. The physics studies to be performed at ATLAS impose stringent requirements on the precision with which the various trackers of the detector must measure the position of track points created by charged particles as they traverse the detector. The tracking resolutions achievable with these detectors are dependent on, among other things, the precision with which positions of detector elements are known during data taking. An optical metrology system known as frequency scanning interferometry (FSI) is shown in this thesis to be capable of providing real time detector alignment information. Finally, B-quark tagging is expected {{to play a major role}} in studying a large fraction of interesting physics signatures at the LHC. This thesis studies the degradation to b-tagging efficiency and light-jet rejection when a Mayer is not present. Furthermore, results of the b-tagging study are used to investigate the precision with which the mass difference of the up-squark and the lightest neutralino can be studied at SUGRA point 6.

This would allow operating LHCb at ten times the current design luminosity and improving the trigger efficiencies in order to collect more than ten times the statistics foreseen in the first phase. In this paper we present the new architecture in consideration. In particular, we investigate new technologies and protocols for the distribution of timing and synchronous control commands, and rate control. This so called Timing and Fast Control (TFC) system will also perform a central destination control for the events and manage the load balancing of the readout network and the event filter farm. The TFC system will be centred on a single FPGA-based multimaster allowing concurrent stand-alone operation of any subset of sub-detectors. The TFC distribution network under investigation will consist of a bidirectional optical network based on the high-speed transceivers embedded in the latest generation of FPGAs with special measures to have full control of the phase and latency of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>clock</b> and information.

The device has a low cost, on-chip VCO that locks to either 8 × or 16 × the frequency at the 19. 44 MHz or 9. 72 MHz input. No external components are needed for frequency synthesis; however, the user can adjust loop dynamics through selection of a damping factor capacitor whose value determines loop damping. The AD 809 design guarantees that the clock output frequency will drift low (by roughly 20 %) {{in the absence of a}} signal at the input.
