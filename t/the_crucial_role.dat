5|$|As {{the author}} of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, written in 1789, Lafayette was a staunch {{opponent}} to the concept of slavery. His writing was adopted as part of the French Constitution and included revolutionary ideas such as the freedom and equality of all men. His work never specifically mentioned slavery; however, he made clear his position on the controversial topic through letters addressed to friends and colleagues, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Lafayette proposed that slaves not be owned but rather work as free tenants on the land of plantation owners. In 1785, Lafayette bought a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne to begin putting his experimental ideas into practice. He ordered that none of his slaves be bought or sold. He spent his lifetime as an abolitionist, proposing slaves be emancipated slowly, recognizing <b>the</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> slavery played in many economies. He hoped his ideas would be adopted by George Washington in order to free the slaves in the United States of America and hopefully spread from there. His efforts were not in vain, as George Washington eventually began implementing Lafayette's practices in his own plantation in Mount Vernon. Also, following Lafayette's death in 1834, his grandson, Gustave de Beaumont released a novel discussing the issues of racism. Lafayette's role in the eventual abolition of slavery in 1794 in France was monumental, as riots in Saint Domingue erupted because of the circulation of his own writing in 1792, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.|$|E

40|$|Neutrino-oscillation {{solutions}} for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino deficit can determine {{the texture of the}} neutrino mass matrix according to three types of neutrino mass hierarchies as Type A: m 1 ≪ m 2 ≪ m 3, Type B: m 1 ∼ m 2 ≫ m 3, and Type C: m 1 ∼ m 2 ∼ m 3, where mi is the i-th generation neutrino absolute mass. The relative sign assignments of neutrino masses in each type of mass hierarchies play <b>the</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>roles</b> for <b>the</b> stability against quantum corrections. Actually, two physical Majorana phases in the lepton flavor mixing matrix connect among the relative sign assignments of neutrino masses. Therefore, in this paper we analyze the stability of mixing angles against quantum corrections according to three types of neutrino mass hierarchies (Type A, B, C) and two Majorana phases.

She wrote Biblically based introductions to astronomy and ancient history so that children would have Christian textbooks.

[...] Sherwood also revised classic children's books to make them appropriately religious, such as Sarah Fielding's The Governess (1749). [...] Sherwood's efforts to make religion more palatable through children's fiction were not always regarded favorably by the entire evangelical community; The Evangelical Magazine harshly reviewed her Stories Explanatory of the Church Catechism (1817), complaining that it was overly reliant on exciting fictional tales to convey its religious message.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} of protein folding {{was followed by}} research into the physical interactions that stabilize folded protein structures. [...] <b>The</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> of hydrophobic interactions was hypothesized by Dorothy Wrinch and Irving Langmuir, as a mechanism that might stabilize her cyclol structures. [...] Although supported by J. D. Bernal and others, this (correct) hypothesis was rejected along with the cyclol hypothesis, which was disproven in the 1930s by Linus Pauling (among others). Instead, Pauling championed the idea that protein structure was stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds, an idea advanced initially by William Astbury (1933). [...] Remarkably, Pauling's incorrect theory about H-bonds resulted in his correct models for the secondary structure elements of proteins, the alpha helix and the beta sheet. [...] The hydrophobic interaction was restored to its correct prominence by a famous article in 1959 by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on work by Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang. [...] The ionic nature of proteins was demonstrated by Bjerrum, Weber and Arne Tiselius, but Linderstrom-Lang showed that the charges were generally accessible to solvent and not bound to each other (1949).|$|E
