25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} a nucleogenic nuclide would be neon-21 {{produced}} from neon-20 that absorbs a thermal neutron, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> neon-21 (some neon-21 is also primordial). Other nucleogenic reactions that produce heavy neon isotopes are (fast neutron capture, alpha emission) reactions, starting with magnesium-24 and magnesium-25, respectively. The source of the neutrons in these reactions is often secondary neutrons produced by alpha radiation from natural uranium and thorium in rock.|$|E
50|$|Creases on the brain's surface {{are formed}} {{as a result of}} instability, and {{tangential}} growth models reach levels of instability that cause creasing more frequently than isotropic models.

Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, prior to their rupture, produced very little if any stenosis.|$|R
50|$|The size of {{particles}} in a material's crystal lattice changes the Curie temperature. Due {{to the small}} size {{of particles}} (nanoparticles) the fluctuations of electron spins become more prominent, this results in the Curie temperature drastically decreasing when the size of particles decrease as the fluctuations cause disorder. The size of a particle also affects the anisotropy causing alignment <b>to</b> <b>become</b> less <b>stable</b> and thus lead to disorder in magnetic moments.|$|R

50|$|Once a prototypical {{begins to}} form, all {{particles}} bound by its gravity begin to free fall towards it. The time taken for this free-fall to conclude can be approximated using the free-fall equations. Most galaxies have completed this free-fall stage <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> elliptical or disk galaxies, the disks taking longer to fully form. The formation of galaxy clusters takes much longer {{and is still}} in progress now. This stage is also where galaxies acquire most of their angular momentum. A protogalaxy acquires this due to gravitational influence from neighbouring dense clumps in the early universe, and the further the gas is away from the centre, the more spin it gets.|$|E
5000|$|The heavily {{traveled}} Great Wagon Road was {{the primary}} route for the early settlement of the Southern United States, particularly the [...] "backcountry". Although {{a wide variety of}} settlers traveled southward on the road, two dominant cultures emerged. The German Palatines and Scotch-Irish American immigrants arrived in huge numbers because of unendurable conditions in Europe. The Germans (also known as Pennsylvania Dutch) tended to find rich farmland and work it zealously <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> and prosperous. The other group (known also as Presbyterian or Ulster Scots) tended to be restless, clannish, and fiercely independent; they formed {{what became known as the}} Appalachian Culture. Partly because of the language difference, the two groups tended to keep to themselves.|$|E
50|$|The {{noble gases}} of the {{periodic}} table {{do not have a}} charge because they are nonreactive. Noble gases are considered stable since they contain the desired eight electrons. The other atoms or ions have charges because they are very reactive and want to react with another atom or ion <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable.</b> When elements are bonded, they can either be bonded by ionic bonding or covalent bonding. When elements bond between positive and negative charged atoms, their charges will be switched and carried down on the other element to combine them equally. This is shown below. Using the chart provided, if ammonium with a plus 1 charge is combined with an acetate ion with a negative 1 charge, the charges will be cancelled out, shown in the figure below.|$|E
5|$|For an implant <b>to</b> <b>become</b> {{permanently}} <b>stable,</b> {{the body}} must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{applying}} strain on half-doped manganites {{makes it possible}} to tune the system to the proximity of a metal-insulator transition and thereby generate a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) response. This phase competition not only allows control of CMR in ferromagnetic metallic manganites but can be used to generate CMR response in otherwise robust insulators at half-doping. Further, from our realistic microscopic model of strain and magnetotransport calculations within the Kubo formalism, we demonstrate a striking result of strain engineering that, under tensile strain, a ferromagnetic charge-ordered insulator, previously inaccessible <b>to</b> experiments, <b>becomes</b> <b>stable...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{crystallization}} Nucleation is {{the step}} where the solute molecules or atoms dispersed in the solvent start to gather into clusters, on the microscopic scale (elevating solute concentration {{in a small}} region), that become stable under the current operating conditions. These stable clusters constitute the nuclei. Therefore, the clusters need to reach a critical size in order <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> nuclei. Such critical size is dictated by many different factors (temperature, supersaturation, etc.). It is at the stage of nucleation that the atoms or molecules arrange in a defined and periodic manner that defines the crystal structure — note that [...] "crystal structure" [...] is a special term that refers to the relative arrangement of the atoms or molecules, not the macroscopic properties of the crystal (size and shape), although those {{are a result of}} the internal crystal structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{country of}} Burundi is at grave {{risk for a}} {{possible}} civil war, if violence is not stopped. The civilians of Burundi face the serious and eminent risk of mass atrocities due to the ongoing political violence that threatens the stability of Burundi. The citizens of Burundi are being harmed through mass atrocity crimes due to targeted killings, widespread violations and abuses of human rights. Violence had increased after President Pierre Nkurnziza had announced he was seeking a third term in the country’s elections. Violence had increased due to President Nkurnziza instructing his citizens to disarm or face action by Burundian Security forces and be labeled enemies of the nation. Office of high commissioner for human rights reports cases of sexual violence by security forces, hate speech and incitement to violence by some government officials. In order for this country <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable</b> again it is crucial {{for the country to}} uphold its R2P, as well as make peace-building gains.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{documentation}} of the chickens of Bresse reportedly dates from 12 November 1591, when the citizens of Bourg presented two dozen birds to Joachim de Rye, Marquis de Treffort. In the early nineteenth century, the lawyer, politician, epicure and gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826), who was born at Belley in the Ain, {{is supposed to have}} described the Bresse chicken as [...] "the queen of poultry, the poultry of kings". Like the La Flèche, which was raised and fattened in a similar fashion, the Bresse chicken had high standing in the market. Nevertheless, by about 1900 the breed had virtually disappeared. Its recovery was due to fancy breeders, who selectively bred a sufficient number of white chickens for the breed <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>stable.</b> A new breed standard was drawn up in 1904. The Bresse name, used for both chicken products and for the dinde de Bresse, the turkey of the area, received legal protection on 22 December 1936; this became an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) in 1957.|$|E
40|$|Bose-Einstein condensates with {{attractive}} interatomic interactions undergo collective collapse {{beyond a}} critical number.
