It was past nine o'clock before he presented himself at the tobacco-shop, bringing in with him a goodly share of mud and wet from the <b>thawing</b> <b>ground</b> and rainy sky outside. His long walk {{did not seem to}} have relieved the uneasiness of mind which had induced him to separate so suddenly from Zack. He talked almost perpetually to himself in a muttering, incoherent way; his heavy brow was contracted, and the scars of the old wounds on his face looked angry and red. The first thing he did was to make some inquiries of his landlord relating to railway traveling, and to the part of London in which a certain terminus that he had been told of was situated. Finding it not easy to make him understand any directions connected with this latter point, the shopkeeper suggested sending for a cab {{to take him to the}} railway. He briefly assented to that arrangement; occupying the time before the vehicle arrived, in walking sullenly backwards and forwards over the pavement in front of the shop door.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ground {{temperature}} variations {{have been}} analysed to {{the depth of}} 160 cm, with respect to meteorological elements and short−wave radiation balance. The database of the ground temperature covers a thirteen month−long period (May 1992 – June 1993), which in− cluded both the seasons of complete freezing of the ground and thaw. Special {{attention has been given}} to the development of perennial permafrost and its spatial distribution. In summer, the depth of <b>thawing</b> <b>ground</b> varied in different types of ground — at the Polish Polar Station, this was ca. 130 cm. The ground froze completely {{in the first week of}} October. Its thawing started in June. The snow cover restrained heat penetration in the ground, which hindered the ground thawing process. Cross−correlation shows a significant influence of the radiation bal− ance (K*) on the values of near−surface ground temperatures (r 2 = 0. 62 for summer) ...|$|E
40|$|One of the geomechanics {{challenges}} is {{the quantitative}} assessment of deformation of soils associated with frost heaving and thawing. The main difficulty in solving this problem {{is the need to}} consider changing the state of soil freezing and <b>thawing</b> <b>ground</b> and thermophysical characteristics of the medium in a transient state. The main process in frozen soil is the redistribution of moisture in them due to water migration during freezing. When water freezes, the soil characteristics, its physical and mechanical properties change. This paper includes description of a numerical simulation method and study about humidity changing in frozen soils, depending on the rate of soil freezing. The influence of soil humidity changing on the values of strength characteristics during the process of thawing is evaluated. The developed technique of numerical simulation of the freezing and thawing process allows assessing the impact of frost heaving forces, decreasing the strength of buildings foundations and structures during freezing and thawing at the design stage. This allows the effective implementing of modern structures for soils and foundations reinforcement using geosynthetics to reduce or eliminate frost heave processes and thawing...|$|E

Some experts argue that the ground may have become quickly saturated, resulting in runoff and flash flooding. Others have suggested that frozen ground in tributary watersheds {{may have contributed to}} the flooding along the rivers. Up to 8 in of snow followed the heavy rain in northern Indiana.

Hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species, which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the Old and New Worlds, would be left isolated on distant mountain-summits (having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic regions of both hemispheres.|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of a soil increases when the ground freezes, {{but some of the}} water will remain unfrozen. Unfrozen water content is an important thermal property of a soil as flowing water may supply heat, reduce the strength, and <b>thawing</b> <b>ground</b> will experience reduced soil strength and increased settlements. Thus, estimating the unfrozen water content is important for geotechnical design considerations in permafrost areas. Additionally, hydraulic and thermal responses of climate changes can be simulated. Reliable methods for determining unfrozen water content in frozen soil exist, but requires sophisticated instruments and is time consuming. For engineering purposes, more simple and efficient methods are desired. In this thesis, more recently developed methods for determining unfrozen water content in fine grained soils have been examined, liquid limit determination and water potential testing in particular. Soil samples from Longyearbyen and Trondheim have been examined and tested in the laboratories of UNIS and NTNU, using liquid limit determination and water potential testing. The test methods have been evaluated and compared against each other. New parameters adapted to Norwegian clays are proposed for the liquid limit determination. A geothermal Plaxis model for finding thermal properties of fine grained soils are tested on the soils. The model estimates the frost penetration depth, and the result is compared to results obtained by hand calculations. With improvements, the model has potential to become a useful tool in geotechnical designs in permafrost areas...|$|E
40|$|From {{the passive}} L-band {{microwave}} radiometer onboard the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) space mission global surface soil moisture data is retrieved every 3 days. Thus far, the empirical L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) radiative transfer model {{applied in the}} SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm is exclusively calibrated over test sites in dry and temperate climate zones and the included dielectric mixing model relating soil moisture to permittivity accounts only for mineral soils. However, soil moisture monitoring over the higher northern latitudes is crucial since these regions are especially sensitive to climate change and a considerable feedback is expected due to carbon liberated from <b>thawing</b> <b>ground</b> of these extremely organic soils. Due to differing structural characteristics and thus varying bound water fractions, the permittivity of organic material {{is lower than the}} one of most mineral soils at a given water content. This assumption was verified by means of measurements in organic and mineral substrates from various sites in Denmark, Finland, Scotland and Siberia. For this purpose, conventional soil moisture sensors were used as well as weak perturbation and waveguide techniques in order to infer effective soil permittivity at the microwave L-band (1 - 2 GHz). Based on these data, a generic L-band soil moisture – permittivity relation for organic soils was derived and validated with dielectric mixing model runs as well as literature data. Furthermore, the derived function was tested in the L-MEB model. Results showed that modeled data agreed with measurements from a tower-based passive L-band microwave radiometer observing organic-rich soil over a 2 months period in a highly controlled set-up. The generic «organic» empirical model was then implemented in the SMOS Prototype Algorithm to retrieve soil moisture over a site in Northern Finland. The validation with in situ soil moisture observations calibrated for organic soils showed a distinct improvement in the agreement between the satellite and ground datasets when using the «organic» instead of the operational SMOS processor version. This analysis is to be continued in more detail and the validation effort needs to be expanded over as many regions with abundant soil organic matter content as possible. Appropriate in situ observations are currently available from various sites in Alaska, Canada, and the Netherlands. In this communication, first the derivation of the generic L-band «organic» soil moisture-permittivity model will be presented. Focus will then be on the comparison of «organic» SMOS soil moisture retrievals with corresponding operational SMOS products as well as in situ observations over all available sites...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} and <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> state are both {{indicative of a}} hillslope’s ability to transfer water. In cold regions in particular, it is widely known that the wetness of surface soils and depth of <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> are important for runoff generation, but the diversity of interactions between surface soil {{moisture and}} <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> themselves has not been studied. To fill this knowledge gap, detailed shallow soil moisture and thaw depth surveys were conducted along systematic grids at the Baker Creek Basin, Northwest Territories. Multiple hillslopes were studied {{to determine how the}} interactions differed along a spectrum of topological, typological and topographic situations (T³ template). Results did not show a simple relationship between soil moisture and <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> as was expected. Instead, correlation was a function of wetness such that the correlation between soil moisture and <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> improved with site wetness. To understand why differences in soil moisture and <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> state arose, water and energy fluxes were examined for these subarctic study sites to discern the key processes controlling the patterns observed. Results showed that the key control in variable soil moisture and frost table interactions among the sites was the presence of surface water. At the peatland and wetland sites, accumulated water in depressions and flow paths maintained soil moisture for a longer duration than at the hummock tops. These wet areas were often locations of deepest thaw depth due to the transfer of latent heat accompanying lateral surface runoff. Although the peatland and wetland sites had large inundation extents, modified Péclet numbers indicated that the relative influence of external and internal hydrological processes at each site were different. Continuous inflow from an upstream lake into the wetland site caused advective and conductive thermal energies to be of equal importance to <b>ground</b> <b>thaw.</b> The absence of continuous surface flow at the peatland and valley sites led to the dominance of conductive thermal energy over advective energy for <b>ground</b> <b>thaw.</b> A quantitative explanation for the shallow soil moisture-ground thaw patterns was provided by linking hydrological processes and hillslope storage capacity with the calculated water and energy fluxes as well as the modified Péclet number. These results suggest that the T³ template and the modified Péclet number could be very useful parameters for differentiating landscape components in modeling soil moisture and frost table heterogeneity in cold regions...|$|R

40|$|Much of the world’s {{boreal forest}} occurs on {{permafrost}} (perennially cryotic ground). As such, changes in permafrost conditions {{have implications for}} forest function and, within the zone of discontinuous permafrost (30 – 80 % perma-frost in areal extent), distribution. Here, forested peat plateaus underlain by permafrost are elevated above the surrounding permafrost-free wetlands; as permafrost <b>thaws,</b> <b>ground</b> surface subsidence leads to waterlogging at forest margins. Within the North American subarctic, recent warming has produced rapid, widespread permafrost thaw and corresponding forest loss. Although permafrost thaw-induced forest loss provides a natural analogue to deforestation occurring in more southerly locations, we know little about how fragmentation relates to subsequent permafrost thaw and forest loss or the role of changing conditions {{at the edges of}} forested plateaus. We address these knowledge gaps by (i) examining the relationship of forest loss to the degree of fragmentation in a boreal peatland in the Northwest Territories, Canada; and (ii) quantifying associated biotic and abiotic changes occurring across forest-wetland transitions and extending into the forested plateaus (i. e., edge effects). We demonstrate that the rate of forest loss correlates positively with the degree of fragmentation as quantified by perimeter to area ratio of peat plateaus (edge: area).

Few Land Surface Models (LSMs) and Hydrological Models (HMs) have been developed, adapted or tested for frozen conditions and permafrost soils. Considering the vast geographical area influenced by freeze/thaw processes and permafrost, and the rapid environmental change observed worldwide in these regions, a need exists to improve models to better represent their hydrology. In this study, various infiltration algorithms and parameterisation methods, which are commonly employed in current LSMs and HMs were tested against detailed measurements at three sites in Canada's discontinuous permafrost region with organic soil depths ranging from 0. 02 to 3 m. Field data from two consecutive years were used to calibrate and evaluate the infiltration algorithms and parameterisations. Important conclusions include: (1) {{the single most important}} factor that controls the infiltration at permafrost sites is <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> depth, (2) differences among the simulated infiltration by different algorithms and parameterisations were only found when the ground was frozen or during the initial fast thawing stages, but not after <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> reaches a critical depth of 15 – 30 cm, (3) despite similarities in simulated total infiltration after <b>ground</b> <b>thaw</b> reaches the critical depth, the choice of algorithm influenced the distribution of water among the soil layers, and (4) the ice impedance factor for hydraulic conductivity, which is commonly used in LSMs and HMs, may not be necessary once the water potential driven frozen soil parameterisation is employed.
