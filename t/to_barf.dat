40|$|The current {{treatment}} of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a tumour common in southern Chinese people, {{is dependent on}} chemo/radiosensitivity. Patients with {{early stages of the}} disease are usually chemo and radiosensitive with 5 years survival rates of 90 % whereas, patients with late-stages of the disease or relapse have between 20 - 70 % survival rates. These statistics indicate a need for a treatment to improve the overall survival rates in NPC patients, especially for those with relapse. Immunotherapy is a prime candidate for such treatment due to its association with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, expression of EBV antigens in NPC tumour cells and the presence of EBV-specific T cells at the tumour site. More importantly, studies in other EBV-associated diseases strongly indicated that CD 8 + T cell based immunotherapy targeting EBV antigens could control EBV infection and also tumour regression in some patients, however, most patients show poor tumour response rate due to ineffective maintenance of EBV-specific CD 8 + T cells. Studies have also shown that CD 4 + T cells are important in the control of viral infection by maintaining an effective CD 8 + T cell response and as effectors in its own right. CD 4 + T cell responses to EBV antigens have only been studied in the Caucasian population and not in Chinese people where NPC incidence is high. This thesis work was prompted with these points in mind. In this thesis, the screening in 25 Caucasian donors (24 donors are EBV-seropositive and 1 donor was EBV-seronegative {{at the time of this}} study) for T cell responses (CD 8 + and CD 4 +) against the predicted BART products and BARF 1 protein. The BART and BARF 1 transcripts are expressed in NPC tumour cells, but their expression as proteins have never been identified until Kienzle et al (1998) reported the finding of CD 8 + T cell response to one of the products encoded by the BART transcript, BARF 0. In this study, no CD 8 + or CD 4 + T cell responses were detected against the BART products or <b>to</b> <b>BARF</b> 1 protein, and concluded that if responses do exist, they are probably rare responses and would have little or no immunotherapeutic value. The attention of this thesis work was then shifted to studying an EBV protein that is uniformly identified in NPC tumour cells, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) 1. CD 4 + T cell response against EBNA 1 has been studied in the Caucasian population, however, little is known about CD 4 + T cell epitopes presented by HLA alleles in Chinese people. In this study, CD 4 + T cell responses in 78 healthy Chinese EBV carriers were analyzed and found marked focusing of epitopes in the EBNA 1 C-terminal region, including a DP 5 -restricted epitope recognized by almost half of the donors tested. More importantly, EBNA 1 -specific CD 4 + T cell clones to this DP 5 -restricted epitope could recognize EBNA 1 -expressing, DP 5 -positive target cells. However, further studies are required to determine the role of these EBNA 1 -specific CD 4 + T cells in T cell based therapy...|$|E

NPC tumor cells express viral proteins, including BARF 1, which is secreted {{and is considered}} to have oncogenic and immune-modulating properties. Recently, we found conserved mutations in the BARF 1 gene in NPC isolates. This study describes the expression and purification of NPC-derived BARF 1 and analyzes humoral immune responses against prototype BARF 1 (B 95 - 8) and purified native hexameric BARF 1 in sera of Indonesian NPC patients (n = 155) compared to healthy EBV-positive (n = 56) and EBV-negative (n = 16) individuals. BARF 1 (B 95 - 8) expressed in Escherichia coli and baculovirus, as well as BARF 1 -derived peptides, did not react with IgG or IgA antibodies in NPC. Purified native hexameric BARF 1 protein isolated from culture medium was used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and revealed relatively weak IgG and IgA responses in human sera, although it had strong antibody responses to other EBV proteins. Higher IgG reactivity was found in NPC patients (P = 0. 015) than in regional Indonesian controls or EBV-negative individuals (P < 0. 001). IgA responses <b>to</b> native <b>BARF</b> 1 were marginal. NPC sera with the highest IgG responses <b>to</b> hexameric <b>BARF</b> 1 in ELISA showed detectable reactivity with denatured BARF 1 by immunoblotting. In conclusion, BARF 1 has low immunogenicity for humoral responses and requires native conformation for antibody binding.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that BARF 1 gene has either an immortalizing effect, when expressed in primary primate epithelial cells, or a malignant transforming activity, when expressed in established and nontumoral rodent fibroblast or human B-cell lines.

Thus, as an initial step <b>to</b> clarify <b>BARF</b> 1 oncogenic functions, we investigated whether the secreted form of BARF 1 protein can activate the cell cycle as a growth factor. Since efficient BARF 1 expression could be obtained from 293 -tTA cells infected with a tetracycline-regulatable recombinant adenovirus, secreted BARF 1 product could be purified from the culture medium of such cells by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromotography and sucrose gradient sedimentation. We describe in this paper that addition of a purified product of secreted <b>BARF</b> 1 protein <b>to</b> serum-free culture medium of Balb/c 3 T 3 rodent fibroblasts, human Louckes B-cell line and primary monkey kidney epithelial cells resulted in a cell cycle activation that was inhibited by affinity-purified anti-BARF 1 antibody.

40|$|Although promising, {{clinical}} {{responses to}} adoptive immunotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still {{limited by the}} restricted number of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens that can be targeted and their poor immunogenicity. Our previous work indicated that the immunogenic features of the NPC-associated viral antigen BARF 1 may be exploited for immunotherapeutic purposes. Nevertheless, T-cell lines obtained with current protocols include only negligible numbers of BARF 1 -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, pointing {{to the need to}} enrich these effectors in BARF 1 specificities. Considering that in B lymphocytes BARF 1 is mainly a lytic EBV antigen, we tested different EBV lytic-cycle inducers (TPA/butyric acid, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) used at suboptimal concentrations for their ability <b>to</b> upregulate <b>BARF</b> 1 expression in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines (LCL), the commonly used antigen-presenting cells, without compromising their survival. The LCLs treated with doxo-rubicin (DX-LCL) can reproducibly and efficiently generate EBV-specific effectors enriched in BARF 1 specificities from both healthy donors and NPC patients. These DX-LCLs also had more pronounced immunogenic properties, including HLA class I upregulation and expression of immunogenic cell death markers, such as enhanced calreticulin exposure and HMGB 1 release. In particular, doxorubicin triggers an HMGB 1 autocrine/paracrine loop with its receptor, TLR 4, which is also upregulated in DX-LCLs and is responsible for NF-kappa B activation and a delayed apoptosis that allows a prolonged stimulation of EBV-specific T-cell precursors. This protocol may thus constitute a valid alternative to the use of engineered LCLs to generate EBV-specific T-cell lines for adoptive immunotherapy, being relatively simple, easily upgradable to Good Manufacturing Practice standards, and therefore more broadly applicable...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BamHI-A rightward frame 1 (BARF 1) is {{considered}} a major viral oncogene in epithelial cells and has immune-modulating properties. However, in B cells and lymphomas, BARF 1 expression is restricted to the viral lytic replication cycle. In this report, the transcriptional regulation of BARF 1 during lytic replication is unraveled. Bisulfite sequencing of various cell lines indicated {{a high level of}} methylation of the BARF 1 gene control region. A BARF 1 promoter luciferase reporter construct was created using a CpG-free vector, enabling true assessment of promoter methylation. Induction of the EBV lytic cycle is mediated by the immediate-early proteins BZLF 1 (Z) and BRLF 1 (R). R was found to activate expression of the BARF 1 promoter up to 250 -fold independently of Z and unaffected by BARF 1 promoter methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and specific mutagenesis of the R-responsive elements (RREs) demonstrated direct binding of R to RREs between nucleotides - 554 and - 327 relative <b>to</b> the <b>BARF</b> 1 transcriptional ATG start site. The kinetics of BARF 1 expression upon transactivation by R showed that BARF 1 mRNA was expressed within 6 h {{in the context of the}} viral genome. In conclusion, expression of the BARF 1 protein during lytic replication is regulated by direct binding of R to multiple RREs in the gene control region and is independent of the promoter methylation status. The early kinetics of BARF 1 upon transactivation by R confirm its status as an early gene and emphasize the necessity of early immune modulation during lytic reactivatio...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although adoptive {{infusion}} of EBV-specific T cell lines constitutes a promising strategy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) therapy, however, the clinical benefit of current protocols is still poor. One major limitation is constituted by the restricted number of EBV antigens {{that can be}} targeted and their poor immunogenicity. The oncogenic EBV protein BARF 1 is expressed {{in the majority of}} NPC cases and may constitute an optimal target. We have previously demonstrated that NPC patients have strong spontaneous CD 4 and CD 8 T cell responses against BARF 1 protein and derived epitopes. Moreover, BARF 1 -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can be easily generated from healthy donors. Nevertheless, T cell lines obtained with current protocols for adoptive immunotherapy of NPC include only negligible numbers of BARF 1 -specific CTLs, pointing to the need to implement these T-cell cultures in BARF 1 specificities. AIM: To develop optimized, GMP-upgradable protocols for adoptive immunotherapy of NPC based on the generation of T-cell lines enriched in BARF 1 -specific effectors METHODS: Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were treated with different EBV lytic cycle inducers at doses able to induce abortive or limited EBV replication while preserving cell viability. Expression of EBNA 2, BARF 1, LMP 1, ZEBRA and EA mRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. EBV-specific donor- and patients-derived CTLs were generated with LCLs treated with the different drugs from PBMCs. Standard cytotocxicity assays were used to assess the specificity of CTLs. Content in Granzyme B granules was assessed by multispectral imaging flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with low doses of doxorubicin (DX) proved to be the most suitable and simple protocol <b>to</b> enhance <b>BARF</b> 1 expression (3. 3 fold increase), without down-regulating other viral antigens that are targeted by EBV-specific CTLs. By contrast, TPA/Na-butyrate (TPA+NaB) or cisplatin (CSP) were less effective in up-regulating BARF- 1 and induced higher levels of cell apoptosis.

Nasopharyngeal brushings from 56 NPC cases, blood or tissue from 15 other EBV-related disorders, spontaneous B cell lines (LCL) from 5 Indonesian healthy individuals and several prototype EBV isolates were analysed by PCRdirect sequencing. Results: Most NPC isolates revealed specific BARF 1 nucleotide changes compared to prototype B 95 - 8 virus. At the protein level these mutations resulted in 3 main substitutions (V 29 A, W 72 G, H 130 R), which are not considered to cause gross tertiary structure alterations in the hexameric BARF 1 protein.

40|$|The BARF 1 gene {{is located}} in the BamHI-A {{fragment}} of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome, encodes 221 amino acids, and has activity as an oncogene. Several reports have demonstrated that BARF 1 is expressed in the tissues of various EBV-associated epithelioid malignancies. However,BARF 1 is thought to be a lytic gene, since its expression is induced upon induction of the lytic cycle in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that BARF 1 expression in EBV-associated epithelioid malignancies reflects spontaneous induction of the lytic cycle in carcinoma cells. The present study aimed <b>to</b> clarify whether <b>BARF</b> 1 was expressed as a latent gene or a lytic gene in epithelioid malignancies. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay revealed that BARF 1 was highly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues in the absence of expression of lytic genes. On the other hand, BARF 1 protein was detectable only in two of seven NPC tissue samples by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of BARF 1 -transfected CNE 1 cells revealed that BARF 1 was quickly secreted into culture medium and was hardly detectable in the cell lysate, which would account for why some NPC tissues were negative for BARF 1 protein expression even though they were strongly positive forBARF 1 expression at the transcriptional level. The present findings indicate that BARF 1 is expressed in NPC and EBV-positive gastric carcinoma tissues as a latent gene and suggest that BARF 1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of these malignancies.

In the present study, we have characterized the immunogenicity of the EBV-encoded BARF 1 oncogene with the aim to assess whether this protein could constitute a new target antigen for immunotherapy in this setting. Spontaneous CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses specific for the recombinant p 29 BARF 1 protein were detected by IFNγ-ELISPOT in both EBV-seropositive donors and UNPC patients, but not in EBV-seronegative individuals. Using immunoinformatic prediction tools, we have selected 5 different candidate BARF 1 T cell epitopes presented by HLA-A* 0201. Although {{only one of these}} peptides was able to bind HLA-A 2 with low affinity in the T 2 stabilization assay, all 5 BARF 1 nonamers readily elicited specific CD 8 + T cell responses in EBV-seropositive HLA-A* 0201 + donors and UNPC patients. Notably, the magnitude of CD 8 + T cell responses <b>to</b> the whole <b>BARF</b> 1 protein and derived A* 0201 peptides was significantly higher in UNPC patients than in healthy donors.

40|$|Fluorous {{chemistry}} {{has seen}} a number of advances since its birth in the early 1990 s. One of the most attractive characteristics of fluorous solvents is their unique solubility properties depending on temperature. This phenomenon {{has led to the}} development of a wide range of catalysts that are modified with fluorous tags and are used in biphasic catalysis and easily recovered. Many fluorous phase transfer catalysts are confined to bringing small ions into fluorous media by using fluorous onium or crown ether vehicles. The most popular method to bring transition metal complexes into fluorous media is quite limited, usually resulting in ligand tuning and thus a change in reactivity at the metal center. This can be circumvented by pairing a cationic transition metal with a highly fluorous anion rendering the neutral species highly fluorophilic. To achieve this goal, we chose <b>to</b> use fluorous <b>BArf?,</b> [B(3, 5 -C?H?(Rf?) ?) ?]?, as the mode of transport and pair it with classic Werner-type complexes that recently have been shown act as organocatalysts in enantioselective Michael additions. The literature synthesis of Na[B(3, 5 -C?H?(Rf?) ?) ?] (3) was improved and through salt metathesis two new fluorophilic salts were made. The Werner-type trication [Co(en) ?]?? was solubilized in PFMC (perfluoromethylcyclohexane) to generate [Co(en) ?][B(3, 5 -C?H?(Rf?) ?) ?]? (4). This fluorophilic salt was found to be preferentially soluble in fluorous media with a partition coefficient in PFMC/H?O of 99. 0 : 1. 0 and in PFMC/CH?C?H? of > 99. 3 :< 0. 7. Another Werner-type trication, [Co(R,R-chxn) ?]??, was also paired with [B(3, 5 -C?H?(Rf?) ?) ?]? to afford [Co(R,R-chxn) ?][B(3, 5 -C?H?(Rf?) ?) ?]? (5), whose partition coefficients in PFMC/H?O and PFMC/CH?C?H? were the same as 4. Within the scope of Werner-type complexes, this work constitutes a significant stride toward developing a series of compounds that bring the concept of organocatalysis into fluorous media. The new compounds 3 - 5 show high preferences for the fluorous phase and provide a baseline for future Werner-type salt metathesis with fluorous BArf?...|$|R
