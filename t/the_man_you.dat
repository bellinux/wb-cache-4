You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>you</b> think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
500|$|According to Meredith, Mugabe {{presented}} himself as [...] "articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory" [...] after his 1980 election victory. Blair noted {{that at this}} period of his career, Mugabe displayed [...] "genuine magnanimity and moral courage" [...] despite his [...] "intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred" [...] toward {{the members of the}} former regime. Following his dealing with Mugabe during the 1979 negotiations, Michael Pallister, head of the British Foreign Office, described Mugabe as having [...] "a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner". The British diplomat Peter Longworth stated that in private, Mugabe was [...] "very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>you</b> meet with the man ranting on television". Norman stated that [...] "I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings. He also had a warm side to him which I saw quite clearly sometimes".|$|E
500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>you</b> have to know {{what was happening in the}} world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, {{if for no other}} reason than his persistence" [...] in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When was the last time you could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put it all on the line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>you</b> want to be fighting side by side with." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked Raynor as the 24th greatest soldier in video games.|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales was a {{ruthless}} competitor with a fierce temper. Many {{of his peers}} on the professional circuit were intimidated by him, and he was often at odds with officials and promoters, {{but he was a}} fan favorite who drew the most spectators. After his death, a Sports Illustrated article stated: [...] "If earth was on the line in a tennis match, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>you</b> want serving to save humankind would be Ricardo Alonso Gonzales." [...] Longtime tennis commentator Bud Collins echoed this in 2006: [...] "If I had to choose someone to play for my life, it would be Pancho Gonzales." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{raise money}} in 1976, Duke (using the double {{pseudonym}} [...] "Dorothy Vanderbilt" [...] and [...] "James Konrad") wrote a self-help book for women, Finders-Keepers: Finding and Keeping <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>You</b> Want, which contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, and {{was published by}} the now defunct Arlington Place Books. Tulane University history professor Lawrence N. Powell, who read a rare {{copy of the book}} given to him by journalist Patsy Sims, wrote that it includes advice on vaginal exercises, fellatio, and anal sex. The book is out of print and difficult to find; however, according to journalist Tyler Bridges, The Times-Picayune obtained a copy and traced its provenance to Duke, who compiled the content from women's self-help magazines.|$|E
