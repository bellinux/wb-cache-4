5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as in United States v.

The rest of this section explains these arguments in more detail.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{free will}} defense begins by asserting that Mackie's {{argument}} failed {{to establish an}} explicit logical contradiction between God {{and the existence of}} evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remain unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the kippa has two sides. The Vilna Gaon {{said one}} can make a berakhah without a kippah, since wearing a kippah is only an midos chassidus ("exemplary attribute").

25|$|Because the Constitution lacks a clear {{statement}} {{authorizing the}} Federal courts to nullify {{the acts of}} coequal branches, critics contend that <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> judicial review must rely on a significant gloss on the Constitution's terms. Despite such criticisms of Marbury v. Madison, judicial review has been accepted in the American legal community.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Henderson, {{founder of}} the Boston Consulting Group, wrote about {{the concept of the}} {{experience}} curve in 1968, following initial work begun in 1965.

25|$|Another {{approach}} is to reject disjunctive syllogism. From the perspective of dialetheism, {{it makes perfect sense}} that disjunctive syllogism should fail. The idea behind this syllogism is that, if ¬ A, then A is excluded and B can be inferred from A ∨ B. However, if A may hold as well as ¬A, then <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the inference is weakened.|$|E

25|$|Opponents {{also pointed}} {{specifically}} {{to the lack of}} accessibility of the Routemaster in light of impending relevant legislation, which meant all new buses now entering service in London would be required to have a low-floor design.

25|$|Socrates begins one of {{the most}} {{influential}} dialogues of Western philosophy regarding <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> inborn knowledge.

The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (four feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be three feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss.|$|E
