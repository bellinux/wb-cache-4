5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

Arginine in TJI was lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> JL and UKO. No significant differences between breed/line were observed in histidine, threonine, glutamine, glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan.

5|$|Other sources include {{fortified}} food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ helper T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ helper T cells and Th17 helper T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E
5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> fed control formula.|$|E

5|$|P. xinjiangensis is {{distinguished}} by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened {{on the front}} end, {{as well as some}} features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the acetabulum (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16centimetres (6.3in). P. meileyingensis has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of P. lujiatunensis, and to a lesser degree in P. mongoliensis, P. sattayaraki, and P. sibiricus. The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7centimetres (5.5in) long. The dentary of P. sattayaraki has a flange similar to that found in P. mongoliensis, P. sibiricus, P. lujiatunensis and P. meileyingensis, although it is less pronounced <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as P. sinensis. The frontal bone of P. neimongoliensis is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2centimetres (5.2in) and a femoral length of 13centimetres (5.1in), but is not fully grown. An adult P. neimongoliensis was probably smaller than P. mongoliensis, with a proportionately longer skull and tail. P. ordosensis can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5centimeters (3.75in) in length.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism with Hcy metabolism and inflammatory response in patients with recurrent cerebral infarction. Methods: 40 patients with recurrent cerebral infarction who were treated in Yulin Third Hospital between December 2013 and December 2016 were selected as recurrent group, 58 patients with primary cerebral infarction were selected as primary group, and 60 healthy volunteers were selected as control group. Peripheral blood MTHFR gene C 677 T polymorphism and serum levels of Hcy metabolism indexes and inflammatory response indicators were determined. Results: CC genotype constituent ratio of recurrent group was significantly {{lower than that of}} primary group and control group while CT genotype and TT genotype constituent ratio were significantly higher than those of primary group and control group; serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in recurrent group and primary group were significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> control group while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> control group; serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in recurrent group were significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> primary group while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> primary group. Serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in patients with CC genotype were significantly lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> patients with CT genotype and TT genotype while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> patients with CT genotype and TT genotype; serum Hcy, HMGB 1, sCD 40 L, YKL- 40, Lp-PLA 2 and MMP- 9 levels in patients with CT genotype were significantly lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> patients with TT genotype while VitB 12 and FA levels were significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> patients with TT genotype.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of Huoxue Qianyang Granule (HXQYG), a traditional Chinese compound medicine, in revising the left ventricular hypertrophy of hypertension. Methods: Spontaneous hypertension rats (SHR) were randomly divided into seven groups: untreated group, Songling Xuemaikang (SLXMK) -treated group, captopril-treated group, high-, medium- and low-dose HXQYG-treated groups, and normal control group. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were measured. The content of angiotensin Ⅱ (AngⅡ) in left ventricular tissue was determined by radioimmunoassay. The expressions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) protein and mRNA in left ventricular tissue were analyzed separately by immunohistochemical method and RT-PCR. Results: (1) SBP and LVMI {{were higher in the}} untreated group <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the normal control group, and they were lower in the high- and medium-dose HXQYG-treated groups <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the untreated group, but higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the captopril-treated group, and without significant difference as compared to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the SLXMK-treated group. (2) The content of AngⅡ and expressions of ACE protein and mRNA in the left ventricular tissue in the untreated group were higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the normal control group, and they were lower in the HXQYG-treated groups <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the untreated group, but higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the captopril-treated group, and without significant difference as compared to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the SLXMK-treated group.

25|$|This {{question}} has been studied in isolated populations where antimalarial drugs were not used in Tanzania, East Africa and in the Republic of the Gambia, West Africa, following children during the period when they are most susceptible to falciparum malaria. In both cases parasite counts were significantly lower in G6PD-deficient persons <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> with normal red cell enzymes. The association has also been studied in individuals, which is possible because the enzyme deficiency is sex-linked and female heterozygotes are mosaics due to lyonization, where random inactivation of an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD deficient red blood cells coexisting with normal red blood cells. Malaria parasites were significantly more often observed in normal red cells than in enzyme-deficient cells. An evolutionary genetic analysis of malarial selection of G6PD deficiency genes has been published by Tishkoff and Verelli. The enzyme deficiency is common in many countries that are, or were formerly, malarious, but not elsewhere.|$|E
