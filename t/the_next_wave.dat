5|$|Because of {{the coral}} reef, {{conventional}} landing craft {{could not be}} used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24M8 4.5-inch rockets. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45minutes until the LVTs returned with <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>wave.</b> Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami, the LVTs made 16trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.|$|E

During the morning of March 10, North Vietnamese infantry units attacked Ban Me Thuot from different directions along the main roads. The 174th Regiment, with one armoured battalion in support, marched through Chi Lang, Chu Di, and Mai Hac De from the northwest.

25|$|The {{situation}} for the Ingrian Finns deteriorated further when {{in the fall of}} 1934 the Forbidden Border Zone along the western border of the Soviet Union was established, where entrance was forbidden without special permission issued by the NKVD. It was officially only 7.5km deep initially, but along the Estonian border it extended to as much as 90km. The zone was to be free of Finnic and some other peoples, who were considered politically unreliable. On 25 March 1935, Genrikh Yagoda authorized a large-scale deportation targeting Estonian, Latvian and Finnish kulaks and lishentsy residing in the border regions near Leningrad. About 7,000 people (2,000 families) were deported from Ingria to Kazakhstan, Central Asia and the Ural region. In May and June 1936 the entire Finnish population of the parishes of Valkeasaari, Lempaala, Vuole and Miikkulainen near the Finnish border, 20,000 people, were resettled to the areas around Cherepovets and Siberia in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>wave</b> of deportations.

25|$|Despite {{modern and}} foreign {{influences}} in Mexico’s {{culture in the}} 19th and 20th centuries, waves of nationalism have kept much of the country’s folk dance tradition alive to the present day. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>wave</b> of popularity came after the Mexican Revolution, which also created new songs in folk styles such as the still popular La Adelita, La Valentina, and La Cucaracha. The years after the Revolution also sparked interest in Mexico’s indigenous heritage shifting away from the European emphasis of the Porfirian era. This was reinforced by the muralists and other artists of the 1920s and 1930s whose political aims were to forge a Mexican identity, rejecting foreign influences and politics. In the 1930s, {{the popularity of the}} dance prompted education and more formal training in it, with educational centers all over Mexico offering classes including the Departamento de Bellas Arts (Fine Arts Department) of Mexico City. Interest in folk dance declined in the 1950s and 1960s, but the Mexican government continued to subsidize it for its aesthetic and social value. This included the support of folk dance or ballet folklórico companies, the most famous of which is the Ballet Folklórico de México founded by Amalia Hernández in 1952.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, on the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, the South Vietnamese inside Lộc Ninh were slightly reinforced by the 3rd Battalion, ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment, along with the men of the 1st Cavalry Squadron at FSB Alpha who had refused to surrender.

With the situation critical, the Australians launched a counter-attack. As a part of this attack, Private Bruce Kingsbury charged the Japanese, firing his Bren light machine gun from the hip, killing at least 30 of them and forcing others to withdraw.
