5|$|More {{is known}} about the role of Athenian {{children}} in religion than about any other aspect of their lives, and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have played a prominent role in religious ceremonies. Girls made offerings to Artemis on the eve of their marriage, during pregnancy, and at childbirth. Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive mimicry {{occurs when}} {{the actions of the}} dupe {{directly}} aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> offer. Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, and brood parasitism, which can also involve aggressive mimicry.|$|E

Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E

5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia {{over the issue of}} whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E

5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E

5|$|After a one-month {{hospital}} stay, Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{was promoted}} to Major and made Geschwaderkommodore of Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG5) on 20 February 1944. He and his crew, Oberfeldwebel Josef Renette and Unteroffizier Kurt Röber, {{were killed in a}} flying accident on 12 March 1944 on a routine flight from Parchim to Athies-sous-Laon. Above Belgium, <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have encountered a bad weather zone with low clouds and a dense snowstorm and it was assumed that the aircraft hit the high Ardennes ground after being forced to fly lower because of ice forming on the wings. The exact circumstances of this flight may never be known, the Bf 110 G-4 C9+CD (Werknummer 720 010—factory number) crashed into the Ardennes mountains near St. Hubert where the completely burned-out wreck was found the following day. The funeral service was held in the city church of Linz on 15 March 1944. Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Weißenfeld and Prinz Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein are buried side by side at Ysselsteyn in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E

5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{cathedral chapter}} was {{composed}} of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of Christ Church Cathedral. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was {{the responsibility of the}} prior. At the time of Theobald's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have expected that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to St Martin's Priory at Dover, which had been settled with canons instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near Lewes to provide benefices for his cathedral chapter.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully {{address the question of}} how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E
