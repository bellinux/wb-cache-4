25|$|Within 50 {{years of}} the {{beginnings}} of commercial manufacture in the 1830s, British stained glass grew into an enormous and specialised industry, with important centres in Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, Whitechapel in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Norwich and Dublin. The industry also flourished in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. By 1900 British windows had been installed in Copenhagen, Venice, Athens, Bangalore, Nagasaki, Manila and Wellington.

Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council {{called on the}} government <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>radically</b> how local services are funded and provided. It is claimed government cuts to local authorities have hit Birmingham disproportionately. Child protection services within Birmingham were rated [...] "inadequate" [...] by OFSTED for four years running between 2009 and 2013, with 20 child deaths since 2007 being investigated. In March 2014 the government announced that independent commissioner would be appointed to oversee improvements to children's services within the city.|$|E

[...] Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Smith stated, [...] "It was a really tough shoot.

5000|$|France's {{decision}} to seek reintegration with the NATO military hierarchy caused all the allies {{to evaluate the}} potential ramifications.

Sarkozy determined that the time was ripe <b>to</b> <b>change</b> course <b>radically,</b> and the French Parliament backed this decision with a vote of confidence. In time, the NATO allies will adjust fully to this new reality, but this NATO summit was only a beginning in that uncertain process of reconciliation.|$|R

50|$|The Holy See {{could change}} its {{official}} language fromLatin. The chances {{of that happening}} are remote since the fact that Latin {{is no longer in}} common use makes the meaning of its words less likely <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>radically</b> from century to century.

As a result of a complicated process of mythologizing and counter-mythologizing, it is argued, representations of these combatants can be seen <b>to</b> have <b>changed</b> <b>radically</b> over the years, allowing them to progress from being social outcasts reviled in France to prominent, though often no less reviled, stars of the mainstream...|$|R

The human association which in fact produces and distributes wealth, the association of workmen, managers, technicians and directors is not an association recognised by law. The association which the law does recognise - the association of shareholders, creditors and directors - is incapable of producing and distributing and is not expected to perform these functions. We have to give law to the real association and withdraw meaningless privilege from the imaginary one." ...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1980s, the {{situation}} began <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>radically,</b> {{with a wave}} of nostalgia for 1960s soul music. There were flourishing soul scenes in major cities like London and Manchester, often with many black artists, supported by local and pirate radio stations, but most acts were unable to break out into the national consciousness. Britain's post-disco sound contributed some new black artists to the emerging Contemporary R&B sound, originating in the U.S. (by artists such as Imagination): also of note were Junior, whose major hit [...] "Mama Used to Say" [...] made him the first black British act to appear on Soul Train, Linx, Freeez and Central Line. [...] Increased interest in soul was reflected and fuelled by a series of covers and songs inspired by soul for a number of major acts, including Phil Collins's [...] "You Can't Hurry Love" [...] (1982), Culture Club's [...] "Church of the Poison Mind" [...] (1983), the Style Council's [...] "Speak Like a Child" [...] (1983), Eurythmics' [...] "Missionary Man" [...] (1986), and Steve Winwood [...] "Roll With It" [...] (1988).|$|E
