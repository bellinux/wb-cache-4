5|$|In Florida, the {{depression}} produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at 51mph (82km/h) in Naples. As in Cuba, the system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 25inches (635mm) at Arcadia Tower. Large {{portions of the}} state reported totals in excess of 10inches (255mm) from {{the depression}}, with much of Sarasota County receiving over 20inches (510mm) of rain. The rainfall was classified as a 100-year flood in Sarasota and Manatee counties, where flooding reached 6feet (1.8m) deep in some locations. Officials in Manatee County {{declared a state of}} emergency in response to <b>the</b> <b>flooding.</b> There, about 3,000people were forced to evacuate their homes due to <b>the</b> <b>flooding,</b> some of whom left by boat. <b>The</b> <b>flooding</b> damaged about 50houses in and around Oneco. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported. The reservoir in Manatee County rose to over 39feet (11.9m), 4feet (1.2m) above normal, which resulted in officials opening floodgates to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|In Sarasota County, <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> closed several {{roads and}} led to many overflown creeks and rivers, {{including}} the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while driving along a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with <b>the</b> <b>flooding.</b> Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by <b>the</b> <b>flooding</b> and an additional 70destroyed.

40|$|Flood {{spreading}} {{is one of}} the suitable {{methods to}} control <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> and conservation of soil and water in arid and semi-arid regions. Since soil properties may be influenced by <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> spreading, this study was carried out to investigate the effect of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> spreading on physicochemical soil properties in Garacharyan plain located in North West of Zanjan in 2009. Three flooded areas and one control area were selected for soil sampling. Two hundred sixteen soil samples and twenty seven soil samples were taken from three flooded areas and control area, respectively. Soil infiltrability was also measured at three points both in <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> areas and in control area. Results of the physical soil properties indicated that the soil infiltrability and available water content were significantly (p< 0. 001) affected by <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> spreading in <b>the</b> study plains. With a decrease in sand percentage and an increase in clay in <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> areas, soil infiltrability strongly declined. The available water content negatively correlated (p< 0. 001) with clay in the areas. Soil chemical properties, including salinity, potassium, and bicarbonate, contrary to pH and total neutralizing carbonates and nitrogen, significantly (p< 0. 001) increased in <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> areas as compared with control area. Increasing of the salinity in <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> plains is associated with potassium in <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> plains (p< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} organic matter and carbonate contents between <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> areas and control area. The study revealed that controlling suspended load and solvent solids in <b>the</b> <b>floods</b> is necessary to prevent the degradation of the soil physicochemical properties (porosity, infiltration, plant water supply, and salinity and bicarbonate) and as a result improve the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> spreading method in <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> areas...|$|R
