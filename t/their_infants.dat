40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: Mothers with {{premature}} infants face certain challenges such as uncertainty {{on how to}} {{deal with}} <b>their</b> <b>infant's</b> condition and care for it after discharge from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: A qualitative design was used to explain mothers' challenges after <b>their</b> <b>infant's</b> discharge from NICUs in Isfahan, Iran, 2015. Purposive sampling was adopted to interview the mothers who could provide us information about the challenges after <b>their</b> <b>infant's</b> discharge. Data collection was performed by interviewing mothers. Data saturation was reached after conducting 23 in-depth, semi-structured interviews. All the data was analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Results: Four themes and nine categories were identified. The themes were incompetence in breastfeeding, dependence on hospital and nurses, feeding tube as a reason for stress, and constantly worried mothers. Conclusion: Mothers have difficulty in meeting their infants' basic needs after discharge. Supporting these mothers can enable them promote <b>their</b> <b>infant's</b> health...|$|R
5|$|Unlike other diurnal primates, {{which usually}} carry <b>their</b> <b>infants</b> with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing {{them in the}} canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and {{performs}} other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them {{one at a time}} by grasping the infant's belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too heavy to carry.|$|E
25|$|Mothers {{with one}} or more {{immature}} daughters in addition to <b>their</b> <b>infants</b> are in contact with <b>their</b> <b>infants</b> less than those with no older immature daughters, because the mothers may pass the parenting responsibilities to their daughters. High-ranking mothers with older immature daughters also reject <b>their</b> <b>infants</b> significantly more than those without older daughters, and tend to begin mating earlier in the mating season than expected based on their dates of parturition the preceding birth season. Infants farther {{from the center of the}} groups are more vulnerable to infanticide from outside groups. Some mothers abuse <b>their</b> <b>infants,</b> which is believed to be the result of controlling parenting styles.|$|E

25|$|Pressure from father's rights groups, among others, have {{in several}} {{countries}} resulted in gender-neutral program(s) eligible for parental leave. While historically, maternity benefits were given to mothers based on the physical biology of childbirth, including {{the need to protect}} the health and financial well-being of the woman and child, parental leave benefits emphasize gender-neutral child-rearing, the benefits of the participation of fathers in children's care, and redress discrimination against men who wish to be involved with <b>their</b> <b>infants.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and {{location}} are reported factors of delayed breastfeeding and infant under nutrition. Low- income mothers are specifically {{at risk for}} under nutrition and high mortality rates amongst <b>their</b> <b>infants</b> because they replace breast milk with formula. They {{do so because they}} lack a supportive environment, embarrassment of nursing, or the need to return to school or work. About 16.5% of low-income mothers breastfed for the recommended time. Studies suggest that scarce financial and social resources are consistent with the high mortality rates amongst the infants of low-income mothers.|$|E
25|$|In the Egyptian, Greek and Roman empires, women usually fed {{only their}} own children. However, {{breastfeeding}} {{began to be}} seen as something too common to be done by royalty, and wet nurses were employed to breastfeed the children of the royal families. This extended over time, particularly in western Europe, where noble women often made use of wet nurses. Lower-class women breastfed <b>their</b> <b>infants</b> and used a wet nurse only if they were unable to feed their own infant. Attempts were made in 15th-century Europe to use cow or goat milk, but these attempts were not successful. In the 18th century, flour or cereal mixed with broth were introduced as substitutes for breastfeeding, but this was also unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{illuminate}} the lived experience of women facing {{the threat of}} lossing their newborn child and then experiencing the reality of <b>their</b> <b>infant's</b> death. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen women were interviewed approximately 2 years {{after the death of}} <b>their</b> <b>infant</b> using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. FINDINGS: The main theme was ambivalent transition into motherhood. The women went through the whole life-span of <b>their</b> <b>infant</b> during a very short time. The women's narratives were interpreted as broken expectations, total confusion, reality awareness, consciously leave-taking, and elusive grief. CONCLUSIONS: Women need the opportunity to evolve their own patterns and rhythms in the ambivalent transition from expected motherhood to experiencing neonatal dying and death. Knowledge about the individuality of this process may assist nurses in improving the quality of care...|$|R

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} found to be greater for adult mothers than for adolescent mothers. The level and quality of mind-mindedness, which refers to how prone the mother is to comment about the infant's mental activity during interaction, is higher in adult mothers, and has been related to greater maternal sensitivity. The comments made by adult mothers were found to be more positive than those made by adolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers used almost no positive comments, but instead negative comments. This causes the adolescent mother to be more insensitive to their baby's needs, possibly because of lack of need understanding, and therefore have lower maternal sensitivity and a less secure attachment to <b>their</b> <b>infants.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} risk of major birth defects in antidepressant-exposed pregnancies found a small increase (3% to 24%) in the risk of major malformations and a risk of cardiovascular birth defects that did not differ from non-exposed pregnancies. A study of fluoxetine-exposed pregnancies found a 12% increase in the risk of major malformations that just missed statistical significance. Other studies have found an increased risk of cardiovascular birth defects among depressed mothers not undergoing SSRI treatment, suggesting the possibility of ascertainment bias, e.g. that worried mothers may pursue more aggressive testing of <b>their</b> <b>infants.</b> Another study found no increase in cardiovascular birth defects and a 27% increased risk of major malformations in SSRI exposed pregnancies. The FDA advises for the risk of birth defects with the use of paroxetine and the MAOI should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|According to a US panel, {{attacks on}} Bahá'ís in Iran have {{increased}} since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president. In {{the ten years}} following the 1979 revolution, more than 200 Baha'is were killed or executed, hundreds more were tortured or imprisoned, {{and tens of thousands}} lost jobs, access to education, and other rights – all solely because of their religious belief. Since 2005, more than 710 Baha'is have been arrested, and the number of Baha'is in prison has risen from fewer than five to a current figure of 136; roughly 600 more are engaged with the penal system: awaiting trial, for example, or awaiting sentencing. The incarcerated now include young mothers of nursing children (imprisoned with <b>their</b> <b>infants).</b> Since the summer of 2013, escalation of attacks has included both murder and attempted murder. These attacks are believed to be hate crimes that are religiously motivated.|$|E
