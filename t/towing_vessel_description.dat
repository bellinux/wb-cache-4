40|$|To {{the casual}} observer, <b>towing</b> <b>vessels</b> and barges, with their low profile and unassuming presence, {{may seem to}} be an uninspiring and small part of the {{shipping}} scene. However, tank and dry cargo barges actually carry sixty-nine percent of our nation 2 ̆ 7 s domestic waterborne commerce. Regulations for large ships, especially oil tankers, have touched every aspect of the shipping industry, including naval architecture, engineering, damage control, manning, training, licensing, etc. <b>Towing</b> <b>vessels</b> and barges however, have largely managed to escape the proliferation of regulation. Current legislation does not provide for the inspection of sea-going <b>towing</b> <b>vessels</b> under three hundred gross tons or any inland <b>towing</b> <b>vessels.</b> This research will begin by examining the need for such legislation. The magnitude of the safety problems that plague the towing industry will be illustrated with commerce and casualty statistics, as well as descriptions of actual incidents that demonstrate how the lack of regulation has contributed to many disasters. Next, previous attempts to regulate the towing industry will be examined. Finally, changes in <b>towing</b> <b>vessel</b> equipment, tank barges, manning, and licensing will be proposed...|$|R

40|$|Legislation {{proposed}} {{by members of}} the 103 rd Congress to address <b>towing</b> <b>vessel</b> safety resulted from three focusing events. The proposed legislation was not passed. There is a continuing need to address the human element in marine casualties. Prevention through enforcement is a viable solution to some human causal factors. Numerous personnel investigations which should have been initiated following <b>towing</b> <b>vessel</b> groundings during 1992 and 1993, were not pursued; despite a presumption of negligence that exists in grounding cases. Due to the presumption, all groundings, and particularly those attributed to human factors during a casualty investigation provide sufficient reason to initiate a personnel investigation to ascertain if the casualty is attributable to the operator 2 ̆ 7 s action or inaction. Initiating personnel investigations is necessary to establish whether remedial action is justified. Failure to initiate remedial action against a negligent <b>towing</b> <b>vessel</b> operator 2 ̆ 7 s license following a grounding allows the individual to continue operating under the authority of a license. When remedial action is not pursued, similar casualties could reoccur. Therefore, the Coast guard has foregone a prime opportunity; to preclude similar casualties from recurring; and, ultimately improve <b>towing</b> <b>vessel</b> safety...|$|R

The efficiency of the proposed controller is investigated through extensive simulations of three types of vessels, viz. a barge, a mariner and a tanker.
