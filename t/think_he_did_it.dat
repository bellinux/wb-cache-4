2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E

Snecker had burning holes for eyes in his white face. At the last he was staunch, defiant, game to the core. He didn't think. But Blome faced death and knew it. It was infinitely more than the facing of foes, the taking of stock, preliminary to the even break. Blome's attitude was that of a trapped wolf about to start into savage action; nevertheless, equally it was the pitifully weak stand of a ruffian against ruthless and powerful law.|$|E

Set along the banks of the murky Wishkah River, the strangely appealing little park features a guitar sculpture, a likeness of Cobain with the lyrics to “Something in the Way,” a headstone with some amusing Cobain quotes (sample: “I’m a walking bacterial infection”), a Kurt Cobain “air guitar” sculpture and a collage of Nirvana-related graffiti under the bridge itself.

5000|$|Some reports at {{the time}} {{suggested}} Goodman was angered that Cadence, the new Marvel owners, had reneged on a promise to keep his son, Charles [...] "Chip" [...] Goodman, as Marvel's editorial director. Marvel and Atlas writer Gary Friedrich recalled: [...] "I never really felt that Martin did it for that reason. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> to make money and that he thought with Larry in charge and paying good rates {{that he could do}} it. Now, he probably wouldn't have minded if it would have taken a bite out of Marvel's profits, but I don't think it was done out of revenge. I think Martin was too smart for that". Marvel art director John Romita, however, believed, [...] "Chip was supposed to take his place. But that part of it must not have been on paper, because as soon as Martin was gone, they got rid of Chip. That's why Martin started Atlas Comics. It was pure revenge".|$|E

50|$|Investigating {{the source}} of the music tune and the folktale, the search leads Marcus to a story from a book written by Amanda Righetti (Giuliana Calandra), titled House of the Screaming Child which {{describes}} a long-forgotten murder. Marcus tries to find Amanda {{to talk to her about}} her book, but the unseen killer arrives at her villa first and kills her by drowning her in a bathtub filled with scalding hot water. The dying Righetti manages to write a message on the wall of the steam-filled bathroom before expiring. Marcus then finds the body but afraid that the police will <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> and leaves the place without calling anyone. Thanks to a picture from the book, Marcus locates the house where the folktale originated and learns from the caretaker that no one has lived in the house since 1963 when the previous owner disappeared. Marcus looks around the house, removing plaster from a wall that uncovers a child's drawing of a little boy holding a bloody knife next to a murdered man and a Christmas tree. Only after he leaves the room, more plaster suddenly falls off, revealing a third figure in the drawing.|$|E
50|$|Johnny Brett (Fred Astaire) and King Shaw (George Murphy) are a dance team so down {{on their}} luck they're working in a dance hall for no money. Meanwhile, Clare Bennett (Eleanor Powell) is a big Broadway star. Owing to a case of mistaken identity, Shaw is offered {{the chance to be}} Clare's dancing partner in a new Broadway show, while it was really Johnny's dancing that {{producer}} Bob Casey (Frank Morgan) saw and wanted. The partnership breaks up, but Johnny sticks around to help out Shaw, who lets his newfound success go to his head. Clare eventually realizes that Johnny, and not Shaw, is the better dancer, and she falls in love after having lunch with him. When Shaw gets drunk on opening night, Johnny steps in and saves the show with a brilliant performance, though he lets King <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> himself. Clare later tells Shaw the truth. Just before the next show, Clare discovers Shaw drunk and Johnny becomes the permanent replacement. After the show, they find out that King was pretending to be drunk so that Johnny would get the job.|$|E

Actually, Its a very simple song. In it I showed that sometimes the simplest is the best. Somewhere between a ballad and a lullaby. For the Hit meseca of the Month show everybody used to choose a song with which they would be represented. We chose [...] "Zažmuri". If someone asks you: What should a song for Hit meseca be like, the answer is: Fast and with a hit potential. Thats why the guys from PGP-RTB label went mad: Are you crazy, why didnt you send one of the fast ones? But it happened that the guys from Hit meseca liked it. They gave us a great budget and two days to record a video, which was amazing. The videos were usually recorded for three hours... And we made the dummest possible video. Me, with a dog, on the snow... And then were hugging in some apartment. Totally crazy. All together, it {{was a piece of}} shit. Thats what the director of the video, Milutin Petrović said later, so I can say it now. It was that bad that they played it on one show, on the second, and for the third one they called us to perform live, they didnt want to play the video, it was that awful. Before that, someone from Bijelo Dugme, I cant remember if it was Ipe Ivandić or Zoran Redžić, said to us: It isnt easy to go with the ballad first.
