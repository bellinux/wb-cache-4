Staveley Chemicals were producing chlorine and sodium hydroxide by electrolysing brine, {{and the water}} discharged from the site contained significant quantities of mercury and ammonia. Mercury in particular is highly toxic to fish even in small concentrations, and in 1987, the works was discharging around [...] per year into the river. The works, which {{was taken over by}} Rhône-Poulenc Chemicals, was fitted with a mercury recovery plant, and now virtually no mercury is discharged. The Coalite site was manufacturing chemicals from the liquors produced as a by-product of the adjacent coking plant, and was discharging chlorinated compounds into the river. These were treated as part of a scheme to improve the discharges from <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Zollverein Industrial Complex is the city's {{most famous}} landmark. For decades, the coal mine (current form mainly from 1932, closed in 1986) and <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> (closed in 1993) {{ranked among the}} largest of their kinds in Europe. Shaft XII, built in Bauhaus style, with its {{characteristic}} winding tower, which {{over the years has}} become a symbol for the whole Ruhr area, is considered an architectural and technical masterpiece, earning it a reputation as the [...] "most beautiful coal mine in the world". After UNESCO had declared it a World Heritage Site in 2001, the complex, which had lain idle {{for a long time and}} was even threatened to be demolished, began to see a period of redevelopment. Under the direction of an agency borne by the land of North Rhine-Westphalia and the city itself, several arts and design institutions settled mainly on the grounds of the former coal mine; a redevelopment plan for <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> is to be realised.|$|E
50|$|Bombing {{practically}} ended {{production at}} the plant by 1945. (see also Bombing of Bremen in World War II.) As part of war reparations the vanadium plant was shipped to France. The blast furnaces were demolised in 1949, whilst <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> was retained, due to its necessity in supplying Bremen with gas. The cement plant was also retained for rebuilding work, supplied with bricks from destroyed buildings.|$|E
50|$|After it {{had been}} closed down in 1993, <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> was planned {{to be sold to}} China. The {{negotiations}} failed and it was subsequently threatened to be demolished. However, another project of the state of NRW set the coal mine on a list of future exhibition sites resulting in first gentle modifications and the cokery also became an official heritage site in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The post-war {{period was}} very {{difficult}} for West Cumberland, but Lowca was something of an exception in that the United Coke and Chemicals Company by-products plant was built there in 1923 to refine tars produced by <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> in <b>the</b> Workington area, as well as the coke ovens in Lowca itself. Many photos of traffic on the line right up to closure include tar wagons which would typically travel up to Lowca loaded. The plant finally closed in 1978, five years after the LLR.|$|R

50|$|Shaft 12 thus {{became the}} main {{supplier}} of <b>the</b> new central <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> from 1961 with its 192 ovens, which was again designed by Fritz Schupp. After an {{expansion in the}} early 1970s, Zollverein placed among <b>the</b> most productive <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> worldwide with around 1.000 workers and an output of up to 8.600 tons of coke {{a day on the}} so-called dark side. The white side of the plant produced side products such as ammonia, raw benzene and raw tar.|$|R
50|$|When it closed, Zollverein was {{the last}} {{remaining}} active coal mine in Essen. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> remained open until June 30, 1993, mining activities in shaft 12 stopped on December 23, 1986. Although it is the central shaft of the Cultural Heritage site, shaft 12 cannot be visited as it continues being used as the water drainage for the central Ruhr area together with shaft 2.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> {{closed in}} 1991. In 1995 British Coal Opencast was {{authorised}} {{to remove the}} spoil tip of the former colliery and conduct opencast coal mining on a site totalling 700 acre. BCO removed some 12 million tonnes of spoil, extracted coal from it, and also realigned almost 3/4 mi of the River Rother. In 2005 BCO completed its work at Orgreave and handed over the land for redevelopment.|$|E
50|$|In the 1984-85 Miners' Strike, National Union of Mineworkers members picketed <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> {{to prevent}} {{employees}} and coal from entering or products from leaving. On 18 June 1984, {{three and a}} half months into the strike, a large number of South Yorkshire Police officers, including mounted units, were deployed against the pickets. There was large-scale violence between police and pickets, which became known as the Battle of Orgreave.|$|E
50|$|Coal mining in {{the area}} began with Dore House Colliery in 1820. The first shaft of Orgreave Colliery was sunk in 1851. In the 20th century <b>the</b> Orgreave <b>Coking</b> <b>Plant</b> was established, and the {{colliery}} began to supply the plant. The National Coal Board closed Orgreave Colliery in 1981.|$|R

Take a stroll and feel the inspiration of Ostrava’s proud industrial past.|$|R
25|$|Water {{quality was}} also {{affected}} by four <b>coking</b> <b>plants,</b> at Orgreave, Brookhouse, Avenue and Coalite. Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia {{content and the}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146mg/l of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70 per cent lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since. Discharges from Avenue <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, {{to enable them to}} be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. <b>The</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plants</b> were <b>the</b> worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|R
50|$|At {{nationalisation}} {{the mining}} and coking operations were split, the coal processing and chemicals interests stayed with United Steel Companies under their subsidiary, the United Coke & Chemical Company. The collieries at Orgreave and Treeton were linked underground {{and as well}} as <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> the coal drawn by these collieries was fed to the washery at Orgreave Coal Preparation Plant. Orgreave colliery closed in October 1981, the coking ovens in 1990.|$|E
50|$|On {{the grounds}} of the coal mine and <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant,</b> which are both {{accessible}} free of charge while paid guided tours (some with former Kumpels) are also available, several tourist attractions can be found, most importantly the Design Zentrum NRW/Red Dot Design Museum. The Ruhrmuseum, a museum dedicated to the history of the Ruhr area, which had been existing since 1904, opened its gates as one of the anchor attractions in the former coal-washing facility in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Despite having claimed {{reserves}} {{equivalent to}} 60 years, by 1980 geological problems had restricted production to coming {{only from the}} Meadow Vein underneath Machen, and Big Vein. Most of this coal was transported by rail along the former Rumney Railway to the British Steel Corporation steel mill in Llanwern, while the residual was sent to <b>the</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> at Trethomas, adjacent to the colliery site, which had been leased to the British Benzol and Coal Distillation Co.

50|$|Despite the {{pollution}} {{of the lower}} river, the upper reaches retained a population of fish. Brown trout were present around Stainsby, and there were small numbers of coarse fish, which had originated in the lakes at Hardwick Hall. They could not exist further down river, because of {{the pollution}}. Part {{of the problem was}} caused by efforts to reduce air pollution, which resulted in the production of smokeless fuels. While this reduced smoke from domestic fires, the liquors which were removed from the coal were highly toxic and rich in ammonia. <b>The</b> <b>coking</b> <b>plant</b> at Bolsover run by Coalite Chemicals was a significant producer of pollution, and the site was also producing chlorinated compounds by distilling the liquors resulting from the coking process, which added to the toxic mix.
