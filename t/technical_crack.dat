This paper contributes to the feasible fatigue levels of disc laser welded joints made of 20 MnCr 5 and GJS 620 using different process parameters. The fatigue behaviour of similar joints made of 20 MnCr 5 was also studied for two different contact conditions. The influence of the heterogeneous start and stop pilot region of the laser beam to fatigue life is also discussed. Accompanying fracture analysis detected the spot of <b>technical</b> <b>crack</b> initiation at the most stressed root surface. A high process quality for the laser welded joints was confirmed by examining both metallographic sections and the surface topography. Structural weld simulation work was performed to elucidate the local differences between the continuous seam and the overlapping laser weld pilot regions. Investigations showed that the notch stress approach with an effective radius of 0. 05 mm lead to S/N-curves which generally matched the standard recommendations regarding fatigue...|$|E
40|$|The proper {{consideration}} of variable amplitude loading by utilizing service spectra and appropriate Gassner-lines {{is essential for}} the design of light-weight components and structures by allowing loads in significant excess of the Woehler-line (S-N curve). This permits higher stresses than under constant amplitude loading and renders reduced component dimensions. Reliable reconstitution and simulation methods for service load-time histories require not only the rainflow matrices, but also information about te order of the cycles described by Markovian matrices, the power spectral density and, for multiaxial applications, the corss-correlations between the particular load directions as well as the phase relations. A major problem in numerical fatigue life assessment is still the fatigue life calculations for spectrum loading. These findings demonstrate the need for experimental spectrum tests, which are indispensable for ensuring the safety of parts. With regard to safety and liability requirements, the failure probability resulting from the probability of occurrence of the spectrum, from the scattering of the fatigue strength and from the failure criterion (<b>technical</b> <b>crack</b> or propagation), must be taken into account...|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of the investigations {{presented in this paper}} is the simplified consideration of mean and residual stresses as well as the complete disregard of the complex failure mechanisms in the common fatigue standards and guidelines. An improved fatigue life assessment for welded components, which includes the crack initiation and propagation phase is the scope of this paper. The crack initiation phase is considered using the strain-life approach. The crack propagation life, starting from a <b>technical</b> <b>crack</b> of a depth of a = 0. 5 mm, is derived by the application of linear-elastic fracture mechanics. In this two-phase approach, the mean and residual stresses are considered by using damage parameters for the initiation phase and effective stress intensity factors for the propagation phase. With this approach, a better understanding can be obtained of the influence of mean- and residual stresses and their influence on the course (slope k and knee point Nk) of the S-N curve. With this information to hand, a more reliable fatigue assessment can be achieved than is possible with the common standards and guidelines. With the proposed two-phase approach, higher permissible stresses can be allowed in the design phase, leading to resource-efficient, lightweight constructions...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental activity {{proved that}} the fatigue life of bonded joints in composite materials {{can be divided into}} two distinct phases: an initiation or nucleation phase followed by the crack growth up to a critical length. The fraction of the life spent in the two phases depends on many parameters like joint geometry, stress distributions, stress ratio, adhesive type and thickness, environmental conditions and others. The fatigue cracks nucleate and grow mainly in the adhesive or at the adhesive/adherent interface. It is in the authors’ opinion that {{the most efficient way to}} model the fatigue behaviour and assess the fatigue life of these bonded connections is to account for the actual evolution of the damage and a model was developed accordingly. The first part of the fatigue life, up to the initiation of a <b>technical</b> <b>crack</b> (about 0. 3 mm), is estimated using a generalised stress intensity factor approach. The duration of the propagation phase is later assessed by integrating a suitable power law relating the crack growth rate to the maximum strain energy release rate. This work deals with the first part of the model and presents the results of several numerical two-dimensional analyses carried out with the aim to investigate the stress fields in bonded composite joints, to evaluate the static strength and the crack onset under cyclic fatigue loading. The generalised stress intensity factors for the different joint geometries were evaluated by means of geometrically linear analysis on uncracked 2 D FE models...|$|E
40|$|The industrially used fatigue {{strength}} assessment concepts basing on nominal and/or structural stresses cannot consider and describe {{in detail the}} local stress-strain state in the root of a weld. To some extent they {{take account of the}} local geometry of a welded joint by assigning a detail category, but they do not relate to the local values responsible for crack initiation and propagation. Therefore, the application of appropriate local approaches promise a more precise description of the fatigue behaviour of welded joints. For welded joints of steel different local approach variants were applied with more or less success and further investigations are still focusing on this subject. Thus, few knowledge is available for the application of local approaches on welded joints of aluminium especially {{for a wide range of}} stress concentration factors. Therefore in the present paper, the existing local approaches are verified respect by the example of the AlMg 4. 5 Mn W 28 aluminium alloy (EN-AW 5083, AA 5083). The fatigue behaviour of aluminium welded joints with a wide stress-concentration range (Kt = 1. 4 to 15. 2) was investigated. The cyclic material properties of parent (base) material and weld metal (deposite) in unnotched (Kt = 1. 0) and notched states (Kt = 2. 5 to 12. 9) were generated in order to derive strain-and load-controlled S-N curves and micro-support material constants.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the problem of crack {{propagation}} assessment of single lap bonded joints in composite material has been analysed. Experimental tests on carbon fabric-epoxy 1. 6 -mm-thick single lap specimens were conduced in tension-to-tension fatigue. Crack length was monitored {{by means of an}} optical microscope at scheduled number of cycles during each test. Different over lap lengths (20 mm and 40 mm), configurations of corner geometry (square edge or spew fillet) and stacking sequence ([45 / 02]s and [452 / 0]s) were taken into account. Being a scientific definition of the crack initiation and propagation phases beyond our scope, it has been assumed that initiation phase ceases when a <b>technical</b> <b>crack</b> having size equal to 0. 3 mm is observed at the adherend-adhesive interface. Since the tested joint geometry induces combined opening and sliding modes at the crack tip, experimental crack growth rates have been summarized in terms of an equivalent value of the Strain Energy Release Rates (SERR). However, crack monitoring by means of manual optical microscope inspection resulted to be a very time –consuming procedure: then it is proposed to adopt the specimen’s stiffness loss, which is easier to be automatically monitored during the fatigue test, as an indicator of the evolution of cracks’ length. Calibration by means of a so-called master curve enabled us to convert the stiffness values into corresponding crack lengths and finally crack growth rates, which resulted consistent with the experimental ones. The existence of a unique Paris-like curve correlating crack growth rates in terms of SERR, to be used for engineering crack propagation assessments, has been finally checked...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} {{of the remaining}} service life for a conveyor chain is still an important requirement of customers {{which has not been}} solved satisfactorily up to now. The life time sensor developed through the research project “Intelligent Conveyor Chain” constitutes a new approach for long term data logging of chain loads. Fatigue assessment requires the determination of the curve for standing loads and the actual load range. As part of the accumulated damage assessment the damage arising during each individual load cycle is added up. When the total value reaches 1, this indicates a <b>technical</b> <b>crack</b> which will lead to a failure of the structural element of the chain. Determination of the remaining lifetime is based on the recording time of the associated load range data. The longer the recording time during operation the more representative is the load range data and as a result, the fatigue assessment is more reliable. Whereas the Wöhler curves have been determined experimentally {{for a wide range of}} different materials they can alternatively be estimated empirically by taking static strength values. In this case the load range has to be determined based on the original load time function of the structural element, independently from the method of fatigue assessment being used. The automotive and aircraft building industries for example have accumulated a huge amount of reliable load range data based on countless prototype tests. Non-standard manufactured products can not be tested to such a level of complexity. For these types of products the design process is limited to the use of estimated load range data. In the field of Condition Monitoring the customer increasingly demands a fatigue assessment indicating the potential service life of parts. The current market provides many different monitoring systems for measuring the load on parts. Most of these systems have to be connected by wire to the measuring point and as a result they are not appropriate for moving parts. Therefore telemetry systems which use wireless communication between the measuring point and the recording device can be used as an alternative. However the time of recording is mostly restricted by the capacity of the battery due to the high power consumption of these devices. Furthermore the space required for the batteries as well for the antennae is considerable. Such conventional telemetry systems are not suitable for installation directly into a conveyor chain. The newly developed “life time sensor” uses a novel concept which enables, for the first time, the long term data logging of chain loads for a service life of up to 3 years. The extension of service life compared to conventional telemetry has been achieved by miniaturisation of the system and the application of energy efficient components. In addition, by employing a measuring frequency matched to the operating conditions, combined with defined power saving, stand-by modes, the service life of these devices is greatly increased. With an outer diameter of about 25 mm and a length of less than 30 mm, these devices can be fitted directly into a chain conveyor link. Another advantage is the pre-processing of measurement data. Within the “life time sensor” the measured data is classified into matrix form to reduce the memory requirements. The advantage of matrix evaluated data compared to cyclic pitch data based on Rainflow counting or cycle counting Algorithms, is the consideration of the shift in the mean stress. Successful testing of the data logging, measurement data pre-processing and wireless communication has been carried out on various test installations at the company Thiele GmbH. The modified Markov matrix counting and the fatigue assessment of the conveyor chain have been verified on a test stand called “Hydropulser”. When a comparison was made between the chain link damage on the basis of the predetermined load variation and the results based on the measured load variation of the “life time sensor” they were found to match. There is a mismatch between the theoretical and the determined remaining life time due to the type of testing carried out, so that chain damage occurred at a calculated value of 0. 46. A reliable adjustment of the fatigue assessment using the relative form is feasible at a first field test in an underground longwall and not at a test stand in a predefined environment. The results of the research and development carried out in this project, have demonstrated that long term data logging combined with measurement data pre processing is possible. Determination of the actual chain load range and thus the remaining chain life is now available. The “life time sensor” offers a reliable basis for condition monitoring of chain conveyors. Further Research and development will demonstrate the possible use of these devices in other fields of application...|$|E

If more than eight trams are in non-operational condition, HKL has the right to cancel the contract and return the trams to Bombardier, who are obliged to return the €76 million that HKL paid for the trams.

The results of this analysis showthat the DEMaccurately represents these processes in comparison to other studies in the <b>technical</b> literature. The <b>crack</b> propagation and coalescence processes are important in the step-path failure mechanism for slopes. Simple examples of this mechanism were modeled, and their results were compared with those of the analytical model proposed by Jennings (1970). Among the possibilities suggested by Jennings,modelingwith DEMdid not provide a good approximation for the case of coplanar cracks, forwhich failures in the intact rock bridges should only be caused by shear forces. Inmodelingwith DEM, tensile failures occur within the sliding block, generating forces that are not considered in the Jennings model. The non-coplanar crack condition provided a better approximation, since the Jennings model formulation for this case includes the tensile failure of the rock. The main advantage of the DEM over other computational tools is its micromechanical representation of discontinuous media, which permits {{a better understanding of the}} step-path failure mechanism.
