50|$|The {{storage of}} DUF6 {{presents}} environmental, health, and safety risks {{because of its}} chemical instability. When UF6 is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce UO2F2 (uranyl fluoride), a solid, and HF (hydrogen fluoride), a gas, {{both of which are}} highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> the <b>leak,</b> limiting further escape of depleted UF6. Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation. Storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks, and are repainted and repaired as necessary.|$|R

500|$|In 1984, {{the statue}} {{was closed to}} the public for the {{duration}} of the renovation. Workers erected the world's largest free-standing scaffold, which obscured the statue from view. Liquid nitrogen was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades, leaving two layers of coal tar, originally applied <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>leaks</b> and prevent corrosion. Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper. The restorers' work was hampered by the asbestos-based substance that Bartholdi had used—ineffectively, as inspections showed—to prevent galvanic corrosion. Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear, dubbed [...] "moon suits", with self-contained breathing circuits. Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired, and new copper was added where necessary. The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs, which had a patina that closely resembled the statue's; in exchange, the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing. The torch, found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations, was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi's unaltered torch. Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead. The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one, whose flame is covered in 24-carat gold. The torch reflects the sun's rays in daytime and is lighted by floodlights at night.|$|R

40|$|Commentators {{have argued}} that {{employees}} should be compensated {{in the event of}} a hostile takeover; otherwise, the threat of such a takeover will fail to incentivize firm-specific investments by employees. Such deferred compensation is analogous to the payment of damages following a breach of contract. The analogous breach, here, is the breach of an implicit contract between management and employees. Employees trusted management to compensate them for firm-specific investments not explicitly contracted for. This Article uses a familiar result from the contract law literature: There is no measure of damages for breach of contract that can generate both efficient breach and efficient investment by parties to the relationship. While zero damages results in an inefficiently high likelihood of breach, expectation damages result in too much investment. Similarly, in the hostile takeover context, no measure of ex post compensation to employees can generate efficient takeovers from outside bidders and efficient firm-specific investment by employees. Measures of compensation that incentivize only those takeovers that are efficient will lead to overreliance, i. e., excessive firm-specific investments.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{investigates the}} {{perceptions}} of young women during their vocational education and training (VET) in traditionally male-dominated STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—by analyzing mechanisms and actions addressing the female gender in gender-atypical career fields and reveals strategies young women apply when adjusting to the male-dominated educational and professional fields. Design/methodology/approach: The data originate from semi-structured interviews with young women (N = 71) who had chosen a STEM career and who were enrolled in VET in Swiss secondary schools. Results: The results indicate different processes of gendering in VET, uncovering various mechanisms and symbolic actions which contribute to the (re-) production of a masculine culture in STEM professions. Furthermore, the study provides insight into the different strategies young women apply in order to adjust to gender-atypical educational and professional life domains. Implications: The paper calls for the visibility of gender inequality in VET {{in order to make}} changes toward less female dropout in STEM fields. Moreover, the paper also presents implications for HR professionals and practitioners and provides suggestions for debates about the shortage of (female) STEM workers. Originality/value: Little is known about women’s experience in gender-atypical tracks of VET. There is still a need <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> the <b>leaks,</b> i. e., reduce female attrition, in the STEM pipeline...|$|R

50|$|A {{dramatic}} break {{somewhere along}} the length of an 8,750-foot injection well casing resulted in a gigantic methane eruption from the field on October 23, 2015, spewing on the order of 60 million cubic feet of methane per day at first, before the pressure was reduced. The well, Standard Sesnon 25 ("SS 25") had originally been installed in 1953, and reworked as a gas injection well in 1973, but lacked a blowout prevention valve, as it had not been considered a priority given the well's position, at the time, far from a populated area. Fallout from the methane cloud, in the form of oily droplets and persistent noxious odors, caused the evacuation of over 6,000 families, who have relocated to hotels and other rentals at SoCalGas's expense throughout the region. Another 10,000 homes received air-purification systems at the company’s expense. On Dec. 4, 2015, SoCalGas commenced drilling a relief well to stop the natural gas blowout by plugging the damaged well at its base. The relief well intercepted the base of the well on Feb. 11, 2016, and the company began pumping heavy fluids to temporarily control the flow of gas out of the well. SoCalGas was able <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> the <b>leak</b> permanently on February 18, 2016.

Attacks on the enemy was largely concentrated in the vicinity of Cambrai, but the congestion on the roads behind his lines presented opportunities for much greater damage to his morale by attacking trucks and troops on the highway from altitudes of less than a few hundred feet. When flying the low-level attacks, the 17th relied on other squadrons patrolling higher up to look out for the enemy's Fokkers, while the squadron received ground fire from the enemy below.|$|R

In response, there is an increase in investigations and prosecutions and proposed legislation <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> government <b>leaks.</b> But a broader reality may be at work. In the increasingly interconnected and transparent world of the Internet, Facebook, Twitter, satellite television, WikiLeaks, omniscient cellphones and technology-enhanced revolutions such as the Arab Awakening, governments have lost their ability to control the flow of information. More people have access to more information, with the ability to communicate anything from anywhere with the touch of a button. WikiLeaks itself may be a “one-hit wonder,” but given the advance of technology and networking of political actors and professional journalists, this model of networked advocacy and journalism within a 24 / 7 global media environment is sure to be repeated. Governments have a legitimate need to protect confidential conversations that enable effective diplomacy, policymaking and military action to take place. A world without secrets would be dysfunctional. However, there must also be a zone of accountability whereby citizens are properly informed and governments subject to genuine oversight. Technology is expanding transparency, whether governments like it or not. Faced with more competing voices and narratives in a global media environment, governments will need to communicate more and more effectively to ensure policies and actions are viewed as credible and legitimate.

Bullen was placed in charge of the Delft, which he found to have been greatly damaged during the battle and leaking badly. 43 members of her crew had been killed, including the captain, and 76 injured. To add to Bullen's woes, on 14 November, a storm blew up.

Bullen agreed to stay behind and help evacuate the wounded but few could be got off. When the Delft suddenly sank, Heilburg went down with her but Bullen jumped into the sea where he was later rescued.

While CO 2 resistant cements and ultrafine cements are being developed, technologies that can be delivered via low viscosity fluids could have significant advantages including the ability <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> small aperture <b>leaks</b> such as fractures or delamination interfaces. Additionally there is the potential <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> rock formation pore space around the wellbore in particularly problematic situations. We are carrying out research {{on the use of}} microbial biofilms capable of inducing the precipitation of crystalline calcium carbonate using the process of ureolysis. This method has the potential to reduce well bore permeability, coat cement to reduce CO 2 ?related corrosion, and lower the risk of unwanted upward CO 2 migration. In this spotlight, we highlight research currently underway at the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE) at Montana State University (MSU) in the area of ureolytic biomineralization sealing for reducing CO 2 leakage risk. This research program combines two novel core testing systems and a 3 -dimensional simulation model to investigate biomineralization under both radial and axial flow conditions and at temperatures and pressures which permit CO 2 to exist in the supercritical state. This combination of modelling and experimentation is ultimately aimed at developing and verifying biomineralization sealing technologies and strategies which can successfully be applied at the field scale for carbon capture and geological storage (CCGS) projects. ? 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, LtdPeer reviewe...|$|R
