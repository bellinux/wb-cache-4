5|$|After {{the release}} of Magnolia, Anderson stated {{that he would like}} to work with comedic actor Adam Sandler in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> that he was {{determined}} to make his next film a comparatively shorter length of just 90 minutes. The resulting feature was the romantic comedy-drama film Punch-Drunk Love (2002), starring Sandler, with Emily Watson portraying his love interest. The story centers on a beleaguered small-business owner (Sandler) with anger issues and seven emasculating sisters. A subplot in the film was partly based on David Phillips (also called The Pudding Guy). Sandler received critical praise for his role in his first major departure from the mainstream comedies that had made him a star. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.|$|E

5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year.

In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E

The vision of the club and its youth system is not only to produce new players but also to prepare young children for <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> life without football. Therefore, each child {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful not only on the football field, but also in the field of education.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with arbitrage opportunities in <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> <b>and</b> <b>futures</b> option contracts traded on <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Futures</b> Exchange (SFE) within a put-call-futures-parity (PCFP) framework. Tick-by-tick transaction price data are employed so that <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> contracts, <b>the</b> call <b>futures</b> options <b>and</b> <b>the</b> put <b>futures</b> options can be matched within a one-minute interval. This paper also {{takes into account the}} realistic transaction costs that an arbitrager has to incur, including the implicit bid-ask spread. A thorough ex post analysis is first carried out. The results reveal a significant number of violations of the PCFP in the sample. Ex ante tests are then conducted whereby ex post profitable arbitrage strategies, signified by the matched trios of <b>futures,</b> put <b>and</b> call contracts, are executed with lags up to 3  min. The ex ante results are similar to the ex post results. However, further analysis reveals that the exploitability of the identified arbitrage opportunities is very limited due to the small trading volumes of <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> <b>and</b> options contracts. Thus, we conclude that there is no strong evidence against the arbitrage efficiency between <b>the</b> SPI index <b>futures</b> <b>and</b> options markets in Australia.
