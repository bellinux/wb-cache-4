5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E
25|$|Suho {{also stated}} {{that he had never}} thought about the sales numbers after the release of the album, and just wanted to bring new music to fans of the band. He said that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the members' mind whilst making the album was for the {{listeners}} to enjoy it. He also concluded by saying {{that it would be a}} new start for EXO, after the lawsuits of former band members Luhan and Kris, and that the members would show a brighter, fresher side to their fans.|$|E
500|$|Considered by {{many critics}} {{as one of}} Dylan's masterpieces, [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] proved {{difficult}} to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing {{in the fall of}} 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: [...] "This is called 'Freeze Out'." [...] Gill notes that this working title captures the [...] "air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched... full of whispering and muttering." [...] Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to sketch out how he wanted it played, saying at one point, [...] "it's not hard rock, <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.|$|E

5000|$|Siedlecki and his wife, Nancy, {{have three}} children: Kevin, Jackie, and Amy. [...] Siedlecki's wife once told a {{reporter}} {{that her husband had}} an [...] "obsession" [...] with football, and Siedlecki did not disagree. He noted, [...] "I'm basically football and family; those are about <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> my life. I love the game. I love coaching." ...|$|R
500|$|Some of the New York {{recordings}} were uptempo {{and contain}} {{in the fifth}} verse the additional line [...] "He examines the nightingale's code". Historian Sean Wilentz, for his book Dylan In America, listened closely to full studio tapes of the Blonde on Blonde sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] played. At one point, Dylan says: [...] "It's not hard rock, <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> it that's hard is Robbie." [...] Analyzing {{the evolution of the}} song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan [...] "quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on Blonde on Blonde—and it is still not right." [...] Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on [...] in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Several of the episode's {{scenes and}} motifs have been {{compared}} to popular myths and legends. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, equated Mulder's overall quest {{to that of the}} search for the Holy Grail. She notes that in [...] "The Truth", Mulder and Scully metaphorically [...] "find their way to the Grail castle" [...] only to discover that the Fisher King—the wounded knight charged with protecting the secret—is actually The Smoking Man. Furthermore, Bush compared the final scene of the episode—featuring Mulder musing about hope regarding an alien invasion—to the myth of Pandora's Box. According to legend, the ancient Greek gods gave Pandora a box filled with evils and told her not to open it. Due to her curiosity, she disobeyed and unleashed various calamities unto the world. Bush argues that the Syndicate's tampering with alien technology—such as their alien-human hybrid experiments—are similar to the contents of the box. She notes that, in both cases, [...] "man's curiosity is his downfall". In the end, however, both Pandora's box and the world of The X-Files contain hope, which, in the legend, was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the box that Pandora did not let go of.|$|E
500|$|It gave {{two reasons}} for the populist surge across Europe: The [...] "movements tap into a deep discontent with the {{mainstream}} parties in Europe's political systems. Every funding scandal, every politician found to be corrupt, adds more wind to these parties' sails. The European Union, lacking decisive leadership in times of financial difficulty, is an ideal further focus for this ire;" [...] and that populist appeals rely on having [...] "an enemy to hand. This enemy is anyone coming from the outside – immigrants. Anti-immigrant rhetoric is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> common between the politics of these parties. More mainstream politicians such as David Cameron or Angela Merkel then start to adopt this rhetoric. Add to this the hurt inflicted on Europe's populations due to the financial crisis and stagnant growth, and populists have ready material with which to work." [...] It postulated that a solution could lie with a [...] "traditional approach", which the UK-based paper said was most effectively implemented by the group Hope Not Hate, though it only solved {{a part of the}} problem in [...] "exposing the extremes of the populist parties". It added that more mainstream parties {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum need to change as well by ensuring high standards of propriety and ethics and by articulating what it termed [...] "positive and optimistic economic and political solutions" [...] rather than what it said was populist rhetoric.|$|E
60|$|There was {{certainly}} {{too much of}} it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.|$|R

2500|$|Terry Lubbock {{responded by}} {{distancing}} {{himself from the}} controversy saying, [...] "This is a diversion from the campaign which I don't want to take any part in. My aim is as it has always been, to get justice for my son Stuart and that is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> my life now. I'm {{not going to let}} anything distract me from that.

2500|$|In 1934, Furuseth was {{involved}} San Francisco's longshoremen's strike. Furuseth {{had lived in}} San Francisco's Embarcadero for 40 years, and was concerned the strike {{could lead to the}} kind of violence experienced in the recent Auto-Lite and the Minneapolis Teamsters strikes. He unsuccessfully attempted to mediate, pleading [...] "With confidence and justice we can settle this strike within 24 hours and without bloodshed. Men, let's get together while there is still time. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the way of peace now is distrust, one group of the other." [...] The strike led to the unionization of all West Coast ports of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the {{business}} focus of Albert Weber Sr., {{but not his}} energy and zest for life, Weber Jr. was also known {{as something of a}} hothead and even spent a night in jail for assault. [...] This 1896 assault charge, when Weber Jr. was 38 years old, gives some insight into his character, with the magistrate remarking [...] "You had no right to call this man names, and you also had no right to flourish a loaded revolver in that dangerous manner. [...] I fine you $5." [...] Unfortunately for Weber, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> his pockets was a bean shooter, so he spent the night in jail as he failed to produce the necessary $5. [...] This incident occurred at the Weber Company's showrooms on Fifth Avenue in September 1896. [...] Only a few weeks later, Weber had a mental breakdown that required he be taken to Bellevue Hospital's insane pavilion, although this may have been an attempt to escape from his creditors.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of creation, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> existence were Areop-Enap (a spider) and the sea. Areop-Enap searched for food in the darkness and found an enormous clam (in some accounts a Tridacna clam). Before he could stun it, the clam swallowed him and snapped shut again. In the darkness, Areop-Enap explored the clam's insides, and found a tiny snail (or in some accounts, a Triton's Horn shellfish).|$|R

2500|$|At the 1976 US Open, Evert faced {{off against}} Goolagong {{again for the}} second-time in a slam final in 1976. The match was {{basically}} a systematic trouncing by Evert against Goolagong, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> question was a suspect line call that went in Evert's favor, but being a good sport Evert asked the umpire to reassess the call {{and gave it to}} her opponent. From two games to three advantage Goolagong in the first set, Evert took the next ten games off her opponent and took the title and championship. Goolagong could not give any competition to Evert in the final, which she lost {{for the second year in}} a row to Evert, which made Evert's record against her 18 to 11. She would lose only 12 games at this US Open on her way to the title. It is the least amount of games lost by a Grand Slam Champion. Evert would say after this win, which was her second slam title of the year that [...] "this has to be the best year of my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1852, {{when his}} first major novels of Russian society were still to come, Turgenev wrote an {{obituary}} for Nikolai Gogol, intended for publication in the Saint Petersburg Gazette. The key passage reads: [...] "Gogol is dead!... What Russian heart is not shaken by those three words?... He is gone, that man whom {{we now have the}} right (the bitter right, given to us by death) to call great." [...] The censor of Saint Petersburg did not approve of this and banned publication, but the Moscow censor allowed it to be published in a newspaper in that city. The censor was dismissed; but Turgenev was held responsible for the incident, imprisoned for a month, and then exiled to his country estate for nearly two years. [...] It was during this time that Turgenev wrote his short story Mumu ("Муму") in 1854. [...] The story tells a tale of a deaf and dumb peasant who is forced to drown <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the world which brings him happiness, his dog Mumu. [...] Like his A Sportsman's Sketches (Записки охотника), this work takes aim at the cruelties of a serf society. This work was later applauded by John Galsworthy who claimed, [...] "no more stirring protest against tyrannical cruelty was ever penned in terms of art." ...|$|E
