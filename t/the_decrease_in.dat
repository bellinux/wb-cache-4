40|$|PurposeDuring anesthesia, {{maneuvers}} {{which cause}} the least disturbance of cerebral oxygenation with <b>the</b> greatest <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> intracranial pressure {{would be most}} beneficial to patients with intracranial hypertension. Both head-up tilt (HUT) and hyperventilation are used to decrease brain bulk, and both {{may be associated with}} <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> cerebral oxygenation. In this observational study, our null hypothesis was that the impact of HUT and hyperventilation on cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO 2) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) are comparable. MethodsSurgical patients without neurological disease were anesthetized with propofol-remifentanil. Before the start of surgery, frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure SctO 2 and CBV at the supine position, at the 30 ° head-up and head-down positions, as well as during hypoventilation and hyperventilation. ResultsThirty-three patients were studied. Both HUT and hyperventilation induced small <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> SctO 2 [3. 5 (2. 6) %; P < 0. 001 and 3. 0 (1. 8) %; P < 0. 001, respectively] and in CBV [0. 05 (0. 07) mL· 100 g− 1; P < 0. 001 and 0. 06 (0. 05) mL· 100 g− 1; P < 0. 001, respectively]. There were no differences between HUT to 30 ° and hyperventilation to an end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) of 25 mmHg (from 45 mmHg) in both SctO 2 (P = 0. 3) and CBV (P = 0. 4). DiscussionThe small but statistically significant <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> both SctO 2 and CBV caused by HUT and hyperventilation are comparable. There was no correlation between <b>the</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> SctO 2 and CBV and <b>the</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> blood pressure and cardiac output during head-up and head-down tilts. However, <b>the</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> both SctO 2 and CBV correlate with <b>the</b> <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> ETCO 2 during ventilation adjustment...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{consumer}} {{perspectives of}} implemented and proposed gambling harm minimisation measures {{taken from a}} geographically stratified survey of adult residents in Tasmania, Australia. Electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers were asked whether current and proposed EGM harm minimisation measures impacted on their actual or anticipated gambling expenditure and enjoyment. Participants were analysed based on their endorsement of Problem Gambling Severity Index criteria (scores 0 – 27), and categorised as non-problem gamblers (score 0), low-risk gamblers (scores 1 – 2), and moderate/problem gamblers (scores 3 +). Specifically, we wanted to identify harm minimisation policies that resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> enjoyment for non-problem gamblers and <b>the</b> highest <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers. Regarding current policies, <b>the</b> lowest <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was the ban on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in EGM venues (0. 2 %) while <b>the</b> highest <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was the reduction in maximum lines (46. 9 %). For the proposed measures, <b>the</b> lowest <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> enjoyment for non-problem gamblers was visible clocks (1. 2 %) while <b>the</b> highest <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> expenditure for moderate/problem gamblers was reducing cash withdrawals (36. 3 %). These results suggest universal EGM harm minimisation measures can differentially target non-problem and moderate/problem gamblers...|$|R
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of <b>the</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E

This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, <b>the</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the {{exercise}} of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of}} the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year.

Despite <b>the</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E

The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision.

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during <b>the</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E

Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that Windy Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E
