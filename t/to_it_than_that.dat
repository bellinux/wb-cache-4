2500|$|For Alexander {{to marry}} a {{daughter}} of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet there was more <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Alexander, says Arrian [...] "...wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children...".

2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would like to believe. [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E

40|$|Effective norms, {{emerging}} from sustained individual interactions over time, can complement societal rules and significantly enhance performance of individual agents and agent societies. Researchers {{have used a}} model that supports the emergence of social norms via learning from interaction experiences where each interaction {{is viewed as a}} stage game. In this social learning model, which is distinct from an agent learning from repeated interactions against the same player, an agent learns a policy to play the game from repeated interactions with multiple learning agents. The key research question is to characterize when and how the entire population of homogeneous learners converge to a consistent norm when multiple action combinations yield the same optimal payoff. In this paper we study two extensions to the social learning model that significantly enhances its applicability. We first explore the effects of heterogeneous populations where different agents may be using different learning algorithms. We also investigate norm emergence when agent interactions are physically constrained. We consider agents located on a grid where an agent is more likely to interact with other agents situated closer <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> those <b>that</b> are situated afar. The key new results include the surprising acceleration in learning with limited interaction ranges. We also study the effects of pure-strategy players, i. e., nonlearners in the environment...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Applied Language and Literary Studies)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001. Language {{practitioners}} {{the world}} over have been struggling for professional recognition for many years. In many instances the emphasis has been on establishing measures like legislation to regulate the industry. However, many institutions have also realised that external regulation such as legislation is not enough and that language practitioners in general and text editors specifically needed an internal regulating mechanism. This mechanism was not just something internal to the industry but was more personal, and therefore internal to practitioners themselves. In this regard a properly designed code of ethics was regarded as an indispensable means of setting out to text editors what may be regarded as proper conduct in carrying out their work. No code of ethics for text editors in South Africa exists and text editors {{who are members of}} the South African Translators' Association (SATI) subscribe to the code for translators. This is an undesirable state of affairs as it is important for practitioners to feel that a code is specific to them and "belongs" to them in order for them <b>to</b> subscribe <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> More <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> because a code is part of an internal value system it is important for practitioners to internalise such a code for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be effective. This study, aimed at the design of a code of ethics for text editors, therefore strove to achieve two aims.

The second aim was to involve a selection of practising text editors in the refinement of the draft code in order <b>to</b> finalise <b>it,</b> thus ensuring that the code would be acceptable to the people most affected by it. The result of the project was the establishment of a code that was acceptable to all the practitioners involved up to the conclusion of the project.

Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man’s frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man’s place in the universe.

40|$|The {{production}} and the specificity of hemogeneous organic antibody were investigated by the precipitation test in the agar layer. And the results were as follows. 1. Sensitizing the homogeneous animal (rabbit) by the homogeneous (rabbit) organic (liver, kidney or spleen) antigen, the substance corresponding to the above organic antigen was identified in the sensitized rabbit's blood and the precipitation band was clearly found by the precipitation test of Oudin's method in the agar layer. And the production of antibody by the extracted antigen of homogeneous organ with physiological salt solution was certified. 2. Sensitizing by the organic antigen, the precipitation band appeared most remarkably around the 4 th week after the sensitization. 3. There were both of antigen excess zone and antibody excess zone and the precipitation band was clearly separated {{on the use of}} liver antigen in dilution of 16 times, kidney and spleen antigen in dilution of 8 times and antiserum in dilution of 8 times, when the organic antibody of 40 % was used as the original solution. 4. In the cases sensitized by the organic antigen, the migration velocity of precipitation band was proportional to the squar root of time after the accumulation. 5. Carrying out the Oudin's precipitation test in the agar layer {{on the use of the}} liver, kidney and spleen antigen of homogeneous and heterogeneous animals, the number of the appeared precipitation band was much in th cases sensitized by the homogeneous antigen <b>than</b> <b>that</b> in the cases sensitized by the heterogeneous antigen. As for the antigen-antibody reaction among the organs in the same system, the precipitation band appeared more numerous on the antigen-antibody reaction among the homogeneous organs <b>than</b> <b>that</b> on the antigen-antibody reaction among the heterogeneous organs and the relative specificity of organic antigen was observed. On the other hand, the number of precipitation band appeared at that time was 3 - 4 in the cases sensitized by the liver antigen, 2 - 3 in the cases sensitized by kidney and spleen antigen. In other words, the number of precipitation band showed more numerous in the cases sensitized by the liver antigen than other cases. 6. The reaction of each antigen with the antibody corresponding to each antigen was observed on the cases sensitized by each organ and the appeared state of precipitation band was also hourly observed. The precipitation band appeared the most remarkable around the 3 rd. week after the end of sensitization and the precipitation band corresponding to the organic antigen appeared more early in the cases sensitized by the spleen antigen <b>than</b> <b>that</b> in the cases sensitized by other organic antigen. Moreover, It was seen that the disappeared precipitation band appeared again after several weeks or the number of precipitation band increased after several weeks. 7.
