5|$|Bristol Bridge, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> {{crossing}} the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested {{to cope with}} the amount of traffic that needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. Eleven people were killed and 45 injured, {{making it one of the}} worst riots of the 18th century.|$|E

50|$|During the Soviet Era of Stagnation, camping, and {{especially}} its intense forms such as alpinism, kayaking/canoeing, and canyoning, became {{a form of}} escapism for young people, who felt that these activities were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> life in which such values as courage, friendship, risk, trust, cooperation, and mutual support still mattered. It is these types of situations and virtues that tourist songs use for their subject matter.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Matthias as king was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> avoiding a protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai {{was the first}} baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised {{that he and his}} allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride.|$|E
5|$|The most {{inflammatory}} rumour {{was that}} Washington would launch an attack {{to liberate the}} north when all anti-communists had fled south. It claimed that the Americans would use atomic bombs and that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> avoiding death in a nuclear holocaust was to move south. Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the petrol tanks of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.|$|E
40|$|The more bigger a {{building}} project becomes, {{the more complex}} it will be, coupled {{with the fact that}} clients are now demanding for higher quality at a reduced cost and budget, these and many other challenges are faced by construction companies on how to adopt a strategy for higher quality at a reduced cost without affecting their profit margin and the clients requirement. This study recommends TQM as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> solving these challenges in the construction industry...|$|R

5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept has}} been heavily criticized. Because {{there are no}} {{nominations}} or votings off like in Big Brother, psychologists assume that harassment and bullying will be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> getting rid of one's rivals and obtaining the reward. This would provide a very wrong role model for the youth of the Netherlands. Murray Stone therefore promised to introduce a bully referee. The producers rather expect that housemates will leave if they experience homesickness or family-complications will occur (death, birth or sickness).|$|R

25|$|In the 1990s, {{the growth}} of {{organized}} crime (see Russian mafia and Russian oligarchs) and the fragmentation of law enforcement agencies in Russia coincided with a sharp rise in violence against business figures, administrative and state officials, and other public figures. The second President of Russia Vladimir Putin inherited these problems when he took office, and during his election campaign in 2000, the new president won popular support by stressing the need to restore law and order and to bring {{the rule of law}} to Russia as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> restoring confidence in the country's economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{conformal}} latitude {{defines a}} transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius {{such that the}} angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid {{is the same as}} the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of small elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the Transverse Mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).|$|E

25|$|During the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> {{summoning}} {{a servant}} was by calling, or a handbell. This meant a servant had {{to remain on}} duty within earshot at all times (straight-backed uncomfortable hall chairs designed to keep servants awake date from this period). However, the early 19th century invention of the bell pull, a complicated system of wires and chains within ceiling and wall cavities, meant a servant could be summoned from a greater distance, and therefore also kept at a greater distance. From this time on it became fashionable for servants to be as near to invisible as possible, which fitted exactly with the next change in architectural and aesthetic fashions.|$|E
25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} {{have played}} a significant part in disaster management and emergencies. In 1991, during the Gulf War, a lone Indian ham operator in Kuwait, provided {{the only means of}} communication between stranded Indian nationals in that country and their relatives in India. Amateur radio operators have also played a helpful part in disaster management. Shortly after the 1993 Latur and 2001 Gujarat earthquakes, the central government rushed teams of ham radio operators to the epicentre to provide vital communication links. In December 2004, a group of amateur radio operators on DX-pedition on the Andaman Islands witnessed the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. With communication lines between the islands severed, the group provided <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> relaying live updates and messages to stations across the world.|$|E
25|$|On June 26, 1939, the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office {{reported}} to the British Cabinet that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> ending the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and the current crisis with Nazi Germany threatening Poland made it militarily unadvisable. If {{the bulk of the}} Royal Navy was sent to Singapore, Britain {{would not be able to}} impose a blockade on Germany should the Reich invade Poland, and as such one of Britain's main deterrents against Adolf Hitler invading Poland would be removed, something that would encourage Hitler to choose war. In addition, Chamberlain faced strong pressure from the French not to weaken British naval strength in the Mediterranean given the danger that Benito Mussolini might honor the Pact of Steel should war break out in Europe. The Pact of Steel signed in Rome in May 1939 was an offensive-defensive German-Italian alliance, which meant there was a real possibility that if war with Germany began, Italy would join in.|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{debates about}} the European culture are either grouped around the concept of cultural homogenization, phenomenon found in a strong causal relationship with what the globalization and mondialisation really are, or designate a reality that exists beyond denial or demolition – cultural diversity.

One has to consider that the cultural diversity records a plurality of ideas, images, values and expressions, within the coexistence of parallel cultures (national, ethnic, regional, local, etc.) ...|$|R
