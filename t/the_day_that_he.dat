He had previously declined to spend a day with it, believing that it was being given to much older winners only because of the lockout. Olmstead also noted, at the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was happy to have the Stanley Cup again. Olmstead died at his home in High River, Alberta on November 16, 2015, due to complications from a stroke.|$|E

Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got married.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E

5|$|During the Chunin Exams, Orochimaru plans the {{invasion}} of Konoha with the ninja of Sunagakure to not only kill Hiruzen but also claim the body of Itachi's brother Sasuke Uchiha. To that end, Orochimaru infiltrated the Chunin Exam's Forest of Death round by killing a Grass ninja named Shiore and assuming his identity to personally test Sasuke before branding him with a Curse Mark once satisfied with the youth's abilities. For {{the duration of the}} Exams, Orochimaru laid in wait and secretly murdered the Fourth Kazekage to assume his identity and get close to his mentor as {{the invasion}} begins. However, Orochimaru is forced to retreat when Hiruzen sacrifices himself through the Reaper Death Seal to take away Orochimaru's ability to perform jutsu with his forces pulling back while Sunagakure later learns of Orochimaru's treachery. Wanting to regain the ability to use jutsu, Orochimaru attempts to get aid from Tsunade before seeking out another way to cure himself. When all his efforts prove unsuccessful, Orochimaru sends his Sound Four to fetch Sasuke, hoping that a body-transfer will allow him to use his arms again. Though he waits as long as he can, Sasuke takes too long to arrive and Orochimaru is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners instead. Once Sasuke arrives, Orochimaru decides to train him instead until <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{will be able to take}} the body for himself.|$|E

When he wakes up, he runs in his pajamas to Professor Oak's laboratory where Ash runs into his rival and the Professor's grandson, Gary Oak. Gary proceeds to taunt Ash for arriving to the ceremony late and brags about having already received his first Pokémon. When Ash enters Professor Oak's lab to receive his Pokémon, he is told that all three starter Pokémon have already been taken. Ash pleads for any Pokémon and Oak replies that he still has one left. Ash does not care and receives the Pokémon, which {{turns out to be the}} electric-type Pokémon Pikachu. Ash thinks that it is cute, but it gives him an electric shock when he picks it up to hug it.

25|$|Elizabeth Graeme married Henry Fergusson on April 21, 1772 {{without her}} father's consent. This caused quite {{a problem for}} the newlyweds. Henry and Elizabeth had been {{introduced}} to each other by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a founding father of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1771 at one of the salons hosted by Elizabeth and Dr. Graeme. Fergusson was a recent and penniless Scottish Immigrant and he was eleven years younger than Elizabeth. Both of these qualities made him a less than ideal suitor for Elizabeth's hand in marriage and Dr. Graeme forbade that they marry. Four months after they met, Henry and Elizabeth married secretly in Old Swede's Church. Only their close friends attended, including Benjamin Rush, Provost William Smith and his wife. Despite her father's disapproval, Elizabeth had vowed to let her marriage be known. Ironically, the day on which she decided to tell him the news was <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suffered his fatal heart attack, with Elizabeth watching him approach Graeme Park through a window of the mansion. Elizabeth was never able to tell of her marriage. She was Dr. Graeme's only living heir, she inherited Graeme Park and by right of marriage Henry Fergusson gained title to the property. With his sudden new fortune Henry Fergusson was able to quickly ascend the Philadelphia society ladder. He traveled to England twice, became director of a prominent Philadelphia library and was awarded the title magistrate in Philadelphia. He was the last magistrate of Philadelphia under British colonial rule. He sailed once more for England in late 1775 just as the American Revolution was beginning to gather steam. He returned to Philadelphia by way of New York City as a loyalist with Sir William Howe commander of the British forces in American. With Howe, Fergusson witnessed the Battle of Brandywine and the occupation of Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. Fergusson involved his wife in his activities by sending her as a messenger to General George Washington to ask for his surrender and to present a bribe to a major in the Continental Army. Both of these incidents caused the Patriots of Philadelphia to doubt her loyalty. There was no doubt about where Henry Fergusson's loyalties lay. He was found a traitor by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania and Graeme Park was seized under the Confiscation Act of 1778.|$|E

In January 2010, he was named as part of the England Lions squad to tour the United Arab Emirates for a series against Pakistan A. The England head coach, Andy Flower, described Kieswetter's performances during that tour as [...] "a really good start", and described the Twenty20 warm-up match between the England Lions and the England senior team that followed the tour as [...] "a chance for him to impress".

500|$|Smetana's biographers {{describe}} him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive.

Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the [...] "Wagnerism" [...] in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life.

500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would put on the cape and become Superman.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses told {{the heads of}} the Israelite tribes God's {{commands}} about commitments ( [...] , nedarim, commonly translated, or some say mistranslated, as [...] "vows"). If a man made a vow to God, he was to carry out all that he promised. If a girl living in her father's household made a vow to God, and her father learned of it and did not object, her vow would stand. But if her father objected on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> learned of it, her vow would not stand, and God would forgive her. If she married while her vow was still in force, and her husband learned of it and did not object on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found out, her vow would stand. But if her husband objected on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> learned of it, her vow would not stand, and God would forgive her. The vow of a widow or divorced woman was binding. If a married woman made a vow and her husband learned of it and did not object, then her vow would stand. But if her husband objected on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> learned of it, her vow would not stand, and God would forgive her.
