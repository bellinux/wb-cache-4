5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> on 5 March 1965, the Barrel Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April. Barrel Roll was {{to continue in the}} northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and control of that area was handed over to the American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|Boniface {{accompanied}} {{the queen and}} Prince Edward to Burgos for the marriage of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward's knighting. But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth, where a series of ecclesiastical laws were published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts. These decrees were done without royal consent and thus was tantamount to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> in 1258.|$|E

5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Safety Camp with the dogs, after risking {{his own life}} to rescue a dog-team that had fallen into a crevasse. When the slower pony party arrived, one of the animals was in very poor condition and died shortly afterwards. Later, as the surviving ponies were crossing the sea ice near Hut Point, the ice broke up. Despite a determined rescue attempt, three more ponies died. Of the eight ponies <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> the depot-laying journey, only two returned home.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg {{served as}} {{chancellor}} at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1958 to 1961. His term {{coincided with a}} relaxation of McCarthy-era restrictions on students' freedom of expression <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> under his predecessor, Clark Kerr. In October 1958, Seaborg announced that the University had relaxed its prior prohibitions on political activity on a trial basis, and the ban on communists speaking on campus was lifted. This {{paved the way for}} the Free Speech Movement of 1964-65.|$|E
5|$|The Murano was {{announced}} in 2005 when Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was experiencing a condominium boom <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> in the late 1990s; between 1998 and 2004 more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings had been converted into rental and condominium apartments. The project was jointly developed by Thomas Properties Group of Los Angeles and P Associates of Philadelphia. The planned site of the Murano was on West Market Street in Center City, an area which had not had any residential development until 2002 when 2121 Market Street was converted into apartments. Construction began {{around the end of}} 2005.|$|E

5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring the redesign, they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the redesign of United States coinage <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> in 1907.|$|E
5|$|As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} politics throughout {{the reign of the}} new monarch, RadamaII, instead preferring to focus on his military responsibilities. Meanwhile, disputes between Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and King Radama grew frequent as the young sovereign pursued radical reforms <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> to foment displeasure among the traditional masses. The situation came to a head on 7 May 1863, when Radama insisted on legalizing duels, despite widespread concern among the king's advisers that the innovation would lead to anarchy. The Prime Minister initiated the arrest of the menamaso, the prince's influential advisers, while Rainilaiarivony enacted his brother's instructions to keep the peace in the capital city. However, the situation deteriorated in dramatic fashion and, by the morning of 12 May, King RadamaII was declared dead, having been strangled on the Prime Minister's orders.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{had become}} the key {{logistical}} artery for PAVN and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF or commonly, Viet Cong), {{in their effort to}} conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

5|$|By early 1988 both No.3 and No.77 Squadrons had {{successfully}} converted to the F/A-18, and No. 79 Squadron {{was no longer}} required. Preparations to return the unit's Mirages to Australia {{took place during the}} first months of 1988, and on 3May they departed Butterworth. As the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet squadrons were to be based in Australia, this marked the end of the permanent deployment of RAAF fighters to Butterworth <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> in mid-1958. No.79 Squadron's aircraft commemorated the occasion by conducting a spectacular low-altitude flypast of the base, the first leg of which commenced at transonic speed. The aircraft were flown to Woomera in central Australia to be placed in storage via Paya Lebar, Bali, Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal. Most of No.79 Squadron's ground crew returned to Australia in late May, and the squadron was formally disbanded at Butterworth on 30June 1988.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel's {{unit was}} called up in March 1891 during the shearers' strike <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> earlier that year. Leading his troops {{and a small}} {{detachment}} of Queensland Police, Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of strikebreakers to a station north of Charleville. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted sheep shearers. When the inspector {{in charge of the}} police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in Clermont, and later the district around Longreach.|$|E
5|$|Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} about 1990 or 1992 {{as part of}} {{the contemporary}} Indigenous art movement <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> at Papunya in the 1970s. By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions, such as Charles Sturt University, and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du quai Branly. Petrick's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong, {{as well as at the}} Australian embassy in Washington in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Miller's only solo album, a 2000 concert {{recording}} entitled Solo, {{was released}} in 2010 and was well received by critics for the imagination and harmonic development in Miller's playing. Also in 2010, Miller joined guitarist John Scofield's new band. That year, Miller had a minor stroke. After this, he took medicine, changed his diet and lost weight; he also reduced his touring and recording. In February 2012 he traveled to Denmark to play with Klüvers Big Band; selections {{from one of the}} five concerts were released under Miller's co-leadership as Grew's Tune. In autumn 2012 he performed as a piano duo with Kenny Barron, continuing an association <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> some years earlier. In the winter of that year he toured Europe as part of a quintet led by reeds players Yusef Lateef and Archie Shepp.|$|E
5|$|Political forces {{beyond the}} borders of Egypt {{exacerbated}} the internal problems of the Ptolemaic kingdom. AntiochusIII the Great and PhilipV of Macedon had made a pact to divide Egypt's overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace, while the Battle of Panium (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Meanwhile, in the south of Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> during the reign of PtolemyIV, led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer. Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young PtolemyV was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign), and the Memphis decree issued.|$|E
5|$|The Whitehall Theatre {{opened in}} 1930 {{at the north}} west end of the street, on a site that had {{previously}} been Ye Old Ship Tavern in the 17th century. The revue Whitehall Follies opened in 1942, which drew controversy over its explicit content featuring the stripper and actress Phyllis Dixey. The theatre became known for its farces, reviving a tradition on Whitehall <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> with court jesters at the palace during the 16th century. These included several plays featuring actor-manager Brian Rix throughout the 1950s and 60s, and 1981's satirical Anyone for Denis, written by John Wells and Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams. The venue was Grade II listed in 1996, and renamed the Trafalgar Studios in 2004.|$|E
