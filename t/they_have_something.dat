5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
25|$|Before she {{can pursue}} this further, she {{is put in}} a Time Transfer box and sent Back Way Back, or in more usual terms, to about 150,000 BCE. She is left on Santa Catalina itself, still forested rather than the barren island of later millennia. Her job is to raise food for a Company resort on Santa Cruz Island, where rich folks come back to hobnob with mastodons and hunt saber-tooths, or maybe vice versa. Her memory has been {{interfered}} with, so she can no longer remember details of the history she once knew. She also has a mission to alert the Company when certain unusual beings show up to colonize {{the center of the}} island. Apparently <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> the Company needs....|$|E
500|$|... "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] was remixed by David Cole and Robert Clivillés of C+C Music Factory. Although over fifteen various edits and {{extended}} mixes were created, {{for the most}} part they are based on the [...] "C+C Club Mix." [...] Other variations, extended mixes, and edits include but are not limited to the [...] "All That and More Mix," [...] "Dave's Empty Pass," [...] and the [...] "Boriqua Tribe Mix". Cory Rooney and Mark Morales created a [...] "Soul Convention Mix" [...] and a stringapella for the song. Because of the large number of remixes, two maxi singles were released in the US Carey was given co-producing credit for both the C mixes and the Soul Convention/Stringapella, the first time that she had been given producing credit on remixes of her songs. Gregg Shapiro from the Windy City Times complimented the remix, writing [...] "the presence of each improves on the original. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> new to say; even with the songs that began as dance tracks." [...] Jose F. Promis gave the C+C remix two and a half out of five stars, writing how the remix found Carey [...] "getting quite gritty and earthy." [...] He concluded his review with [...] "It made for a topnotch dancefloor number, and stands as an excellent example of early- to mid-'90s dance music, not to mention being one of the singer's most compelling, underrated, and forgotten efforts." ...|$|E

2500|$|The method {{especially}} {{appeals to}} people handicapped by a ruthless work ethic – Germans, Japanese and Americans.

2500|$|The Syrian {{government}} {{disputed the}} claims, stating {{that these were}} [...] "lies from the United States" [...] and that the American troops had violated international law and Syrian sovereignty. An 2009 investigation by Vanity Fair that interviewed Syrian eyewitnesses, including a man shot during the raid, {{cast doubt on the}} Ghadiya assertion. [...] Former Clinton administration official Robert Malley, who met with State Department officials at the time, was quoted in the article affirming that Ghadiya was killed in the raid. [...] However, former CIA officer Robert Baer was highly skeptical, saying, [...] "If they brought back an al-Qaeda body, why don't <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something?</b> There's no conceivable way they would have killed him and not shown it".|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the MBTI depends on honest self-reporting. Unlike some personality questionnaires, such as the 16PF Questionnaire, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, or the Personality Assessment Inventory, the MBTI does not use validity scales to assess exaggerated or socially desirable responses. As a result, individuals motivated to do so can fake their responses, and {{one study found that}} the MBTI judgment/perception dimension correlates weakly with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire lie scale. If respondents [...] "fear <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to lose, they may answer as they assume they should." [...] However, the MBTI ethical guidelines state, [...] "It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used to screen out applicants." [...] The intent of the MBTI is to provide [...] "a framework for understanding individual differences, and... a dynamic model of individual development".|$|E

2500|$|Plays {{within this}} group are absurd {{in that they}} focus not on logical acts, {{realistic}} occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical. [...] The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections. According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is [...] "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose" [...] Absurdist drama asks its viewer to [...] "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors". Though Theatre of the Absurd {{may be seen as}} nonsense, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to say and can be understood". Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" [...] in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: [...] "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after winning}} the Newbery Medal for her 1962 [...] "junior novel" [...] A Wrinkle in Time, L'Engle {{discussed}} children's books in The New York Times Book Review. The writer of a good children's book, she observed, may need {{to return to the}} [...] "intuitive understanding of his own childhood", being childlike although not childish. [...] She claimed, [...] "It's often possible to make demands of a child that couldn't be made of an adult... a child will often understand scientific concepts that would baffle an adult. This is because he can understand with a leap of the imagination that [...] is denied the grown-up who has acquired the little knowledge that is a dangerous thing." [...] Of philosophy, etc., as well as science, [...] "the child will come to it with an open mind, whereas many adults come closed to an open book. This is one reason so many writers turn to fantasy (which children claim as their own) when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> important and difficult to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{produced}} the pilot episode, [...] "Trash-O-Madness", at his studio in Saratoga; he animated {{half of the}} episode, and the production occurred entirely in the United States, with animation in Saratoga and processing in San Francisco. While directing during recording sessions, Murray preferred {{to be on the}} stage with the actors instead of [...] "behind glass" [...] in a control room, which he describes as [...] "the norm" [...] while making animated series. He believes that, due to his lack of experience with children, Rocko's Modern Life [...] "skewed kind of older". Murray noted, [...] "There's a lot of big kids out there. People went to see 'Roger Rabbit' and saw all these characters they'd grown up with and said, 'Yeah, why don't <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> like that anymore?'" [...] When he began producing Rocko, he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production. He said that the approach, when used for production of television shows, was [...] "driving me crazy". This led him to allow for other team members to manage aspects of the Rocko's Modern Life production. Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films. Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series, making Hillenburg's first job in the animation business as a director.|$|E
50|$|Warner Bros. {{apparently}} thought <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in the character, and Beaky {{was featured}} in some Looney Tunes merchandising of the time, such as a metal bank. Even as late as 1973, he appeared on Pepsi bottle.|$|R

60|$|Andrew was favorably {{impressed}} by the man. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in common, for both were imbued {{with a sense of}} responsibility. Murray had lightly indicated this, and Andrew knew that West Africa is far from a desirable place to live.|$|R
2500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Don't Say a Word", was {{described}} as [...] "gorgeously electronic" [...] while [...] "morphing through synthscapes". [...] "My Blood" [...] was written and produced by Goulding and Eliot and {{was described}} as echoing the vocals of Adele. [...] "Anything Could Happen" [...] is an electro ballad written and produced by Goulding and Eliot, containing [...] "spurting synths and a sky-kissing chorus". The fourth track [...] "Only You" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "somewhere in between, thunderous and electrifying but bereft of the kind of earworms that would make it compulsively replayable". The title track [...] "Halcyon" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Goulding and is an electronic song. The seventh track [...] "Joy" [...] was co-written by Goulding and {{was described as}} a [...] "string-laden affair that showcases her helium-powered pipes". The next song, a cover version of American artist Active Child's 2011 song [...] "Hanging On", contains dubstep, downtempo and dream pop influences. [...] "Explosions" [...] starts with a choir and ambient drums; after the chorus, the piano drops and the production surges to a roar. The 10th song on the album, [...] "I Know You Care", was co-written by Goulding and Justin Parker. Lyrically the song speaks of [...] "her trying to convince someone—us, her lover, herself—that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> worth salvaging". [...] "Atlantis" [...] is lyrically [...] "a quintessential break-up song, balancing moving on, with the helplessness of love and love lost". [...] "Dead in the Water" [...] is the final song on the album, besides the bonus track [...] "I Need Your Love", a collaboration with Scottish musician Calvin Harris.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Long Into an Abyss," [...] {{with the}} Grounders' {{deadline}} imminent, Abby (Clarke's mother) and Jaha disagree {{over what the}} survivors are to do; Jaha wishes to evacuate to the so-called 'City of Light', while Abby wants to remain behind to rescue other members. Clarke and two of her fellow people (Octavia and Bellamy) hold Lincoln in the dropship; he is a Grounder and was experimented on with a serum to become a reaper (a mindless, zombie-like killer). When Lincoln is almost mercy-killed, his heart stops and he is revived by Clarke, who believes curing reapers depends on waiting for the serum to leave their bodies, even though the reaper might temporarily die in the process. With this information, Clarke realizes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to offer the Grounders. When Abby is successful in curing Lincoln, Lexa grants Clarke the truce, but says she {{must be allowed to}} execute Finn before it can begin. In [...] "Spacewalker," [...] Clarke returns to camp and tells them the Grounders will cease their attack if they are given Finn, who is the one who massacred a number of their people. The tension between the people in Camp Jaha rises as opinions are divided whether to give Finn to the Grounders or not. At the camp, Abby and Kane, having returned, think they can bargain with the Grounders by offering to put Finn on trial, but such plans are wasted as Finn gives himself up to the Grounders. In the end, Clarke goes to meet with Lexa in a last-ditch effort to save Finn from the brutal execution process Lincoln has explained. When Lexa refuses clemency, Clarke asks if she can say goodbye to Finn. She approaches, kisses him, and tells him she loves him while stabbing him in the heart, killing him quickly.|$|E
