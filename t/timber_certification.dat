Certified timber automatically qualifies for export to Europe under the VPA, but the SVLK has weaknesses which the VPA may be unable to address. The Timber Regulation might have helped, but it explicitly excludes VPA timber from its due diligence requirements. Critically, though, it continues to apply to Indonesian timber entering the EU via third countries. Whether it can address the SVLK’s shortcomings as regards this timber depends on: (1) whether the SVLK meets the Regulation’s certification scheme reliability criteria; and (2) whether the EUTR considers certification sufficient proof of legality to satisfy due diligence requirements...|$|R

It also examines the potential for MIFEE to meet sustainability requirements under RSPO, ISPO, and FSC. The plantation development plans are characterized {{by a lack of}} reliable official data and limited public disclosure. The available information paints a skewed picture of expected outcomes, where short-term economic benefits from forest clearing dominate and environmental impacts and social implications appear to be underestimated.

On the other hand, FSC <b>certification</b> for <b>timber</b> concessions is not possible. Because MIFEE plantation program is dominated by timber plantations, they weigh heavily on the program's poor sustainability prospects. In order to meet the Indonesian government's own objectives and improve the project's sustainability, the government needs to push for the implementation of oil palm <b>certification</b> and <b>timber</b> legality verification systems, reduce the size of plantations, target non-forestland, prioritize food crops, and secure local acceptance of plantation investments...|$|R

Field survey was conducted in March–April 2012 in 3 districts in Central of Java namely Blora, Wonogiri, and Wonosobo District. The results showed that community forest is mainly planting in their private owned land. It brings 2 consequences. Firstly, their willingness to manage their forest sustainably was emerged without any enforcement from external parties. Secondly, there were autonomous in decision making in their way to manage their forest such as they only planted tree species that easy to sell and valuable, they only cut their trees when they need huge money for children schooling, marriage, illness, and housing. The autonomous decision making gives also the owners (farmers) other alternatives to utilize their land otherwise planting the trees. It is mean, if the policy is decreasing the potential benefits from growing the trees, they can also convert their community forest into other business in which profitable and easy to sell their products. From those facts, it seems the formalization of community forest business through mandatory certification is not a proper policy to enhance the community forest.

Reliable, user-friendly identification tools based on macroscopic morphological features {{have already been}} developed for various tree floras. Wood anatomical features provide also {{a considerable amount of}} information {{that can be used for}} <b>timber</b> traceability, <b>certification</b> and trade control. Yet, this information is still poorly used, and only a handful of experts are able to use it for plant species identification. Here, we present an interactive, user-friendly tool based on vector graphics, illustrating 99 states of 27 wood characters from 110 Amazonian tree species belonging to 34 families. Pl@ntWood is a graphical identification tool based on the IDAO system, a multimedia approach to plant identification. Wood anatomical characters were selected from the IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identification, which will enable us to easily extend this work to a larger number of species. A stand-alone application has been developed and an on-line version will be delivered in the near future. Besides allowing non-specialists to identify plants in a user-friendly interface, this system can be used with different purposes such as teaching, conservation, management, and self-training in the wood anatomy of tropical species.

40|$|The authors {{estimate}} the potential commercial benefits that tropical timber producing countries could enjoy by adopting <b>timber</b> <b>certification</b> schemes. Such benefits are crucial for encouraging {{the supply of}} certified timber. <b>Timber</b> <b>certification</b> is a reality: various countries and organizations have launched initiatives for it. The initial response among producing countries was less than positive, but some {{have come to realize}} its potential benefits and have begun to adopt <b>timber</b> <b>certification</b> schemes. Tropical timber trade accounts for {{only a small fraction of}} tropical timber production, and most of that trade is concentrated among developing countries in Asia and Japan - markets where demand for certified timber is currently weak. Only a small part of the trade reaches the eco-sensitive markets of Europe and the United States, where there is demand for certified timber. Developing countries can benefit commercially from <b>timber</b> <b>certification</b> in two ways: through the"green premium"(consumers'willingness to pay a premium for certified timber"and by averting losses of market share in the tropical timber market from not having timber certified. Based on surveys, on discussions with nongovernmental organizations, on market participants and analysts, and on estimates of price elasticity, the authors develop a scenario for estimating the potential commercial benefits from adopting <b>timber</b> <b>certification.</b> Under this scenario, benefits would not exceed US$ 500 million a year (roughly 4 percent of all tropical-timber-related revenues earned by developing countries). <b>Timber</b> <b>certification</b> is not expected to provide significant commercial benefits to developing countries in the near future. But <b>timber</b> <b>certification</b> could provide significant rents to individual firms that develop market niche strategies.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} components of the forest product lifecycle is the economic and environmentally sustainable establishment of commercial forests (Campbell et al. 2013). It is well known that the management of competing vegetation, or weeds, during this establishment phase underpins long-term forest productivity, ensuring good tree survival, optimal growth and stand uniformity at canopy closure (Wagner et al. 2006). For planted forests, managed for commercial production of timber, herbicides provide the most cost-effective means to achieve optimum control of weeds during this establishment phase (Mendell et al. 2015; Neary and Michael 1996; Rolando et al. 2010). Herbicides have been available to forest growers for over 40  years, and their use and application for weed control has been well documented across most forest-growing regions (Little and Rolando 2002; McCarthy et al. 2011; Rolando et al. 2013; Thompson and Pitt 2003). In addition, the optimal, and most cost-effective, strategy for managing weeds using herbicides is well known for many regions and embedded in local operational practice (Harrington et al. 1995; Rolando et al. 2013; Rolando and Little 2009). Therefore, factors driving further research into new methods of operational forest weed control are largely related to the availability of more environmentally safe herbicides that have the ability to replace current active ingredients or innovative methods able to reduce the dependence on herbicides whilst retaining current levels of productivity at low cost. The shift to reduce dependence on herbicides for forest weed control has been driven by an increasing global awareness of the impacts of pesticides on the wider environment and human health (Baillie 2016; Garrett et al. 2016; Harrington et al. 1995; Little et al. 2006; Rolando et al. 2013; Rolando and Little 2009; Thiffault and Roy 2011; Wagner et al. 1998). For the forest industry, this shift was supported by the emergence of forest certification in the late 1990 s. Established mainly to reduce trade in illegally logged <b>timber,</b> these <b>certification</b> schemes also aim to provide consumers with assurance that wood products are obtained from sustainably managed forests. The result has been a continued requirement for forest growers to revisit their operational weed management programmes to ensure that the use of herbicides also result in minimum impacts to the forest environment whilst remaining cost-effective.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, over 400 million {{hectares}} of tropical forests are {{set aside for}} <b>timber</b> production. Several <b>certification</b> schemes exist to ensure more sustainable exploitation and large areas of production forests are currently certified. Under such schemes, logging companies are required to evaluate whether species are not overexploited and, if necessary, adapt their logging activities. However, the data needed to project exploitation intensities – growth, mortality and regeneration rates of trees – are scarce or non-existent. Tree-ring analysis provides lifetime species-specific growth data {{that can be used}} to allow or improve the projections of timber availability during following logging cycles. In this study, we integrated growth data from tree rings with logging inventory data to forecast timber yields in the next harvest round for four timber species in Cameroon. We compared projections using tree-ring data with projections using fixed growth rates, as set by law and customarily applied in Cameroon. Additionally, we assessed the effect of increasing logging cycles and of using filed-based species-specific logging intensities on the next cycle's yield projections. Under current logging practices, timber volumes available at next logging cycles are projected to be 21 – 36 % of the volumes obtained at first harvest. Simulations using fixed rates often resulted in lower yields with lower volume ingrowth from trees that were below minimum cutting diameters in the first harvest. Lengthening the logging cycle increased yield predictions during the next harvests, but yields were still not sustained over time. This problem can be resolved by using species-specific logging intensities, which led to projected yields of up to 73 % of the initial harvested volume. The growth data provided by tree-ring analysis allows conducting such species-specific projections and thus helps to provide the knowledge base necessary for sustainable forest management. Yet, the low overall yields are a concern to forest conservation, as loss of economic value may lead to conversion of forests to other land uses. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of market-based policy instruments for governing the global forest commons {{has resulted in}} a proposed internationalization of the institutional arrangements, policy standards, and certification practices for assessing the ‘quality’ of forest management systems worldwide. Yet, like other global environmental governance systems before it, proposals for a universalized approach to forest certification have yet to come to fruition. Drawing on insights provided by Malaysia’s efforts to develop and operationalize the Malaysian <b>Timber</b> <b>Certification</b> Scheme (MTCS), I argue that standardization of forest certification systems worldwide is an unlikely and, more importantly, undesirable approach to forest governance. The central findings of this dissertation are thus as follows: 1) Despite many ‘on paper’ changes, the Malaysian <b>Timber</b> <b>Certification</b> Council (MTCC) remains the most powerful actor within the MTCS. As an end result of an uneven distribution of rulemaking authority within the MTCS, the quasi state MTCC continues to dominate a distinctively monopolar MTCS institutional environment; 2) The current configuration of organizations involved in the day-to-day operations of the MTCS is reliant on a small, insular and tight knit group of similarly trained individuals who rely upon a single episteme that elevates state-conferred knowledge above all other ways of knowing; and, 3) Despite this state-derived episteme being a central component of the MTCS epistemic community, the audit process is far more ad hoc than planned. Instead of following a bureaucraticallyprescribed checklist approach to auditing, MTCS auditors simultaneously draw on the technical skill set that auditing demands (technê) and a more localized and contingent performance of their expertise (mētis) in order to make informed judgments. In summary, the MTCC and its scheme represent a highly contextualized approach to forest certification that values national priorities and local circumstances over international standards and norms. As a result, the case of Malaysia’s national forest certification scheme simultaneously challenges the state-derived episteme through which forestry experts are professionalized and, more broadly, the notion that forest certification systems can ever be fully standardized...|$|E

International initiatives such as <b>timber</b> <b>certification</b> or environmental conventions can succeed only if local realities are considered and are meaningful to local stakeholders, which is rarely the case.

40|$|In {{the quest}} for global standards, "Criteria and Indicators" (C&I) are among the {{foremost}} mechanisms for defining and promoting sustainable tropical forest management. Here we examine some challenges posed by this approach, focusing on examples that reflect the ecological aspects of tropical forests at a management-unit level and assessments such as those required in <b>timber</b> <b>certification.</b> C&I can foster better forest management. However, there are confusions and tensions to reconcile between general and local applications, between the ideal and the pragmatic, and between the scientific and the democratic.

Consequently, at both international and national levels, a number of initiatives have come with suggestions of criteria and i ndicators for sustainable forest management determination.
