5|$|The Alaskas were officially {{funded in}} September 1940 {{along with a}} plethora of other ships {{as a part of}} the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in {{addition}} to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan was building super cruisers more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.|$|E

Graves prevented him from receiving the British Distinguished Service Order and the French Legion of Honor, as had {{other members of the}} Inter-Allied Military Council. Eichelberger did, however, receive the Japanese Imperial Order of Meiji, Order of the Sacred Treasure and Order of the Rising Sun. Siberia gave Eichelberger a chance to observe the Japanese Army at first hand, and he was impressed by what he saw of their training and discipline. He concluded that, if properly led, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than a match for American troops. The American Expeditionary Force Siberia was withdrawn in April 1920.|$|E

Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers.

5|$|Revie {{was born}} in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Siwalai Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งศิวาลัยมหาปราสาท) {{is located}} on the southern-eastern end of the Siwalai Garden. The Siwalai Maha Prasat is a Thai-style edifice with a Mondop style spire of seven tiers. Built during the reign of King Rama V in 1878 to house the metal statues of his four predecessors, which were cast in 1869. The hall was {{to be used as a}} royal pantheon, where the lives of {{previous}} monarchs were to be commemorated and worshiped. Later King Rama VI had the statues removed and rehoused at the Prasat Phra Thep Bidorn in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha compound, where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> assessable to the public. On 6 April 1918 the first ceremony of worship was inaugurated, this ceremony continues to be performed annually. Since the removal of the statues, the Siwalai Maha Prasat has been left vacant.|$|E

John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, claimed that the high construction costs, expensive land, and tax increases would make construction unfeasible without the tax break. One developer also claimed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to construct condos instead of rentals without the tax abatement because the differential would make condos comparably more profitable.

In Keedy's absence, Lancashire's young spinners, Stephen Parry and Simon Kerrigan, were given {{opportunities}} in the first team. Kerrigan was chosen ahead of Parry in the four-day team and cemented {{his place in the}} side. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. Their partnership began with them competing to out perform each other. After a discussion the pair decided <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> effective if they worked together to build pressure while bowling.

25|$|He {{improved}} {{the frequency and}} methods of training in marksmanship of all soldiers (including cavalry, and including shooting at moving targets). During this period, the higher ranks of the army were divided on {{the best use of}} cavalry. Smith-Dorrien, along with Lord Roberts, Sir Ian Hamilton and others, doubted that cavalry could often be used as cavalry, i.e. that they should still be trained to charge with sword and lance, instead thinking <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> often deployed as mounted infantry, i.e. using horses for mobility but dismounting to fight. To this end, he took steps to improve the marksmanship of the cavalry. This did not endear him to the arme blanche ('pro-cavalry') faction, which included French and Douglas Haig, and whose views prevailed after the retirement of Lord Roberts.|$|E
25|$|Although {{workers are}} {{generally}} unable to mate, they have functional ovaries {{that allow them}} to lay eggs. Because these eggs are not fertilized, they would become male wasps. Workers would want to produce such wasps as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> closely related to their own sons than to their mothers' sons, or brothers. However, it is not in the queens best interest for workers to produce offspring. This is because a queen would be more closely related to her own offspring (r=1/2) than to her offsprings' sons (r=1/4). When the queen mates with many males, workers are more closely related to their brothers (queens' sons) since r=0.25, than to the sons of other workers since r<0.25 for half-nephews and nephews). The differences in relatedness of offspring between workers and queens represents a conflict of interest between workers and queens, as both workers and queens want to maximize the survival of the offspring more closely related to themselves, according to the selfish gene perspective.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis {{in ancient}} times insisted on the {{marriage}} couple entering into the ketubah as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical mohar – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the bride price). The ketubah became a mechanism whereby the amount due to the wife (the bride-price) came to be paid {{in the event of}} the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or divorce. It may be noted that the biblical mohar created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the mohar at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> likely to have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the mohar {{to be a part of}} the ketubah. It may also be noted that both the mohar and the ketubah amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be the entitlement to alimony in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the ketubah amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.|$|E

500|$|Smith's {{proposal}} received strong endorsement from {{organizations that}} support human trafficking victims and from law enforcement agencies. Marlene Jennings, a Liberal MP, praised Smith's proposal overall but {{argued that it}} did not sufficiently distinguish between human trafficking and prostitution. Smith responded that there is a clear correlation between the two issues. Callandra Cochrane of Citizens for Public Justice said that such a plan [...] "has become an imperative in order to ensure the protection of victims and effectively combat human trafficking," [...] but that Smith's proposal had [...] "definite weaknesses that need to be strengthened." [...] Cochrane praised the document's suggestions that NGOs be granted funding, that efforts be coordinated with First Nations communities, that awareness-raising campaigns be initiated, and that immigration be regulated. She argued that [...] "Connecting the Dots" [...] was too focused on those who create the demand for sex trafficking and did not sufficiently address victim rehabilitation. Loly Rico of the Canadian Council for Refugees made the same complaint. Rico recommended that the proposal be amended to allow human trafficking victims to become permanent residents of Canada so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> effectively protected against being trafficked again.|$|E
