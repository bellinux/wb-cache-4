The shortcomings of the original approach consisting of a periodic network timetable design, queuing models for the estimation of the waiting probability and queue length for the purpose of <b>timetabling</b> <b>and</b> estimation of the operations quality respectively, as well as multiple stochastic simulations are explained and the consistency of the recent stress test simulations are examined. </p...|$|R

By identifying with one's nation, people involve in intergroup comparisons, and tend to derogate out-groups. However, several studies have investigated this relationship between national identity and derogating other countries, and found that identifying with national identity does not necessarily result in out-group derogation.|$|R

30|$|The key {{question}} {{in the context of}} storage of health data is always with regard to the purpose. The GDPR provides several exemptions <b>and</b> <b>derogations</b> for the use of health data, e.g. in the context of research or public health purposes under certain conditions. Typical procedures in this context include the application of ethical standards for scientific research as mentioned in Recital 33 and the implementation of organisational and technical safeguards as mentioned in Article 89 including anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption [2]. Pseudonymisation is generally recommended as long as the research purposes can be fulfilled in this manner. With the condition of such safeguards, the GDPR creates exemptions for researchers to process sensitive health data even beyond the purposes for which they were collected. In addition, the GDPR provides some room for manoeuvre for national regulations (derogations defined by a law) in this context. It is clearly emphasised, however, that exemptions <b>and</b> <b>derogations</b> for research purposes should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers, insurance or banking companies (Recital 54, [1].|$|R
