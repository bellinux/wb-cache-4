5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather than just combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> but the lengths of <b>the</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{subnuclear}} structures {{appear as}} part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods {{has been reported in}} some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{improves}} total burnup. A {{fuel rod}} is reprocessed {{after three years}} of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of <b>the</b> <b>rods.</b> Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.|$|E
50|$|In fact, the {{downward}} acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> which is simultaneous in the grate's frame of reference, is not simultaneous in <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> frame of reference. In <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> frame of reference, {{the bottom of}} the front of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is first accelerated downward (not shown in drawing), and as time goes by, more and more of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is subjected to {{the downward}} acceleration, until finally the back of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is accelerated downward. This results in a bending of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> in <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> frame of reference. It should be stressed that, since this bending occurs in <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> rest frame, it is a true physical distortion of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> which will cause stresses to occur in <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rod blanks can be {{purchased}} with guide locations preset for <b>the</b> individual <b>rod</b> or placed by hand. Rod sections tend to be directional, wanting to flex in a certain direction over others. Rod builders usually test each rod section to find the point of greatest flex (aka spining <b>the</b> <b>rod)</b> so that guides can be aligned along it. With the placement around <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> determined, <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> builder next determines where {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> to place <b>the</b> guides. This is usually done by taping the guides onto <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> stringing <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> flexing it and moving each guide to achieve the best fit to <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> natural flex.|$|R
50|$|The {{action of}} a taper is {{described}} by the flex of {{the tip of a}} rod when pressure is applied perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> Only a section of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> starting at <b>the</b> tip of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> should bend while the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> should stay rigid.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through <b>the</b> <b>rods.</b> This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reaction}} force on <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> from either circular guide is frictionless, {{so it must}} be directed along the rod; there can be no component of the {{reaction force}} perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> Taking moments about the center of <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> there can be no moment acting on <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> so its angular momentum remains constant. Because <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> starts with zero angular momentum, it must continue to have zero angular momentum for all time.|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> usual <b>rod</b> and slot paradox, <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> if it falls, was {{expected}} {{to fall into the}} slot due to gravity. Many thought experiments have been conducted where the presence of gravity is eliminated with <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and slot approaching each other along a line joining their centers, whereby the considerations come strictly under Special Relativity. In these experiments the line of motion is not parallel to either the axis of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> or <b>the</b> slot. In this paper we consider in detail the two cases when <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> does fall into the slot and when <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> does not fall into the slot, each {{from the perspective of the}} co-moving frames of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and <b>the</b> slot. We show that whether <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> falls into <b>the</b> slot as determined by Galilean kinematics is also valid under relativistic kinematics; this determination does not depend upon the magnitude of the velocity, but only on the proper lengths and the proper angles of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and slot with the line of motion. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that the passing (or crashing) of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> as a wholesome event is unaffected by relativistic kinematics. We also provide a simple formula to determine whether or not <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> passes through <b>the</b> slot. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rod</b> of Seven Parts {{was also}} a {{featured}} item in a fantasy novel by Douglas Niles, titled <b>The</b> <b>Rod</b> of Seven Parts. [...] The story deals {{with the return of}} <b>the</b> <b>Rod</b> and <b>the</b> forces of Chaos trying to keep it apart. This makes <b>the</b> <b>Rod</b> <b>the</b> only major Dungeons & Dragons magical artifact to be featured in its own stand alone product and a novel.|$|R
5|$|Pushing {{design to}} the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets {{to be worn}} on the head, {{allowing}} the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented {{a new type of}} rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. <b>The</b> <b>rods</b> were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went {{out of her way to}} perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Moli√®re and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich-Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.|$|E
25|$|Many dowsers today use a pair {{of simple}} L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm {{pointing}} forward. When something is found, <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> cross over one another making an X over the found object. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. <b>The</b> <b>rods</b> are sometimes fashioned from wire coat hangers, and glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were not uncommon in early 19th-century New England.|$|E
25|$|Following Legasov's death, all {{remaining}} RBMKs were retrofitted with {{a number}} of updates for safety. The largest of these updates fixes the RBMK control rod design. The control rods have graphite tips attached, which prevent coolant water from entering the space vacated as <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> are withdrawn. In the original design, those displacers, being shorter than the height of the core, left columns of water at the bottom when <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> were fully extracted; during insertion, the graphite would first displace that water, locally increasing reactivity. Also, when <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> were in their uppermost position, the absorber tips were outside the core, requiring a relatively large displacement before achieving a significant reduction in reactivity. These design flaws were likely the final trigger of the first explosion of the Chernobyl accident, causing {{the lower part of the}} core to become supercritical when they tried to shut down the highly destabilized reactor by reinserting <b>the</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E
50|$|Parasitic modes {{occur when}} {{reflections}} are generated in directions other than {{along the length}} of <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> which can use up energy that would otherwise be available to the beam. This can be a particular problem if the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is polished. Cylindrical laser rods support whispering gallery modes due to total internal reflection between <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and <b>the</b> cooling water, which reflect continuously around the circumference of <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> Light pipe modes can reflect down the length of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> in a zig-zag path. If <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> has an antireflection coating, or is immersed in a fluid that matches its refractive index, it can dramatically reduce these parasitic reflections. Likewise, if the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is rough ground (frosted), or grooved, internal reflections can be dispersed.|$|R
25|$|Fly rods are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} carbon {{graphite}}. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). <b>The</b> <b>rod</b> tapers {{from one end to}} the other and the degree of taper determines how much of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> flexes when stressed. The larger amount of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> that flexes <b>the</b> 'slower' <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> guides along <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> with <b>the</b> most 'give'. This is done by flexing <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{method is}} to use a clock {{indicating}} its proper time , which is traveling from one endpoint of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> to <b>the</b> other in time [...] as measured by clocks in <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> rest frame. <b>The</b> length of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> can be computed by multiplying its travel time by its velocity, thus [...] in <b>the</b> <b>rod's</b> rest frame or [...] in the clock's rest frame.|$|R

25|$|The {{production}} of tritium was resumed with irradiation of rods containing lithium (replacing the usual control rods containing boron, cadmium, or hafnium), at the reactors {{of the commercial}} Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station in 2003‚Äì2005 followed by extraction of tritium from <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> at the new Tritium Extraction Facility at the Savannah River Site beginning in November 2006. Tritium leakage from <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> during reactor operations limits the number {{that can be used}} in any reactor without exceeding the maximum allowed tritium levels in the coolant.|$|E

50|$|Rod {{and frame}} {{illusion}} occurs {{because of the}} effect of the orientation of the frame on <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> In <b>the</b> simplest example of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and frame illusion, the illusion will cause the participant to perceive <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> to be oriented congruent with the orientation of the frame. When the participant is viewing <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and frame that are both positioned at 0 degrees (or vertical), he or she perceives <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> as vertical with perfect accuracy. However, when the frame is tilted away from vertical, the participant's perception of vertical is affected. The participant tends to perceive <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> to be tilted {{in the same direction as}} the frame is oriented (e.g., if the frame is tilted in the counterclockwise direction, <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> will also be perceived as being tilted counterclockwise). As the tilt of the frame increases, the participants' perceived vertical increasingly deviates from true vertical.|$|R
50|$|From the {{perspective}} of <b>the</b> grate, <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> undergoes a length contraction and fits into the grate. However, from {{the perspective}} of <b>the</b> <b>rod,</b> it is <b>the</b> grate undergoing a length contraction, through which it seems <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> is then too long to fall.|$|R

25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{allows the}} field to effectively be turned on and off above or below the plane of <b>the</b> <b>rods,</b> depending on the rotation of <b>the</b> <b>rods.</b> Such a device makes an efficient mechanical magnetic latch requiring no power. A detailed study of this arrangement has shown that each rod is subject to a strong torque from its neighboring rods, and therefore requires mechanical stabilization. However, a simple and efficient solution, providing both stabilization {{and the ability to}} rotate each rod alternately, is simply to provide an equal gearing arrangement on each rod, as shown in the figure.|$|E

For readings greater than 7 ft the target is attached to top section of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> and <b>the</b> top section is raised/lowered until it the target intersects with the cross hair of <b>the</b> level. <b>The</b> <b>rod</b> is then locked and the zero of Vernier scale on the back of <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> will be aligned with the target's height.|$|R
25|$|The bending curve determines <b>the</b> way a <b>rod</b> {{builds up}} and {{releases}} its power. This influences {{not only the}} casting and the fish-fighting properties, but also the sensitivity to strikes when fishing lures, the ability to set a hook (which is also related to the mass of <b>the</b> <b>rod),</b> <b>the</b> control over the lure or bait, <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>rod</b> should be handled and how the power is distributed over <b>the</b> <b>rod.</b> On a full progressive <b>rod,</b> <b>the</b> power is distributed most evenly over <b>the</b> whole <b>rod.</b>|$|R
25|$|Care for {{telescopic}} {{fishing rods}} {{is much the}} same as other rods. The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic fishing rod open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often <b>the</b> <b>rods</b> come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or sand in the joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.|$|E
