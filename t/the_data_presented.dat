In building on <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>presented</b> here by the UN, the World Bank goes on to explain that access to water for producing food {{will be one of the}} main challenges in the decades to come. Access to water will need to be balanced with the importance of managing water itself in a sustainable way while taking into account the impact of climate change, and other environmental and social variables.|$|E

[...] It was also noted that with the advent of drug eluting stents, interventional cardiologists began performing procedures on more complex lesions, subsequently using the drug eluting stents in [...] "off label" [...] coronary artery lesions, which would otherwise go untreated or for bypass surgery. [...] The FDA advisory board reiterated the ACC guidelines that clopidogrel should be continued for 12 months after drug eluting stent placement in individuals who are at low risk for bleeding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Deep web is {{the part}} of web that is not {{technically}} accessible to a search engine’s crawler. The Deep web contains more than five hundred times <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>present</b> in <b>the</b> surface web that search engines normally search. But we don’t have access to these data directly. In this paper, we propose a unified architecture for accessing <b>the</b> <b>data</b> from Deep web databases. We have also used the heuristic of using <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>present</b> for input restricted fields in the forms for automatically filling the unified query interface to extract <b>the</b> <b>data</b> from <b>the</b> deep web databases. We have evaluated our work using the precision metric by considering data from ten Deep web databases. In future, we have plans {{to increase the number of}} databases from which we extract <b>the</b> deep web <b>data</b> and also to increase the range of queries that are to be answered by extracting <b>data</b> from <b>the</b> Deep web databases. We are also working on tracking changes in deep web databases using an incremental crawl strategy. Index Terms—Deep web, surfacing, query interface, forms, data extractio...|$|R
