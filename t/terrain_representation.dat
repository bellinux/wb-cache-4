50|$|Berghaus {{had been}} riding {{numerous}} hobbyhorses (<b>terrain</b> <b>representation,</b> isolines, scale indicators, map projections, etc.) without much success, {{but now he}} could finally put them to work with his pupils. He very successfully disseminated many of his ideas and concepts. Moreover, his students somehow learned better than he to limit their endeavours {{in order to bring}} more of them to full fruition. Though the school itself had but few students, its residency in Potsdam, connected by rail to Berlin, and the fame of Berghaus attracted many geographers (e.g. Alexander von Humboldt, Carl Ritter and Zeune), cartographers and explorers. Petermann spoke highly of his encounters with von Humboldt and has drawn several maps for his Atlas von Asien, on which the rendering of the Asiatic mountain-chains was of a quality corresponding to the then current view of the geographic sciences.Because of all these contacts the students were confronted with many opinions and views on the state of science and the world that would not normally have been part of their curriculum. Besides, we may take Poggendorff seriously when he sees Petermann as ‘private secretary and librarian of H.K.W. Berghaus’ in the years 1839-45, so we can assume that Petermann was at least quite up to date on many affairs to do with geography and cartography, for Berghaus had large collections of maps, books and notes to draw on.|$|E

40|$|A {{mobile robot}} needs an {{internal}} representation of its environment {{in order to}} accomplish its mission. Building such a representation involves transforming raw data from sensors into a meaningful geometric representation. In this paper, we introduce techniques for building <b>terrain</b> <b>representations</b> from range data for an outdoor mobile robot. We introduce three levels of representations that correspond to levels of planning: obstacle maps, terrain patches, and high resolution elevation maps. Since <b>terrain</b> <b>representations</b> from individual locations are not sufficient for many navigation tasks, we also introduce techniques for combining multiple maps. Combining maps may be achieved either by using features or the raw elevation data. Finally, we introduce algorithms for combining 3 -D descriptions with descriptions from other sensors, such as color cameras. We examine the need for this type of sensor fusion when some semantic information has to be extracted from an observed scene and provide an example application of outdoor scene analysis. Many of the techniques presented in this paper have been tested in the field on three mobile robot systems developed at CMU...|$|R
40|$|This chapter reviews recent {{development}} in terrain generalisation. We focus {{on issues of}} aesthetics and legibility {{in the application of}} cartographic generalisation. Generalisation methods are relevant to traditional <b>terrain</b> <b>representations</b> (spot heights, contours, hypsometric colours, shaded relief) and to grid and triangulated surface generalisation. First we consider issues related to relief representation at different scales. As generalisation requires knowledge about the terrain morphology, several approaches focusing on the classification of terrain features according to morphometric or topological criteria have been developed. Cartographic generalisation methods are reviewed with consideration given to conflicts between <b>terrain</b> <b>representations</b> and other object type data on the map. In the second part of this chapter, three case studies illustrating previous developments are presented. First, a generalisation method for hypsometric map production is described where important valleys and mountain ridges are accentuated to improve their representation. Second, a method selecting features represented by isobaths and answering specific constraints of nautical charts is presented. The third case study is a generalisation method which models the relationship between terrain and other objects such as buildings and rivers...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 154 - 158. Terrain rendering is {{a crucial}} part of many real-time computer graphics applications such as video games and visual simulations. It provides the main frame-ofreference for the observer and constitutes the basis of an imaginary or simulated world that encases the observer. Storing and rendering terrain models in real-time applications usually require a specialized approach due to the sheer magnitude of data available and the level of detail demanded. The easiest way to process and visualize such large amounts of data in real-time is to constrain the terrain model in several ways. This process of regularization decreases the amount of data to be processed and also the amount of processing power needed at the cost of expressivity and the ability to create interesting terrains. The most popular <b>terrain</b> <b>representation,</b> by far, used by modern real-time graphics applications is a regular 2 D grid where the vertices are displaced in a third dimension by a displacement map, conventionally called a height map. It is the simplest and fastest possible <b>terrain</b> <b>representation,</b> but {{it is not possible to}} represent complex terrain models that include interesting terrain features such as caves, overhangs, cliffs and arches using a simple 2 D grid and a height map. We propose a novel <b>terrain</b> <b>representation</b> combining the voxel and height map approaches that is expressive enough to allow creating complex terrains with caves, overhangs, cliffs and arches, and efficient enough to allow terrain editing, deformations and rendering in real-time. We also explore how to apply lighting, texturing, shadowing and level-of-detail to the proposed <b>terrain</b> <b>representation.</b> Koca, ÇetinM. S...|$|E

The developed system represents a terrain surface by controlling the shape of a stretchable screen using 64 actuators (8 × 8) and by projecting an aerial photograph on a screen. In applying TTRS to highway route planning, the user establishes control points using a magnetic positioning device and projects the image of a highway alignment on the TTRS.

40|$|For several years, {{our group}} has {{developed}} a Digital Terrain Model based on irregularly distributed points connected into a sheet of triangular facets. Our first motive for this research stems from problems with traditional <b>terrain</b> <b>representations</b> which were recognized as early as 1967 by Boehm. Topographic surfaces are non-stationary (Pike and R-ozema, 1975), i. e., the roughness of the terrain is not periodic but changes from one landtype to another. A regular grid therefore has to be adjusted to the roughest terrain in the mod'el and be highly redundant in smooth terrain.

As an augmentation to field training, the author identifies {{a need for}} an easily available light infantry platoon combat model that presents a realistic view of the battlefield environment. To meet this need, the author examines the feasibility of developing a realistic three dimensional display of a <b>terrain</b> <b>representation</b> on a personal computer. The target computer provides only limited graphics support with an Enhanced Graphics Adapter and all graphics routines are implemented in software. Three methods of <b>terrain</b> <b>representation</b> are examined, and the Dynamic Tactical Simulation (DYNTACS) terrain model is chosen for implementation. The DYNTACS representation uses a specialized triangle drawing procedure written in assembly language, the painter's algorithm for hidden surface removal, and Defense Mapping Agency Digital Terrain Elevation Data.

This work considers the problem of predicting the attitude and configuration angles of the platform from <b>terrain</b> <b>representations</b> that are often incomplete due to occlusions and sensor limitations. Using Gaussian Processes (GP) and exteroceptive data as training input, we can provide a continuous and complete <b>representation</b> of <b>terrain</b> traversability, with uncertainty in the output estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that focuses on exploiting the explicit correlation in vehicle attitude and configuration during operation by learning a kernel function from vehicle experience to perform GP regression. We provide an extensive experimental validation of the proposed method on a planetary rover. We show significant improvement in the accuracy of our estimation compared with results obtained using standard kernels (Squared Exponential and Neural Network), and compared to traversability estimation made over terrain models built using state-of-the-art GP techniques...|$|R
