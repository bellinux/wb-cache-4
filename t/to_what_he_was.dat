500|$|During the off-season, {{the owners}} of the Cleveland Spiders {{purchased}} the St. Louis Browns from Chris von der Ahe. They changed the team name to Perfectos, and inherited their players. In early 1899, Stivetts claimed interest in playing for the St. Louis franchise if his salary were equal <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid with Boston. The new owners, to maximize their assets, transferred all the best players to St. Louis, while sending the rest, including Stivetts, to Cleveland. The Spiders released Stivetts on June13, and he subsequently retired from playing baseball. In 18 games for the Spiders, Stivetts had a [...]205batting average and a 0–4W–L record. He was claimed by St. Paul of the Western League a few days later, but did not play a game for the team. In his 11-season career, Stivetts won 203 games against 132 losses, a 3.74 ERA, and 1223 strikeouts in 2887innings pitched. In addition to his 35career home runs as a hitter, he collected 593hits in 1992 at bats for a [...]298batting average, and had 357RBIs.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{some of its}} most negative reviews from the British and Irish press. A review for NME was critical of the album's personal lyrics, and claimed that Manson had emasculated himself by opening up. In a one-star review, The Guardian called the album unconvincing, and criticized it for a lack of experimentation; whilst Entertainment.ie writer Lauren Murphy chastised several songs for sounding too experimental and [...] "completely misplaced", summarizing: [...] "If he'd stuck <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> good at – ear-piercing yelps, liberal dashes of real controversy and big, brawny metal songs with tough beats – he may have [...] a 'comeback' on his hands." [...] Conversely, Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy commended the album for its diversity, but was critical of its length and [...] "ill-advised attempts at stadium anthems." [...] He awarded the album three stars out of five and said: [...] "It's far from awful, but not for the first time, you can't help but feel that Manson could do so much better." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Peter Taylor, who was by now assistant manager of Watford, Hessenthaler was signed by the Hertfordshire club for a transfer fee of £65,000 {{at the beginning of}} the 1991–92 season. He opted to make the move even though becoming a full-time professional player would mean taking a drop in earnings compared <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> making combining semi-professional football with building work. His professional debut was against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park on 17 September 1991, and, despite having made a move of four divisions up the English football league system, he immediately established himself as a regular at Vicarage Road, making 35 Football League appearances in his first season. In five seasons with the Hornets, he made 217 appearances in total, scoring 14 goals, and also served as the team's captain. Watford fans voted Hessenthaler as runner-up for the club's Player of the Season award in four consecutive seasons between 1992 and 1995, and fondly remember him for his workrate and all-round ability. He was one of the club veterans selected to represent Watford in the 2006 London Masters football event, where he was named [...] "Player of the Tournament".|$|E

500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome, saying, [...] "We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too and I like the finished result". Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward {{came up with the idea}} for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, [...] "I thought it would be fun to wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up... I didn't bank on the fact that I'd also get loads of letters from their fathers saying 'Cool School uniform!'".|$|E
500|$|On November 8, 2012, DC {{announced}} that Hellblazer would be cancelled following its 300th issue, {{and would be}} replaced by Constantine written by Robert Venditti and drawn by Renato Guedes starring the younger New 52 John Constantine, rather than the version from Hellblazer, depicted as being in his late 50s. The Constantine series ended its run with its 23rd issue in May 2015. Nonetheless, the character would again star in another solo series entitled Constantine: The Hellblazer, written by Ming Doyle and art by Riley Rossmo, and released in June 10, 2015. Writer Ming Doyle expressed excitement in her chance to write Constantine, stating that the reason of putting the term Hellblazer back to the character's title was to [...] "take Constantine back <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at the start." [...] On July 20, 2016 a new comic book entitled The Hellblazer: Rebirth was released {{that was part of}} the DC Rebirth, a major relaunch in an effort to return famous DC stories from before the New 52 back into the reboot. The plot concerns John Constantine finally returning to London after being cursed by a demon that forced him to leave the city. Former Hellblazer characters such as Chas Chandler and Mercury made appearances in the series, and the comic was written by Simon Oliver who previously wrote the spin-off series [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1808, Cuvier {{identified}} a fossil found in Maastricht {{as a giant}} marine reptile that would later be named Mosasaurus. He also identified, from a drawing, another fossil found in Bavaria as a flying reptile and named it Pterodactylus. He speculated, based on the strata in which these fossils were found, that large reptiles had lived prior <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> calling [...] "the age of mammals". Cuvier's speculation would be supported {{by a series of}} finds that would be made in Great Britain {{over the course of the}} next two decades. Mary Anning, a professional fossil collector since age eleven, collected the fossils of a number of marine reptiles from the Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis. These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized as such, which was collected in 1811, and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found in 1821 and 1823. Many of her discoveries would be described scientifically by the geologists William Conybeare, Henry De la Beche, and William Buckland. It was Anning who observed that stony objects known as [...] "bezoar stones" [...] were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons, and she noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. This led her to suggest to Buckland that they were fossilized feces, which he named coprolites, and which he used to better understand ancient food chains.|$|E

500|$|To this day, Reagan's {{role in the}} {{transactions}} is not definitively known; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. Oliver North wrote that [...] "Ronald Reagan knew of and approved {{a great deal of}} what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it.

500|$|... "Machine Gun" [...] {{is another}} song that Hendrix had {{spent more time}} developing. [...] By the Fillmore East concerts, it became an {{extended}} guitar improvisational piece, which [...] "would completely change the perception of Hendrix's capabilities as an improviser and musician", according to Shadwick. [...] Although based on a [...] "minor drone-blues" [...] {{in the line of}} [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", Hendrix's performance has been compared to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's approach to improvisation. [...] Miles Davis, with whom Coltrane had recorded several albums in the 1950s, including the influential Kind of Blue, noted the connection: [...] "Jimi liked what I had done with Kind of Blue and some other stuff and wanted to add more jazz elements <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. [...] He liked the way Coltrane played with all those sheets of sound, and played his guitar in a similar way". [...] From Hendrix's dedication of the song [...] "to all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York, oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam", [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is as much about the late 1960s American race riots as the war in Vietnam. [...] Guitarist Vernon Reid describes it as [...] "like a movie about war without the visuals. [...] It had everything—the lyrics, the humanism of it, the drama of it, the violence of it, the eeriness of it, [...] the unpredictability of it". [...] In many commentaries about Band of Gypsys, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is singled out as the highlight of the album.

2500|$|According to Bischoff's {{autobiography}} Controversy Creates Cash, Time Warner increasingly micromanaged WCW, severely hindering (and occasionally overriding) Bischoff's {{control of}} the company. Time Warner initially gave him slight restrictions as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> and {{was not allowed to}} do with WCW. The restrictions mounted as time passed, with impending lawsuits between the WWF and WCW adding more. By the summer of 1998, he was outright ordered to alter WCW's format to a more [...] "family-friendly" [...] output. The forced shift in WCW's programming came while the WWF, buoyed by its new [...] "Attitude" [...] branding and product, was regularly beating an increasingly stagnant WCW week after week in the Monday night ratings war. Also, Time Warner had ordered WCW (like the other companies under Time Warner ownership) to slash their budget, putting even more strain on the company. As it was common knowledge that many executives in WCW ownership — from the Turner-owned era to the AOL Time Warner years – hated the idea of wrestling on their stations and attempted to remove the company entirely, Bischoff maintains that the restrictions and mandates placed on WCW was done in order to accomplish and accelerate the promotion's demise.|$|E

2500|$|The poem {{according}} to Coleridge's account, is {{a fragment of}} what it should have been, amounting <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to jot down from memory: 54 lines. Originally, his dream included between 200 and 300 lines, but he was only able to compose the first 30 before he was interrupted. The second stanza is not necessarily {{part of the original}} dream and refers to the dream in the past tense. The rhythm of the poem, like its themes and images, is different from other poems Coleridge wrote during the time, and it is organised in a structure similar to 18th-century odes. The poem relies on many sound-based techniques, including cognate variation and chiasmus. In particular, the poem emphasises the use of the [...] "æ" [...] sound and similar modifications to the standard [...] "a" [...] sound to make the poem sound Asian. Its rhyme scheme found in the first seven lines is repeated in the first seven lines of the second stanza. There is a heavy use of assonance, the reuse of vowel sounds, and a reliance on alliteration, repetition of the first sound of a word, within the poem including the first line: [...] "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan". The stressed sounds, [...] "Xan", [...] "du", [...] "Ku", [...] "Khan", contain assonance in their use of the sounds a-u-u-a, have two rhyming syllables with [...] "Xan" [...] and [...] "Khan", and employ alliteration with the name [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] and the reuse of [...] "d" [...] sounds in [...] "Xanadu" [...] and [...] "did". To pull the line together, the [...] "i" [...] sound of [...] "In" [...] is repeated in [...] "did". Later lines do not contain the same amount of symmetry but do rely on assonance and rhymes throughout. The only word that has no true connection to another word is [...] "dome" [...] except in its use of a [...] "d" [...] sound. Though the lines are interconnected, the rhyme scheme and line lengths are irregular.|$|E
