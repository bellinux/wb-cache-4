However, when Gowariker decided to start filming What's Your Raashee?, Rahman was busy with other projects including Slumdog Millionaire (2008). Gowariker wanted thirteen songs for the film, but Rahman {{did not have time}} to compose them, and they agreed not to work together on the film. The director revealed {{that he did not want}} another established composer because [...] "he wanted someone <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> on this film for several months."

Additional successful [...] "reunion" [...] concerts followed over the years, becoming more frequent as time passed, with Tim Ryan also filling the spot left by Terry Robinson. Band members also organized a 2012 tribute concert to the Montana band. M2WB now plays semi-regular performances, including some out-of-state in locations such as Lake Tahoe. In 2005 they released their entire recorded output in a box set entitled Private Stash, which included music, DVD recordings of performances, and cover art by Monte Dolack. The band {{was the subject of}} a 2009 PBS documentary, [...] "Never Long Gone: The Mission Mountain Wood Band Story." [...] That year, they also opened for John Fogerty at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The band added singer and songwriter Tim Ryan to the group to fill the position once held by Robinson. They released a new studio album called Reboot in 2011 with a tour in support, and in 2014 a second new album, Now and Then. [...] Though all members continue to play music, only Ryan and Quist individually continue <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> as musicians, Quist with Great Northern and later with his adult children Guthrie and Halladay in a band they called House of Quist.

Novak later described his academic achievements as [...] "very uneven." [...] He spoke at the university's May 1998 commencement, and in his speech he credited the college for bringing him up from working class immigrant status into the American middle class.|$|E

50|$|Karin Weber von Hartz was a {{part-time}} worker, {{who had worked}} for 15 years at Bilka-Kaufhaus. She was refused pension payments under her contract with her employer Bilka-Kaufhaus, which required her <b>to</b> have <b>worked</b> <b>full</b> <b>time</b> for 15 years. She had a German state pension, on top, however. She claimed this was sex discrimination under the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (TEEC) art icle119 (now TFEU art 157). She alleged that women work more part-time, so they are at a disadvantage. Bilka-Kaufhaus argued it was justified in excluding part-time workers because there are higher administrative costs for giving pensions to part-time workers, given the work they do. They also said 81.3 per cent of all occupational pensions were paid to women, even though only 72% of employees were women, so the scheme was unrelated to sex discrimination.|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we set up}} the microeconometric {{model of}} labour supply behaviour. We present an {{approach}} where taxes and transfers are explicitly taken into account. This extension of the standard labour supply model leads to the specification of a probit model that relates labour participation probabilities to the gains <b>to</b> <b>work</b> from working <b>full</b> <b>time,</b> non-labour income, and other individual characteristics. Finally, we show that participation elasticities can be derived analytically when using this methodology.|$|R
