5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating <b>to</b> <b>Matter</b> and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E

25|$|This {{includes}} {{cases in}} which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the transfer of matter and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable <b>to</b> <b>matter,</b> between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy transferred with the transfer of matter is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.|$|E

25|$|Bohm's {{proposed}} implicate order applies both <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> and consciousness. He {{suggested that}} it could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order. Bohm claimed that {{when we look at}} matter, we see nothing that helps us to understand consciousness.|$|E
25|$|When two {{otherwise}} isolated {{bodies are}} connected {{together by a}} rigid physical path impermeable <b>to</b> <b>matter,</b> there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of them. Eventually they reach a state of mutual thermal equilibrium, in which heat transfer has ceased, and the bodies' respective state variables have settled to become unchanging.|$|E
25|$|The {{archetype}} was {{not merely}} a psychic entity, but more fundamentally, a bridge <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> in general. Jung used the term unus mundus to describe the unitary reality which he believed underlay all manifest phenomena. He conceived archetypes to be the mediators of the unus mundus, organizing not only ideas in the psyche, but also the fundamental principles of matter and energy in the physical world.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle applies {{his theory}} of hylomorphism to living things. He defines a soul as that which makes a living thing alive. Life is a {{property}} of living things, just as knowledge and health are. Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a living thing. Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form <b>to</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{testifying before}} Congress, both former DCIs John McCone and Richard Helms were {{informed}} beforehand by a CIA officer {{as to what}} documents Congress had been given and hence the probable contours of its knowledge. According to author Thomas Powers, both McCone and Helms could thus tailor their testimony so as to limit the scope of discussion <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> already known by the committee. Such stance of institutional loyalty to their agency showed through in their demeanor.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, a {{conditional}} correspondence exists. There {{are three}} relevant kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable <b>to</b> <b>matter.</b> If {{two of those}} kinds of wall are sealed off, leaving only one that permits transfers of energy, as work, as heat, or with matter, then the remaining permitted terms correspond precisely. If two of the kinds of wall are left unsealed, then energy transfer can be shared between them, so that the two remaining permitted terms do not correspond precisely.|$|E
25|$|Newton {{had also}} {{specifically}} attributed the inherent power of inertia <b>to</b> <b>matter,</b> against the mechanist thesis that matter has no inherent powers. But whereas Newton vehemently denied gravity was an inherent power of matter, his collaborator Roger Cotes made gravity also an inherent power of matter, as {{set out in}} his famous preface to the Principia's 1713 second edition which he edited, and contradicted Newton himself. And it was Cotes's interpretation of gravity rather than Newton's that came to be accepted.|$|E

His innings, which contained 3 chances, lasted for just under 7 hours. England scored 353. England lacked a fast bowler, but that seemed not <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> as Australia were bowled out cheaply for 121 and 126, with Johnny Briggs taking 11 for 74. England won by an innings and 106 runs.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} fusing horizons {{serves as a}} guiding model for {{therapeutic}} dialogue. Furthermore, this process necessitates {{the need for the}} therapist to allow what the client says <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> to him and even challenge what he believes. Instead of the therapist assuming the role of expert, he rids himself of any therapist hubris and shares authority with the client, therefore allowing for safe conversation and critical openness toward both counselor and client. By both remaining open, horizons from each party are mutually influenced.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of energy between an open {{system and a}} single contiguous subsystem of its surroundings is considered also in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The problem of definition arises also in this case. It may be allowed that the wall between the system and the subsystem is not only permeable <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> and to internal energy, but also may be movable so as to allow {{work to be done}} when the two systems have different pressures. In this case, the {{transfer of}} energy as heat is not defined.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{memory is}} not always {{accurate}} and can be misled by outside conditions. This {{can be seen in}} studies carried out by Elizabeth Loftus and Gary Wells. In one study by Wells, individuals were exposed to misleading information after witnessing an event; they were then tested on their ability to remember details from this event. Their findings included: when given misinformation that contradicts the witnessed event they were less able to recall those details; and whether misinformation was given before or after the witnessed event did not seem <b>to</b> <b>matter.</b> Furthermore, visual memory can be subjected to various memory errors which will affect accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{alternative}} therapies and interventions are available, ranging from elimination diets to chelation therapy. Few {{are supported by}} scientific studies. Treatment approaches lack empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Even {{if they do not}} help, conservative treatments such as changes in diet are expected to be harmless aside from their bother and cost. Dubious invasive treatments are a much more serious matter: for example, in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old boy with autism.|$|E
25|$|Presently, no semiclassical limit {{recovering}} {{general relativity}} {{has been shown}} to exist. This means it remains unproven that LQG's description of spacetime at the Planck scale has the right continuum limit (described by general relativity with possible quantum corrections). Specifically, the dynamics of the theory is encoded in the Hamiltonian constraint, but there is no candidate Hamiltonian. Other technical problems include finding off-shell closure of the constraint algebra and physical inner product vector space, coupling <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> fields of Quantum field theory, fate of the renormalization of the graviton in perturbation theory that lead to ultraviolet divergence beyond 2-loops (see One-loop Feynman diagram in Feynman diagram).|$|E
