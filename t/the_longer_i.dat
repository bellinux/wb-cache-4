Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>I</b> look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
2500|$|.....In the {{beginning}} of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. [...] Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>I</b> live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that [...] "except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it." [...] I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:... I therefore beg leave to move—that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that {{one or more of the}} Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.|$|E
2500|$|Plato, in The Republic, {{numbered}} Simonides with Bias and Pittacus {{among the}} wise and blessed, even putting {{into the mouth}} of Socrates the words [...] "it is not easy to disbelieve Simonides, for he is a wise man and divinely inspired," [...] but in his dialogue Protagoras, Plato numbered Simonides with Homer and Hesiod as precursors of the sophist. A number of apocryphal sayings were attributed to him. Michael Psellos accredited him with [...] "the word is the image of the thing." [...] Plutarch commended [...] "the saying of Simonides, that he had often felt sorry after speaking but never after keeping silent" [...] and observed that [...] "Simonides calls painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks" [...] (later paraphrased by the Latin poet Horace as ut pictura poesis). Diogenes Laertius, after quoting a famous epigram by Cleobulus (one of ancient Greece's 'seven sages') in which a maiden sculptured on a tomb is imagined to proclaim her eternal vigilance, quotes Simonides commenting on it in a poem of his own: [...] "Stone is broken even by mortal hands. That was the judgement of a fool." [...] His rationalist view of the cosmos is evinced also in Plutarch's letter of consolation to Apollonius:"according to Simonides a thousand or ten thousand years are an undeterminable point, or rather the tiniest part of a point." [...] Cicero related how, when Hieron of Syracuse asked him to define god, Simonides continually postponed his reply, [...] "because <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>I</b> deliberate, the more obscure the matter seems to me." [...] Stobaeus recorded this reply to a man who had confided in Simonides some unflattering things he had heard said about him: [...] "Please stop slandering me with your ears!".|$|E

Pettit described his technique as follows: [...] "My star trail images are made by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes. However, with modern digital cameras, 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible, due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image. To achieve <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> exposures <b>I</b> do what many amateur astronomers do.

40|$|This paper reexamines, at a {{range of}} {{investment}} horizons, the asymmetric dependence between hedge fund returns and market returns. Given the current availability of hedge fund data, the joint distribution of longer-horizon returns is extracted from the dynamics of monthly returns using the filtered historical simulation; we then apply the method based on copula theory to uncover the dependence structure therein. While the direction of asym-metry remains unchanged, the magnitude of asymmetry is attenuated considerably as the investment horizon increases. Similar horizon effects also occur on the tail dependence. Our findings suggest that nonlinearity in hedge fund exposure to market risk is more short term in nature, and that hedge funds provide higher benefits of diversification, <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> horizon. <b>I...</b>|$|R
