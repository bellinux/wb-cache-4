On numerous occasions vandals damaged the Charterhouse, eventually demolishing its buildings.

5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected to continue in the future.

International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E

Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> the individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|Conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan first {{appeared}} in 2006, when Azeri media criticized the event's website for listing Nagorno-Karabakh as the birthplace of Armenia's first representative, André, as {{it was part of}} the Azerbaijan SSR at the time. Conflicts notably escalated throughout the 2009 contest: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument We Are Our Mountains during an introductory video for the Armenian entry. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had tampered with its feed of the broadcast to censor the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security. Following an inquiry, Azerbaijan was fined by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for breaching <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> voters.|$|E
5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous series. Housemates were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to spend on their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted in <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, Big Brother changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother.|$|E

25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> {{their own}} homes, {{people are more}} casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably.

The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
