5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies.

Mulder reviews the video of the session, and is convinced that <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be}} a fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning.

5|$|The player, as Yumetaro, must {{venture into}} the {{alternate}} dimension to rescue his new owner. The player character can jump and spawn stars above the horn on his head. The star is a central mechanic to the game, being necessary to defeat enemies found while also doubling as a platform, capable of being ridden to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The player must make their way through six stages and six bosses to complete the game. Once the sixth boss is defeated, it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> still missing and the game restarts from the beginning. To truly complete Gimmick!, the player must find a hidden area in each stage where a magic item resides. If one can obtain each all the magic items without losing every life (i.e. using no continues), a secret stage will appear in which an extra boss must be beaten. Only after this boss is defeated is the game completed in full, with a cutscene showing Yumetaro rescuing the girl and leading {{her back to the}} real world.|$|E
