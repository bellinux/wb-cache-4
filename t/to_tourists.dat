This research indicates that measures of accessibility should include not only commonly used factors such as socio-demographic variables and distance, but also the facilities available at various attractions, management and operational aspects relating to the attraction (what we term "functions"), and the infrastructure used to move between specific attractions (what we term "connectivity of networks"). A case study of the Ningaloo Coast region was conducted to identify individual difference in evaluation of accessibility <b>to</b> <b>tourist</b> attractions.

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors <b>to</b> <b>tourists.</b> This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
