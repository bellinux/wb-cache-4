Indians manager Lee Fohl {{said at the}} time, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make him a good pitcher. He already has learned to put more on his fast ball while his control is almost perfect." [...] He made his debut on May 20, 1916, {{pitching}} one inning and allowing one hit, one base on balls, and two earned runs. Des Jardien did not pitch another game in Major League Baseball. In the summer of 1917, Des Jardien played semi-professional baseball with the Mohawks in the Chicago League.|$|E

[...] "The words of a President have an enormous weight," [...] he would later write, [...] "and {{ought not to be}} used indiscriminately." [...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," [...] he once told Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of his}} son in 1924.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released in 1990. Though the film had received critical acclaim over the years, its commercial failure had devastated his father, producer Yash Johar. The idea of a possible remake materialised on the sets of Johar's directorial My Name Is Khan, in which Karan Malhotra was an assistant director. Johar told Malhotra of his desire to remake the original film {{and asked him to}} revisit it again. On not directing the film himself, Johar commented, [...] "I am happy directing films on love, romance and drama. That's what I do best. I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> be good at an action film. So I am not taking the reins of the film in my hand".|$|E

500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1958 and 1961 Ōe {{published}} {{a series of}} works incorporating sexual metaphors for the occupation of Japan. He summarised the common theme of these stories as [...] "the relationship of a foreigner as the big power , a Japanese who {{is more or less}} placed in a humiliating position , and, sandwiched between the two, the third party [...] (sometimes a prostitute who caters only to foreigners or an interpreter)". In each of these works, the Japanese X is inactive, failing to take the initiative to resolve the situation and showing no psychological or spiritual development. The graphically sexual nature of this group of stories prompted a critical outcry; Ōe said of the culmination of the series Our Times, [...] "I personally like this novel [...] I do not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> ever write another novel which is filled only with sexual words." ...|$|E

He qualified second, led the first nine laps, and finished third when the race was called after 79 of 92 laps. Three weeks later he followed this with an 11th-place finish after a mid-race spin at the Sam's Town 250 at Memphis Motorsports Park, his first appearance in NASCAR's second division Busch Series. He competed in the final three races of the Busch Series season, but did not better this performance. He would later run 17 Busch Series races on a part-time schedule the following year. On November 19, 2006, Montoya competed for the first time in NASCAR's premier division, the NEXTEL Cup Series. He qualified 29th in the No. 30 Texaco car at the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
