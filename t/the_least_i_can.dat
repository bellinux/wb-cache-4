2500|$|In February 2001, Markhasev sent {{a letter}} to California Deputy Attorney General Kyle Brodie asking that all appeals in his case stop. Markhasev wrote to Brodie that he had killed Cosby and that he wanted {{to do the right thing}} by confessing. [...] "Although my appeal is in its {{beginning}} stages, I don't want to continue with it because it's based on falsehood and deceit," [...] wrote Markhasev, who is incarcerated at California State Prison, Corcoran. [...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right thing ... More than anything, I want to apologize to the victim's family. It is my duty as a Christian, and it's <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, after the great wickedness for which I am responsible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson {{regarding}} Alabama, that [...] "I am {{attempting to}} do <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do safely without upsetting the civil rights groups." [...] Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the [...] "high-visibility" [...] election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists. With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office. Clark later was prosecuted and convicted of drug smuggling and served a prison sentence. The US Civil Rights Commission said that the murders of activists, such as Jonathan Daniels in 1965, had been a major impediment to voter registration.|$|E

6000|$|... "I shall install {{myself as}} head nurse," [...] Mrs. Conyers said, decidedly. [...] "We owe {{so much to}} you all, that that is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good many. I don't know. I am {{horrified to}} look back on it, and <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do after it is to come to you like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you've {{elevated}} me to a princedom, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is {{to invite}} you down home for a week-end--down to the San Spirito Presidio. My father's commandant there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I realize that. I {{am quite}} a {{stranger}} to you. Nevertheless, my gratitude is your due and I hope you will accept it as <b>the</b> <b>least</b> tribute <b>I</b> <b>can</b> pay you. Of all that throng of bathers, only you noticed my peril and came to my assistance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{much longer}} before you can do so again, if I {{go back to the}} Islands with papa. I shall expect you to be true, you know; and it will be ten years at <b>the</b> <b>least</b> before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hope to be home again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{to worry}} about. I shall {{take a little}} watching, but I shan't have to do {{anything}} dreadful, or even, in <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> inconvenient. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do in fact as I like." [...] It was wonderful for Milly how just to put it so made all its pieces fall at present quite properly into places.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{do is to}} take it myself," [...] said Geoffrey, smiling to {{hide his}} uneasiness. [...] "I presume you do not wish me to swallow it immediately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{ought to}} have married your mother if anybody. And as I have not married her, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do in respect to her is to marry no other woman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} that once. And you had set your heart on that pendant. Surely to goodness, if I drag {{you away from}} a {{comfortable}} home {{to live in a}} hovel, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is to----" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{glanced at}} Miss Townshead, who, though she wished to, {{could not quite}} check a smile. He was very young, and had a pleasant face. [...] "That was very kind of you," [...] he said. [...] "Now, <b>I</b> think <b>the</b> <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is to retire to the barn or stable.

6000|$|... 'Why--very troubled; oh yes--but his {{was like}} some bird of prey. Yours--what mad stuff {{to talk like}} this!--not <b>the</b> <b>least</b> symptom, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see, of--why, the [...] "prey," [...] you know.' ...|$|R

60|$|Ozm. Ah, cruel father, {{what do you}} propose!

6000|$|... "My good lady, I am hungry, very hungry, indeed; {{and if your}} master, I mean Mr. von, that is Mr. Beckendorff, {{has such}} a bad {{appetite}} that he can satisfy himself with picking, once a day, the breast of a pheasant; why, if he expect his friends to be willing or even able to live on such fare, <b>the</b> <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say is, that he is much mistaken; and so, therefore, my good friend Grey, I think we had better order our horses and be off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't have blamed you either, you know. Most men after a bump {{like that}} might have been spiteful. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is to stand you a needle and thread. And a clothes brush. It isn't {{everyone}} who'd have taken it like you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} their outfit upon myself, Francis," [...] the earl said. [...] "My steward shall {{go out with}} them and see to it. It is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do when I am abetting you in depriving my old tutor of his sons." ...|$|E

I want to state publicly and unequivocally that I am in {{sympathy with the}} IRA - indeed sympathy is too weak a word ... I cannot join them {{in the fight for}} freedom of my country, but <b>the</b> very <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is speak up for them when they are being slandered and vilified by unscrupulously vicious propaganda. The oppressors of Irish freedom call the IRA terrorists and murderers, but I call them by their proper titles; I call them freedom fighters, I call them heroes; and I venerate their dead as martyrs for Ireland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} <b>the</b> <b>least</b> idea, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> try; {{and if you}} hit the other one, the chances are he'll bolt, whether I hit him or not.

6000|$|... "Turning {{the lock}} of the door, is he?" [...] said Allan, {{as soon as}} his merriment left him breath enough to speak. [...] "That's a devilish unhandsome action, Master Midwinter, on the part of your ghost. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, after that, is to let mine out of the cabin, and give him the run of the ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} you respect me," [...] she began; [...] "I {{am going to}} prove that I believe you. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do is not to misinterpret you, on my side.

"You're a gentleman, Don Miguel Briones; and <b>the</b> <b>least</b> respect <b>I</b> <b>can</b> show {{a man of}} {{your kind}} is not to pretend that I don't {{understand}} the sacrifice you're making.

But {{as the man who}} ran that bigger risk isn't here to speak for himself, and generally trusts his wife, Susan Markham, to speak for him--it's all the same as if HE thanked you. There's my hand, Don Miguel: shake it. Well--if you prefer it--kiss it then. There--don't be a fool--but let's go back to Miss Keene." ...|$|R
