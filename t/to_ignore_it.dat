5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it.</b> Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it</b> until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E

This indeterminacy {{is reduced to}} the indeterminacy of indirect speech and implicature, on which irony entirely and humor, at least largely, rely. The “performance ” of humor and irony is investigated by examining the motivations for Ss to use irony and the responses that Hs produce to it, which range from mode adoption <b>to</b> <b>ignoring</b> <b>it</b> (deliberately or not) ...|$|R

25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding.

25|$|Coburn, {{together}} with {{senior members of}} the Family, attempted to intervene to end Ensign's affair in February 2008, before the affair became public, including by meeting with the husband of Ensign's mistress and encouraging Ensign to write a letter to his mistress breaking off the affair. Ensign was driven to Federal Express from C Street Center to post the letter, shortly after which Ensign called to tell his mistress <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Coordinadora Democrática, {{led by the}} {{business}} federation Fedecámaras and the trade union federation Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV), called for a fourth paro cívico, {{which turned out to}} be the most serious, and is known as the 2002–2003 oil lockout/strike, to begin on 2 December 2002. The opposition also called a recall-referendum-petition-signature-gathering day for 4 December. Initially the strike had a mixed response, with affluent eastern Caracas seeing most shops closed, while downtown and western Caracas was busy; many business owners either supported Chávez or put their business above politics. Early attempts to block a crucial navigation channel in Lake Maracaibo, in order to paralyse the oil industry, were foiled by the navy. The National Electoral Council voted to hold a non-binding recall referendum on 2 February, but the Coordinadora Democrática chose <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it.</b> On 4 December the captain of a large oil tanker named for the beauty queen Pilín León anchored in the Lake Maracaibo shipping channel and refused to move. The rest of PDVSA 13-ship fleet was quickly similarly grounded. Combined with the PDVSA management walkout, this effectively paralysed the Venezuelan oil industry.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{contract was}} for the game be completed within 18 months. In the course of its development, the game was nearly canceled twice: {{in the first instance}} due to the company's financial difficulties, and the second time under the pressure from Spectrum HoloByte after it had acquired Bill Stealey’s shares in MicroProse in 1993. Julian Gollop said the quality assurance team (Andrew Lucket, Phil McDonnel, and Jason Thompson) helped save the game from cancellation; their feedback also helped to polish the game. The game was in fact officially ordered to be canceled by Spectrum HoloByte, but MicroProse UK bosses Pete Moreland, Adrian Parr, and Paul Hibbard held a meeting and decided <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it</b> and simply not inform Gollop about any of that. Thus, the development team continued their work without any knowledge of the parent company's executives, until it was eventually completed in March 1994, after 30 months in development since the initial contract. During the final three months, after Spectrum HoloByte was eventually informed of the game still being in production, the Gollop brothers were forced to work 7–12 in order to finish it {{before the end of the}} fiscal year. The overall development of the PC version cost £115,000.|$|E

500|$|On July 28, Japanese papers {{reported}} that the declaration had been rejected by the Japanese government.

The statement was taken by both Japanese and foreign papers as a clear rejection of the declaration. Emperor Hirohito, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to non-committal Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position. Japan's willingness to surrender remained conditional on the preservation of the imperial institution; that Japan not be occupied; that the Japanese armed forces be disbanded voluntarily; and that war criminals be prosecuted by Japanese courts.|$|E

500|$|Though docking {{is often}} {{considered}} cruel and unnatural by animal rights activists, {{it is considered}} by sheep producers large and small alike to be a critical step in maintaining the health of sheep. [...] Long, wooly tails make shearing more difficult, interfere with mating, and make sheep extremely susceptible to parasites, especially those that cause flystrike. Both castration and docking can be performed with several instruments. An elastrator places a tight band of rubber around an area, causing it to atrophy and fall off {{in a number of}} weeks. This process is bloodless and does not seem to cause extended suffering to lambs, who tend <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it</b> after several hours. In addition to the elastrator, a Burdizzo, emasculator, heated chisel or knife are sometimes used. After one to three days in the lambing jugs, ewes and lambs are usually sufficiently stabilized to allow reintroduction {{to the rest of the}} flock.|$|E

In a phone call with her father and a journal entry, Medium Alison expresses her anxiety about starting college ("Not Too Bad").

500|$|Walt Whitman {{is often}} {{described}} as America’s national poet, creating an image of America for itself. [...] "Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, {{and the rest of the}} world in a subordinate position." [...] In his study, [...] "The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>it,</b> should look again at Whitman’s nationalism: “Whitman’s seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States … [...] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away” (xv-xvi). Nathanael O’Reilly in an essay on [...] "Walt Whitman’s Nationalism in the First Edition of Leaves of Grass" [...] claims that [...] "Whitman’s imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights." [...] Whitman's imaginative [...] "mawkish" [...] nationalism avoided issues concerning the genocide of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay [...] "Racial attitudes","Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche." [...] The authors concluded their essay with: ...|$|E
