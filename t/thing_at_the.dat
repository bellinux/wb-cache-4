25|$|Palmerston {{was a great}} orator. His {{language}} was relatively unstudied and his delivery somewhat embarrassed, but he generally found words to say the right <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right time and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience.

Pepys's diary is one of the only known sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper middle class man during the seventeenth century.|$|E

If Jessica never happened, then Ashlee doesn't get her own show and this album doesn't happen." [...] Zena Burns of Teen People, while noting the importance of effective promotion and Simpson's connection to Jessica, stressed the appeal of [...] "Pieces of Me" [...] in explaining her success: [...] "Ashlee has an amazing promotional machine, and it doesn't hurt to have Jessica and MTV behind you, but she also came out with an insanely catchy pop single." [...] From July 13 to July 20, the week prior to Autobiographys release, MTV.com's [...] "The Leak" [...] featured the album for streaming on its website. Autobiography drew 2.66 million requested streams during the time period, breaking a record previously held by Britney Spears' 2003 album In the Zone.|$|E

I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it.

They're all their own stories {{and they all have}} their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward a big <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series.

500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the Yellow Eyes, was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing <b>thing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling {{to get out of bed}} or walk down a hallway ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to cover half his face and most of his chest and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes.|$|E
500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, {{as it might}} be, and I think that's an ongoing <b>thing</b> ... <b>At</b> <b>the</b> moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also states that he feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I like seeing them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E
