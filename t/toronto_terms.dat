Between 1980 and 1990 the region’s external debt more than tripled, to US$ 171 billion, while debt service payments and rescheduling rose by more than 150 percent to US$ 20 billion. In addition, the region continues to qualify as severely debt-distressed. During {{the last few years}} the region has benefitted from several new debt initiatives, including a substantial increase in debt cancellation by bilateral creditors and the general application of <b>Toronto</b> <b>terms</b> for debt rescheduling. There are also proposals for further debt assistance, including more liberal rescheduling terms, broader debt forgiveness, and consolidating debt relief and aid generation activities.

5000|$|One of the {{precursors}} to a [...] "moblog" [...] was {{the development of}} a wearable photographic device by Steve Mann of the University of <b>Toronto.</b> <b>Termed</b> [...] "domewear," [...] the intention was for human rights workers to wear the devices to take photographic and video evidence of dangerous situations while avoiding being targeted for using traditional cameras. The first recorded example of moblogging was on 1995 February 22, when Steve Mann posted text from his wearable mobile computer to his weblog server, together with video (image sequence). The term moblogging, however, wasn't coined until 2002, by Adam Greenfield. Mobile devices have expanded beyond basic communication and now these devices can support multimedia creation tools.|$|R

5000|$|The Rosedale Gang is {{the name}} {{used to refer to}} the group of {{individuals}} that advise Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff. The term pokes fun at the fact that many from this group were either born or have worked in Toronto prior to joining Ignatieff's Ottawa team. Rosedale is a wealthy, old money neighbourhood in <b>Toronto.</b> The <b>term</b> 'Rosedale Gang' first appeared in a Toronto Star story which credited the term to an anonymous source within the Liberal party.

2500|$|It was 1988 that [...] "Goth" [...] {{arrived in}} <b>Toronto.</b> The <b>term</b> [...] "Goth" [...] {{began to be}} used to refer to those [...] "freaks" [...] who centred on Gothic fashion and Gothic rock. Elsewhere, merely being a fan of Gothic rock would {{generally}} define an individual as a [...] "Goth", but {{this was not the case}} in Toronto, where the idea of being [...] "Gothic" [...] was taken very literally; until the mid '90s, the Goths in Toronto considered Gothic literature, romantic poetry, Gothic fashion and Gothic aesthetics, especially beauty, to be subcultural requirements as well. Anne Rice, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron, Bram Stoker and other Gothic romanticist authors were extensively read and considered social obligations. A new, darker vampire fashion became the default definition of Torontonian Goth style.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Toronto</b> Blessing, a <b>term</b> {{coined by}} British newspapers, {{describes}} the Christian revival and associated phenomena {{that began in}} January 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church (TAV), which was renamed in 1995 to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship (TACF) and then later in 2010 renamed to Catch the Fire Toronto. It is categorized as a neo-charismatic evangelical Christian church and is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The events that occurred at the Toronto Blessing yielded {{both positive and negative}} criticism about charismatic doctrine, the latter rain movement, and the types of physical responses that should be expected within a charismatic service. The Toronto Blessing also may have influenced other revivals, such as the Brownsville Revival and the Lakeland Revival where similar manifestations occurred.|$|R

5000|$|In another instance, Harold Ballard, {{owner of}} the Toronto Maple Leafs, {{deliberately}} made the <b>Toronto</b> Toros' lease <b>terms</b> at Maple Leaf Gardens as onerous as possible after they moved from Ottawa. The Toros were owned by John F. Bassett, son of Canadian media mogul John Bassett. The older Bassett had formerly been part-{{owner of the}} Leafs with Ballard and Stafford Smythe before falling out with his two partners. At the time the Toros' lease at Maple Leaf Gardens, Ballard was serving a lengthy prison term for fraud and tax evasion and unable to intervene, however, {{by the time the}} Toros played their first game, Ballard had been paroled and had regained control of the Gardens. Much to Bassett's outrage, the arena was dim for the first game. Ballard also ordered the cushions from the home bench removed for Toros' games (he told an arena worker, [...] "Let 'em buy their own cushions!"). It was obvious that Ballard was angered at the WHA being figuratively in his backyard, and took out his frustration with the renegade league on the Toros. These terms compelled Bassett to move the team to Birmingham.|$|R
40|$|Glen Lowry, in {{his paper}} 2 ̆ 2 The Representation of 2 ̆ 7 Race 2 ̆ 7 in Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s In the Skin of a Lion 2 ̆ 2 bases his {{discussion}} on the observation that critics tend to view Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s writing {{in terms of a}} progression towards complex issues of 2 ̆ 2 race 2 ̆ 2 and post-coloniality. In contrast, Lowry argues that the matter of 2 ̆ 2 race 2 ̆ 2 forms an integral aspect of Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s oeuvre and Lowry proposes that In the Skin of a Lion is a key site in the development of Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with issues of 2 ̆ 2 race 2 ̆ 2 and the cultural politics of post-coloniality. Focusing on Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s depiction of <b>Toronto</b> in <b>terms</b> of its complex history of shifting social spaces and his representation of Patrick and Caravaggio as 2 ̆ 2 racialized 2 ̆ 2 figures, Lowry discusses Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with whiteness as a social construct. Rather than critiquing Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s novel for an apparent absence of race-writing, i. e., writing about so-called 2 ̆ 2 visible minorities, 2 ̆ 2 Lowry suggests that Ondaatje in fact 2 ̆ 2 reverses the gaze 2 ̆ 2 and throws the question of 2 ̆ 2 race 2 ̆ 2 back on the readers. Adding the figures of Patrick and Caravaggio to the writing of the city, In the Skin of a Lion undermines presumptions about the racial stability and hegemonic power of Toronto 2 ̆ 7 s and ethnic communities. Last, Lowry argues for a more thorough discussion of Ondaatje 2 ̆ 7 s critique of nationalism and multiculturalism vis-à-vis the cultural politics of reading and the construction of 2 ̆ 2 whiteness. 2 ̆...|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} on Saint Helena of English parents in 1792. In 1820, he was named Receiver General and left for York (later <b>Toronto).</b> During Dunn's <b>term</b> in this post, an {{agreement}} regarding sharing of customs revenues between Upper and Lower Canada remained unresolved for some time, forcing him borrowing money from private lendors to finance government expenditures. In 1822, he {{was named to the}} province's Legislative Council. Dunn also {{served as president of the}} Welland Canal Company from 1825 to 1833 and helped to raise funds for the project from both public and private sources. In 1836, he was named to the Executive Council of Upper Canada. However, three weeks later, Dunn resigned with his fellow councillors when lieutenant governor Sir Francis Bond Head refused to take the advice of the council into account with respect to the governing of the province. He was named Receiver General for the newly formed Province of Canada in 1841 and was elected to represent Toronto in the Legislative Assembly in the same year. In 1843, he resigned from his post to protest Governor Metcalfe's refusal to consult the Executive Council on patronage appointments. After he was defeated in an attempt to gain reelection in 1844, he returned to England the following year with his family.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the needs of}} all offenders being released to Toronto during a three month period; July 1 to September 30, 1988. It's purpose is to identify any needs which may exist in <b>Toronto</b> both in <b>terms</b> of a need for halfway house beds and programming needs within the houses. From the data we gathered, we were able to conclude that there is currently no policy which requires that offenders be matched to halfway houses according to their individual needs. We also found that: (1) Mandatory Supervision cases are the highest in terms of risk and need, yet they receive the least structure release of all early releases. Day Parole releases, on the other hand, have the fewest needs and present the lowest risk, yet they receive the most structured form of release, with mandatory halfway house residence. (2) There is a lack of structured programming in Toronto halfway houses, and the programs which do exist are often duplicated, where other needs are not met through any type of programming. (3) There does appear to be a small shortage of beds for Day Parole releases and a great shortage of beds for Mandatory Supervision releases. From these conclusions we were able to make recommendations concerning release policy and how it relates to halfway houses. These recommendations are designed to make the release and treatment of offenders more cost effective as well as to reduce the chances of recidivism. They require both policy and legislative changes in order to be implemented. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
5000|$|The first Koreans {{to come to}} Canada were local Christians sent by Canadian missionaries as seminary students. Tae-yon Whang {{is largely}} {{regarded}} as the first recorded Korean immigrant to Canada. Whang visited Canada in 1948 as a mission-sponsored medical intern, and stayed in <b>Toronto</b> after his <b>term</b> was over. Unlike Korean Americans who have relatively much longer history settling in the United States, very few settled in Canada; as late as 1965, the total permanent Korean population of Canada was estimated at only 70. However, with the 1966 reform of Canadian immigration laws, South Korean immigration to Canada began to grow. By 1969, there were an estimated 2000 Koreans in Canada. [...] Between 1970 and 1980, 18,148 Koreans immigrated to Canada, and another 17,583 arrived in the following decade. In the late 1990s, South Korea became the fifth-largest source of immigrants to Canada. Toronto has the country's largest absolute number of Koreans, but Vancouver is experiencing {{the highest rate of}} growth in its Korean population, with a 69% increase since 1996. Montreal was the third most popular destination for Korean migrants during this period. In 2001, the number of Korean emigrants headed for Canada exceeded the number headed for the United States. The number of temporary residents has also grown ever since the Canadian government granted a visa waiver to South Korea; South Korea was the largest supplier of international students to Canada in the late 1990s. Aside from South Korea, some immigrants are also drawn from among the population of Koreans in China.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{raccoons}} entering urban life of human {{can go back}} to the beginning of the 20 th century (Lariviere, 2004; Bateman & Fleming, 2012). While some people see this animals as rewarding wilderness encounter, others may considers them as threatening safety concerns. (Clark, 1994) Indeed, the discussion around these highly adaptive creatures living in the cities has been going on for decades. A study in Texas, US shows that since 1980 s, raccoons have been recognized as the second largest cause of complaints regarding human-wildlife conflict, after rats and mice (Chamberlain et al., 1981). Raccoons are rabies-vector mammals, and also carry at least 13 other pathogens which are potential threats to human’s health (Lotze & Anderson, 1979; Wolch, 1995; Bateman & Fleming, 2012). Furthermore, there are evidences showing that driving by anthropogenic food sources and shelter, raccoons not only wander in the yards and raid garbage cans, but also settle down in houses as their den sites (Bateman & Fleming, 2012; Prange et al., 2003). They invaded through anywhere they could fit, such as roofs, chimneys, vents and even underneath the porches (Wolch et al., 1995; Clark, 1994). The facts that raccoons carry diseases around and cause destruction to the buildings brought urban residents to professional wildlife management organizations for help. On the other hand, the encounter of raccoons to urban people seems unavoidable. Raccoons living in the urban cities are considered to have better physical conditions and therefore higher survival rates, compared to their rural neighbours (Prange et al., 2003; Bateman & Fleming, 2012). Their major predators in the cities are cars, which is the number one cause of death according to Bateman and Fleming’s investigation (2012). Some scholars believe that raccoons tend to avoid roads and build-up areas (Bateman & Fleming, 2012), while other researchers, such as Ditchkoff and her colleagues (2006), suggested that raccoons forage on road-killed animals, which indicates their presence alongside the roads. Overall as natural creatures, raccoons have favor in parks and green spaces in the cities (Bateman & Fleming, 2012). It is worthy to notice that in many new suburban areas, larger areas with trees and other vegetation are preserved to separate the houses, which provides perfect wildlife habitats (travel, forage, cover etc.) for the animals (Ditchkoff et al., 2006). This paper investigates the spatial pattern of raccoons’ intrusion to dwellings in <b>Toronto,</b> Canada, in <b>terms</b> of which part of house they were found. Raccoons are highly adaptive mammals living in the urban settings, therefore it is possible to assume that the animals living nearby or having overlapped home range may learn from each other, which may be reflected by their den choices. A spatial illustration could help us learn more about raccoons’ behavior and adaptation to new environment, which is important to urban wildlife management practices...|$|R
