50|$|Sussex {{chickens}} {{are believed}} to have been first bred in Britain (in the area that was to become England) {{around the time of the}} Roman invasion of AD 43 making them one of the oldest known breeds. Originally bred as a table bird the Sussex has since become a dual-purpose bird, working for both meat and egg production. The original colours were the Brown, Red and Speckled, and the Silver is the latest variety. The breed was prized as <b>table</b> <b>fowl</b> more than one hundred years ago and, more recently, the Light Sussex was very popular for the laying trials of the 30s.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{celebrations}} {{surrounding the}} raising of the djed are described in a relief in Amenhotep III's Luxor Temple. In the tomb in the temple, the scene shows {{the raising of}} the djed pillar {{taking place in the}} morning of Amenhotep III's third Heb-Sed, which took place in his thirty-seventh regnal year. The scene is described by Sigrid Hodel-Hoenes: [...] The anthropomorphized pillar stands at the middle left, in a shrine. It has taken the shape of a human body with the djed-pillar as its head; the eyes are udjat-eyes. The hands hold the crook and flail, the usual insignia of Osiris, the god of the dead. On its head is the tall feather crown with the solar disk. The pillar is on a high base reminiscent of the platforms visible today in many temples, on which the cult barks once stood. In front of and behind it are lotus and papyrus blossoms. Beneath the large slab of the base are two tall offering stands - one bears a libation vessel, while flowers have been laid on the other. To the right is the king himself, presenting a generously laid <b>table.</b> <b>Fowl,</b> cucumbers, blossoms, breads, and heads and ribs of beef are all lying on the upper mat, while a cow and an antelope can be seen on the lower one. Beneath these mats are four tall vessels containing unguents and oil, with bundles of lettuce sticking out among them. The vulture goddess, Wadjyt, the Mistress of the Per-nu shrine, has spread her protective wings above the sovereign, with the blue crown on his head. Sigrid Hodel-Hoenes ...|$|E
40|$|THE STORY OF HOW FEATHERS EVOLVED IS FAR FROM OVER. IN 1868, THOMAS HUXLEY {{declared}} that dinosaurs {{gave rise to}} birds. He based his claim on Compsognathus, a 150 -million-year-old dinosaur fossil from Solnhofen, Germany, whose delicate hind legs were remarkably {{similar to those of}} <b>table</b> <b>fowl.</b> The discovery seven years earlier of Archaeopteryx, a fossil bird with a long bony tail, toothed jaws and clawed fingers, had convinced many people that birds were somehow related to reptiles. But Compsognathus was the fossil that placed dinosaurs firmly {{in the middle of this}} complex evolutionary equation. Wings, claimed Huxley, must have grown out of rudimentary forelimbs. And feathers? Whether Compsognathus had them, Huxley could only guess. Nevertheless, his theory clearly required that scales had somehow transformed into feathers. The question was not just how, but why...|$|E

40|$|Revised edition. "The breeds of {{chickens}} {{included in the}} Asiatic, English, and French classes are in the main of a relatively large size, and have been developed primarily as meat breeds. They are not so commonly kept in this country [the United States] as either the general-purpose or the egg breeds. The best-known meat breeds in the United States {{are those of the}} Asiatic class. However, the breeds of the English and French classes, while averaging somewhat smaller in size than those of the Asiatic class, were developed for their table qualities and therefore are popularly grouped among the meat breeds. In the opinion of many persons the Sussex and Orpington breeds, both English, are general-purpose breeds. The Orpington, in particular, is a fairly common and popular farm fowl in the United States. The best-known section of the United States in which large <b>table</b> <b>fowls</b> of superior quality are produced in considerable quantities is the South Shore distrct of Massachusetts, near Boston. The chicks are hatched in the fall or early winter, and both males and females are grown to a good size and marketed as South Shore roasters. The males usually are caponized, but are marketed as roasters rather than capons, and the pullets are marketed before they begin to lay. " [...] p. 2.

50|$|The {{first school}} in Badby was a charity school {{supported}} by the Knightleys of Fawsley and built in 1812 from a design by Wyatt in a Gothic and cruciform shape. Baker's states that the school was erected by the Lady Mary Knightley, daughter of Baines Esq. and niece of the Bishop of Worcester, who married Sir John Knightley in 1779.The Lady Knightley, whose name the school bore, provided everything {{for the education of}} twelve poor girls. The six younger girls were boarded and had clothing provided, including boots, shawls and bonnets. They were known as Sir Charles' Girls and were taught chiefly domestic work by a person from the village; this included the spinning and weaving of sheets. The six older girls were taught {{in much the same way}} and were known as Lady Knightley Girls. The older girls went to Fawsley each day to be taught by the housekeeper how to cook and clean, make beds, set <b>tables,</b> feed <b>fowl,</b> etc. They, too, were provided with all their clothes and at the age of twelve took a Labour Certificate examination. If they passed they could leave school, starting in situations with a good knowledge of household work. Otherwise, they stayed until they were fourteen. The school building was used in later years from 1870 as an infant school, {{supported by the}} Knightleys, until the County Council took over the education of the village children. It has now been listed as a building of historic interest.|$|R
