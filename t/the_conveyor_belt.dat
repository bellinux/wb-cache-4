5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. A conveyor belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. <b>The</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with a conveyor belt attached to <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
5|$|The left edge of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> is sharp due {{to higher}} density air moving {{in from the}} west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of {{stratiform}} precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt.</b> Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the conveyor-belt model for portraying the airflow through midlatitude cyclones, questions arise as to the path of <b>the</b> cold <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> <b>the</b> lower-tropospheric airflow poleward of and underneath the warm front. Some studies, beginning with Carlson’s analysis of the eastern U.

5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> originated in 1969.|$|E

After the food is placed on <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt,</b> it is sprayed with liquid nitrogen that boils on contact with the freezing food. This method of flash-freezing fresh foods is used to retain natural quality of the food.

500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] of the structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet of glass between the camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create lens flare. Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating the spiral structure of the Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead of the vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced the practicality of overhead wire control, the scenes of Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting {{the base of the}} helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence of the World President and Captain Brown standing on a moving walkway while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with the speed of <b>the</b> <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> powering the set below.
