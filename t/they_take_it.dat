5|$|Elsewhere, Nesbitt is {{spying on}} a swingers' party, and follows two women {{as they leave}} to buy more alcohol for the party. He impersonates a police officer and pulls their car over. The next day the women are {{reported}} missing by their husbands, and their bodies are found posed in a park. Nesbitt is next seen working in his pharmacy, when another young couple come in to purchase medication in preparation for an exotic honeymoon. Nesbitt instead surreptitiously gives them an MDMA-like drug, suggesting <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> immediately.|$|E
5|$|Picard finds Bok {{waiting for}} him, who has another orb. Bok {{explains}} {{that it was}} his son in command of the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and he came here seeking his revenge. He places the orb down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The orb lights up once more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious {{at the sight of the}} orb, which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a gas chamber. Three men, dressed in black uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night standing in the middle of a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} TRAMs {{when it is}} {{possible}} for another player to win at least one trick is penalized either by having to play the remainder of the hand with their cards exposed, by forfeiting all remaining tricks (at the discretion of the player who would otherwise take the trick, to prevent intentional false TRAMing that would give the player an advantage), or by forfeiting their bid (the hand will be scored as if that player failed to make their bid regardless of the number of tricks <b>they</b> <b>take).</b> <b>It</b> is always acceptable for players to play the remainder of tricks normally, even if they are positive they will take all remaining tricks.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} of the canal continued to decline. Complaints were made about its state in 1874 and 1885, which resulted in surveys being undertaken, but little was done to remedy the situation. In 1893, the Thames and Severn company announced that the canal between Chalford and Inglesham would close two days later. Negotiations {{with a number of}} interested parties took place, and having given an assurance {{that it would not be}} converted into a railway to the Great Western Railway, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1895, which formed a Trust with powers to raise £15,000. The Trust included representatives from the Sharpness New Docks & Gloucester & Birmingham Company, the Stroudwater Canal, the Staffs & Worcs Canal, the Severn Commissioners, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire County Councils and Stroud and Cirencester District Councils. At the same time as the Trust refurbished the canal, the upper Thames was upgraded by the Thames Conservancy. Although the canal was re-opened in March 1899, lack of water on the summit level soon closed it again, after which Gloucestershire County Council suggested that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> over. They did so on 2 July 1901. In 1925 they began negotiations with interested parties which ultimately led to the abandonment of the canal from Chalford to Inglesham in 1927. The Stroudwater Navigation managed to keep the remaining section open until 1933, when it was abandoned, and their own canal closed in 1941.|$|E

25|$|When {{the game}} begins, Ghost is searching among the {{detritus}} of Old Russia until it finds and resurrects the player's Guardian, {{who had been}} killed in an ancient battle. Ghost then guides the Guardian to a jump ship and <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> to the Tower. There, they meet the Speaker, who briefs them about the Darkness. The Guardian is then tasked to probe the nearby Cosmodrome, where humanity used to launch its forays into outer space, fending off Fallen enemies and eventually the Hive, who were thought to have been confined to the Moon. The Guardian discovers that an old Russian Warmind called Rasputin, an AI built to defend Earth, is still alive and acting with unknown intent. The Guardian also tracks down codes to raise an ancient Array to connect it to long-lost colonies throughout the Solar System, and finds that Rasputin is controlling the Array. They then set off to the Moon in search of a lost Guardian who was looking for a way into the Hive fortress. After locating his corpse and dead Ghost, the player's Guardian's Ghost discovers that the Hive are raising an army and plan to invade Earth. The Guardian quickly sets about disrupting their efforts, including shutting down a ritual that the Hive were using to drain power from the Traveler, destroying a powerful weapon called the Sword of Crota, and severing their long-distance communications. Around this time, the Guardian is contacted by the Exo Stranger, a mysterious woman who summons them to Venus to face a new enemy, the Vex.|$|E

He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the medallion and tells them it was the key to Atlantis. After hearing the story of Atlantis, the only thing SpongeBob and Patrick want to see is the [...] "World's Oldest Bubble." [...] Squidward then proceeds to reconnect the two halves of the medallion, opening the [...] "path to Atlantis", which is a bus that runs on [...] "song fuel".

500|$|Besides Big Sugar, Douglas {{spoke about}} the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by {{diverting}} the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than [...] of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C), run by {{former members of the}} Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. [...] "What a liar I turned out to be!" [...] remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, [...] "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out on us by playing with cement".|$|E

George and Anna Maria enter the palace and its catacombs where {{they find a}} golden cherub; <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> back to the hotel. After a romantic night with Anna Maria, George wakes up without her, and Mevlut comes in armed with a gun. George is {{locked up in a}} cell, as he is {{suspected}} to be a terrorist. In his cell, George gets a visit from Father Nicolas and Sister Immaculata, who says that he should meet her on the roof. George escapes from the cell and meets with Immaculata, who appears to be Nicole [...] "Nico" [...] Collard (his companion in previous installments). They return to the hotel, where George finds out Anna Maria has an apartment in Rome. In Rome, in front of Anna Maria's apartment building, George meets Brother Mark. After George figures out how to enter the building, Mark is not willing to give him a package that has arrived for Anna Maria.

2500|$|The Quran {{describes}} Muhammad as [...] "ummi", {{which is}} traditionally interpreted as [...] "illiterate," [...] but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as Al-Tabari {{maintained that the}} term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken {{as a sign of}} the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt prefer the second meaning of [...] "ummi" [...] – <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.|$|E

Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, it all works. Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady." [...] Eric Eisenberg from CinemaBlend gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Pitt is given what can be called the meatier part, as Max's raw nerves are fully exposed throughout the film {{as he tries to}} learn the truth about his wife -- but Cotillard's part is the more subtle and challenging, perfectly engulfing Marianne with an enigmatic air that perpetually keeps the audience guessing.

Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal.

[...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant.

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Luke fon Fabre has {{ranged from}} negative to positive {{based on his}} appearances in Tales of the Abyss. Based on his first impression of the game, Jeff Haynes from IGN called Luke a [...] "spoiled and sheltered child" [...] and noted how he was the opposite of Tear. GameSpot's Ashton Raze noted that Luke [...] "is highly obnoxious, at least at first, {{and the way the}} other characters riff off his behavior is entertaining." [...] Casey Brienza from Anime News Network (ANN) saw Luke's interactions with Cheagle Mieu as a big appeal in the anime's second episode. [...] "Anyone who has ever briefly nurtured homicidal thoughts when confronted by yet another cute anime creature will rejoice at his comedic whack-a-mole treatment and die laughing at his instantaneous hatred of its high-pitched squeal". Carl Kimlinger also from ANN found the character irritating. Christian Nutt of GamesRadar noted that Luke will probably annoy most players saying [...] "though any guy who's made it through his teens will wince... this stuff cuts close to the bone." [...] He also annoys the game's other characters and [...] "when the first big plot twist hits, <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out on him - too much". Alex Fuller of RPGamer commented that: [...] "The exceedingly good handling of character development is easily Abyss' biggest storytelling strength. Luke's journey from selfish and sheltered brat into the final hero of the game is plotted superbly." [...] Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer commented that Luke, in particular, stands out within the RPG genre's heroes [...] "as his evolution from spoiled brat to worthy hero is enjoyably organic." ...|$|E
