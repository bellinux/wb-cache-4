40|$|Monolithic {{nuclear fuel}} is {{currently}} being developed for use in research reactors, and friction bonding (FB) is a technique being developed to help in this fuel’s fabrication. Since both FB and monolithic fuel are new concepts, {{research is needed to}} understand the impact of varying FB fabrication parameters on fuel plate characteristics. This thesis research provides insight into the FB process and its application to the monolithic fuel design by recognizing and understanding the microstructural effects of varying fabrication parameters (a) FB <b>tool</b> <b>load,</b> and (b) FB tool face alloy. These two fabrication parameters help drive material temperature during fabrication, and thus the material properties, bond strength, and possible formation of interface reaction layers. This study analyzed temperatures and <b>tool</b> <b>loads</b> measured during those FB processes and examined microstructural characteristics of materials and bonds in samples taken from the resulting fuel plates. This study shows that higher <b>tool</b> <b>load</b> increases aluminum plasticization and forging during FB, and that the tool face alloy helps determine the tool’s heat extraction efficacy. The study concludes that successful aluminum bonds can be attained in fuel plates using a wide range of FB <b>tool</b> <b>loads.</b> The range of <b>tool</b> <b>loads</b> yielding successful uranium-aluminum bonding was not established, but it was demonstrated that such bonding can be attained with FB <b>tool</b> <b>load</b> of 48, 900 N (11, 000 lbf) when using a FB tool faced with a tungsten alloy. This tool successfully performed FB, and with better results than tools faced with other materials. Results of this study correlate well with results reported for similar aluminum bonding techniques. This study’s results also provide support and validation for other nuclear fuel development studies and conclusions. Recommendations are offered for further research...|$|R

40|$|For the {{manufacture}} of milled parts, {{it is well known}} that the size of the cutter significantly affects the machining time. However, for small-batch manufacturing, the time spent on loading tools into the tool magazine and establishing z-length compensation values is just as important. If we can select a set of milling tools that will produce good machining time on more than one type of parts, then several unnecessary machine-tool reconfiguration operations can be eliminated. This paper describes a geometric algorithm for finding an optimal set of cutters for machining a set of 2 D parts. In selecting milling cutters we consider both the <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> time and the machining time and generate solutions that allow us to minimize the total machining time. Our problem formulation addresses the general problem of how to cover a target region to be milled with a cylindrical cutter without intersecting with the obstruction region; this definition allows us to handle both open and closed edges in the target region. Our algorithm improves upon previous work in the tool selection area in following ways: (1) in selecting cutters, it accounts for the <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> time, and (2) it can simultaneously consider multiple different parts and select the optimal set of cutters to minimize the total manufacturing time...|$|E

FPPs are vital in coping with bottlenecks and breakdowns, and decreasing the flow time. Modeling FPPs within a loading model, however, increases the problem complexity. In this study, we work on the integrated version of FMS part type selection and loading problems, and propose two models that consider operation allocation {{at different levels of}} detail for an FMS with FPP.

40|$|In the {{planning}} process of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), an FMS must not be designed to fulfill its intended functions only, but also to perform the intended functions successfully. The latter requires the design of reliability into the system. The decisions involving the number of tools and tool redundancies need to be carried and executed in real time. This research discusses FMS tooling reliability {{in the context of}} the machine loading and part assignment problem. As manufacturing systems become more and more complex, competition and cost grow even more rapidly. Flexible manufacturing systems became the means to narrow the gap between the various different pressures. FMS promises more efficient and effective ways of utilizing resources, information and assets, due to its capability to carry a variety of different tools so that it can perform different operations required in the production of a variety of low to mid size part types. Integer-programming models are developed. The formulations consider an objective function with a set of governing constraints. A reliability level is decided for the tooling system, the models then will return with optimum number of tools and tool copies for each tool type. The overall objective is cost minimization while achieving maximum desired tooling system for the FMS under consideration. Two distinct scenarios are studied, the first considers an FMS where tool sharing is not allowed which implies that each tool magazine will be required to carry the required tools and tool copies to achieve the reliability levels decided and to carry the required machining operations on the different parts assigned to it during each production period. The second scenario is where tool sharing is permitted; in this case if a tool is not available on a particular tool magazine it can be borrowed from another magazine or from the tool crib. Two Genetic algorithms are developed and used to solve the two cases, the solutions are compared to solutions obtained by LINGO optimization software and conclusions are derived. The research conducted in this thesis is aimed at developing cost minimization models for the part assignment and <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> in flexible manufacturing systems with reliability considerations. The thesis of this research states that tooling system reliability can be integrated in FMS planning decisions, and that such models will complement some of the apparent limitations in the existing models. The models aim at assessing decision-maker to decide a minimum tooling system reliability and to optimize overall processing and tooling cost of the part assignment and <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> of FMS. A solution methodology is also presented in this thesis. The solution takes into account part assignment and <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> along with tooling system reliability of FMS under consideration.

The aim is to achieve polishing controllability as the bonnet tool executes a precessive motion trajectory. Taking an aspheric optical surface, e. g. lens or mirror, as the workpiece, the precessive polishing tool trajectory is designed as if the moving parts were rigid bodies connected by ideal articulations. Then by establishing the Jacobian stiffness matrix of the bonnet tool machine, the static stiffness of the machine is derived taking into account <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> along its path. To minimize deformation, the control algorithm that achieves a maximum static stiffness strategy is superposed on the rigid body system tool trajectory model. This combined bonnet tool trajectory is produced by numerical simulation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} thixoforming {{incorporates}} {{a series of}} forming processes in the semi-solid state, which can be categorized between the conventional processes of forging and casting and combines the advantages of these processes. Thixoforming of steels in the semi-solid state, requires round, solid particles (globulites) in a liquid matrix which is deformed with low forming forces. In order to achieve laminar material flow and to produce segregation-free components, the material must fulfil diverse criteria. First, the melting interval should be as large as possible for an easy temperature regulation. Next, low solidus and liquidus temperatures are advantageous regarding <b>tool</b> <b>loading.</b> Additionally, thixoformable steels should show a melting behaviour that is finegrained and globular. Furthermore, these steels should possess low contents of intraglobular liquid phase fractions. This paper gives {{a survey of the}} current state of steel Thixoforming and deals with the development of adaptive heat treatment strategies. Regarding the structure formation and the development of suitable heat treatment strategies, the once semi-solid state yields new structures that can be applied in ways not previously possible with conventional hardening processes.

40|$|AbstractWithin this work, a {{state-of-the-art}} Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian {{finite element model}} of a milling operation using coated hard metal cutting inserts is presented. During milling, the cutting depth constantly decreases, thus, to obtain the correct cutting depth, the model considers movement of the tool in a vertical direction. The behavior of the 42 CrMo 4 workpiece material is described using a standard Johnson-Cook material model. A detailed tool model able to represent both an uncoated and coated tool is created. The tool model {{is based on an}} industrial hard coated fine-grained hard metal tool with 8 wt. % Co.

Tool management literature considers <b>tool</b> <b>loading</b> problem when tools change due to part mix. In practice, tools are changed more often due to tool wear. The studies on tool management issues consider machining conditions as constant values. In fact, {{it is possible}} to change the processing time and tool usage rate of a job by changing the machining conditions. However, the machining conditions, such as cutting speed and feed rate e ect the processing time and usage rate of the tool in opposite directions. Increasing the usage rates of jobs will lead to an increase in number of tool switches. Processing times and number of tool switches are two components of our ob jective function. This two-side e ect creates a tradeo between processing time and tool usage rate. Therefore machining conditions should be selected appropriately in order to minimize the total completion time.

40|$|Emphasis on soil {{conservation}} {{in recent times}} has been {{brought about by the}} degradation of soils due to intensive tillage operations. A relatively new tillage philosophy, coined “conservation tillage”, has opened up a new realm of tillage equipment design. The Rotary Tine Aerator (RTA) is new tillage tool that is starting to see commercial applications within the agriculture industry. Being a new tillage tool, very little information has been gathered about the RTA and especially the variables that affect <b>tool</b> <b>loading.</b> For the purpose of improving the design of the soil engaging components of the RTA, an experiment was carried out investigating the effect various settings have on <b>tool</b> <b>loading.</b> A factorial experiment was set up with three factors and two levels. The variables examined were depth, velocity of the tool carriage and tine, and the tine gang angle, with soil density and moisture content maintained constant. Draft and vertical forces on the frame were seen to increase with depth. Side loading on the bearing mounts was seen to be primarily affected by the angle of the tine gang, increasing as the gang angle increased. Tool shape was seen to affect the side loading of the bearing mounts causing the force to change directions when the tool was working and 20 cm depth and the tine gang was set a 0 º. Forward velocity was not seen to be a significant factor affecting forces on the frame. The loading in the X, Y and Z direction on the tine increased as depth increased from 10 cm to 20 cm. A decrease in force on the tine in the X, Y and Z direction was seen with increasing tine velocity. It is suggested that an overlap in soil failure zones could be the cause of this relationship. Opening the gang angle from 0 º to 10 º increased the force in the Z direction and decreased the force in the X direction. Tool shape was also seen to affect the direction of the load on the tine in the Z direction when the tine was tilling at a depth 20 cm with a tine gang of 0 º. From the information gathered in this experiment, statistical models were developed for the loading on the tine and frame. The all possible regressors approach was used to formulate the statistical models. As each regressor was added, the new equation’s fit was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R 2) and the sum of squared error (SSE). If there was a discrepancy as to whether an added regressor significantly contributed to the fit of the equation, a hypothesis test using the F-statistic was used to justify the regressors addition or removal. The models were then compared against the original data. The models developed for the tine loading showed sufficient accuracy. The models for side loading of the bearing mounts and draft loading of the tool frame contained only one significant regressor. The lowest coefficient of correlation was R= 0. 63 for the model of side loading of the bearing mount. The statistical model for the vertical loading correlated well with the test data with a coefficient of correlation of R= 0. 95...|$|E
