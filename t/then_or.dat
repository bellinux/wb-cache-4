5|$|At Lampsacus, John {{met with}} his brother, who rewarded his {{victories}} with the title of despotes, the second after the emperor himself in the Byzantine hierarchy, while his father-in-law Tornikes and his half-brother Constantine were raised to sebastokratores. <b>Then,</b> <b>or</b> sometime after, he was also given the islands of Rhodes and Lesbos as personal domains (pronoiai). In July 1261, Constantinople was recovered and the Byzantine Empire restored with Michael VIII as sole emperor. In the meantime, however, things had been going badly in Epirus, where Michael II had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions in Macedonia. In 1261, John was sent on campaign against the Epirotes. After long and hard fighting, {{in the summer of}} 1263/1264 he achieved a major victory, which forced Michael II to come to terms: the Epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty, and his son and heir, Nikephoros, was married to Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael VIII.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school <b>then</b> <b>or</b> thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1831, Bowie married nineteen-year-old Maria Ursula de Veramendi, the {{daughter}} of his business partner, who had become the vice governor of the province. Several days before the ceremony, he signed a dowry contract promising to pay his new bride 15,000pesos (approximately $15,000 <b>then,</b> <b>or</b> $ today) in cash or property within {{two years of the}} marriage. At the time, Bowie claimed to have a net worth of $223,000 ($ today), mostly in land of questionable title. Bowie also lied about his age, claiming to be 30 rather than 35. The couple built a house in San Antonio on land Veramendi had given them near the San José Mission. After a short time, however, they moved into the Veramendi Palace, living with Ursula's parents, who supplied them with spending money. The couple had two children, Marie Elve (b. March20, 1832) and James Veramendi (b. July18, 1833).|$|E

25|$|In 1946 Congress {{established}} the civilian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the development of nuclear weapons from the military, and to develop nuclear power. The AEC made use of many private companies in processing uranium and thorium and in other urgent tasks related to the development of bombs. Many of these companies had very lax safety measures and employees were sometimes exposed to radiation levels far above what was allowed <b>then</b> <b>or</b> now. In 1974, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) of the Army Corps of Engineers was set up to deal with contaminated sites left over from these operations.|$|E
25|$|Rumors of Jesse James' {{survival}} proliferated {{almost as}} soon as the newspapers announced his death. Some said that Robert Ford killed someone other than James, in an elaborate plot to allow him to escape justice. These tales have received little credence, <b>then</b> <b>or</b> since. None of James' biographers accepted them as plausible. The body buried in Kearney, Missouri as Jesse James was exhumed in 1995 and subjected to mitochondrial DNA typing. The report, prepared by Anne C. Stone, Ph.D., James E. Starrs, L.L.M., and Mark Stoneking, Ph.D., stated the mtDNA recovered from the remains was consistent with the mtDNA of one of James's relatives in the female line.|$|E

Alternatives were mentioned, including a preferred 24km route between Waharoa and Apata with a 9km tunnel (essentially what ended up being the Kaimai Deviation). The budget for such an option was expected to be at least NZ$10.5 million. It was felt that there was still sufficient capacity on the existing line, and that the idea should be reviewed when demand required it.|$|E
