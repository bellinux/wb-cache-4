40|$|Thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) {{reinforcement}} bars constitute an important {{turning point in}} the construction industry due to their capacity to envelope high strength, high ductility and low cost simultaneously. The properties of any material depend heavily on their chemical content. Steel in Uganda being mainly of the recycled origin has an abundance of residual elements. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish the effect of these elements on the quality of the locally made TMT recycled steel bars. Particular interest has been paid to features influencing hardenability since it is the underlying factor in the mechanical peculiarities of TMT bars. Micro-hardness plots, tensile tests and spectro-analysis have been done on thirty randomly selected samples from local steel manufactures in order to relate the mechanical properties of the bars to their <b>tramp</b> <b>element</b> content. Unequal axial distribution of properties, asymmetrical radial distribution of hardness, low and inconsistent ring to core hardness ratio have been sighted as direct results of the recycled origin of the bars. Ladle refinement and the use of sponge/HB iron have been recommended as viable solutions in view of the existing national ore resources...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this life}} cycle {{assessment}} is to investigate refining methods which {{makes it possible to}} utilise post-consumer aluminium scrap in production of aluminium products that have strict requirements to chemical purity. A further goal is to establish whether applying these methods are environmentally preferable compared to using primary aluminium to produce the same products. The investigation is based on a given scrap composition and given purity limits that must be achieved for the refined aluminium, related to six alloying elements. Based on the given requirements, a selection of refining processes which are able to refine the given scrap to meet the given limits are identified. Table A below gives the scrap composition and the desired range of removal to fit seven different alloy requirements. The scrap composition is given in weight%. Table A: Scrap composition and desired level of removal.

Electrolysis can in theory be used to eliminate any <b>tramp</b> <b>element</b> in the scrap, as it extracts the pure aluminium from the melt using an electric current. Unfortunately this is an expensive, energy consuming process which requires use of chemicals. Fractional crystallisation does not require any chemicals and generally has low energy use, but this is a slow method which currently is not continuous. The ability of fractional crystallisation to remove the various elements depends on their solubility in aluminium in solid and liquid state. Various studies show that this method is promising for removal of Si, Fe and Cu, mediocre for Mg and Zn and poor for Mn. Based on this, six different production scenarios for secondary scrap, to meet the set of alloy requirements, were developed. The life cycle impact assessment conducted for the different refining scenarios shows that energy use is very closely linked to the environmental burden associated with each of the production scenarios. From an environmental perspective low temperature, electrolysis and fractional crystallisation seem to be the best alternatives. Since the assessment is based on specific requirements set by the scrap composition and the given purity limits, an overall impression is that other possibilities to handle excess scrap should be investigated further. For example better sorting processes to separate tramp elements earlier in the production or development of alloys which are made with a motive for recycling. Such methods {{are likely to be more}} relevant when the use of aluminium has increased even further and more stable sources of scrap can be established. </p...|$|E

There are upper limits for the number of cars in the hall and in the train, also for the number of railroad tracks used for assembly. Our objective is to find a minimum cost scrap combination for each melting bath unit of steel that obeys the material and transportation constraints.

40|$|Cu {{is known}} as one of the harmful <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> in {{recycled}} Fe. In the present work, the effects of Cu on Fe grain boundary (GB) embrittlement have been investigated by first-principles tensile tests. Because the Fe-Cu bonds are rather isotropic and the effects due to their difference in atomic size are negligibly small, the GB atomic structure prior to straining is little changed by Cu segregation. However, the Fe-Fe bond around the Cu atom is weakened due to charge transfer from the Fe atom to the Cu atom, and premature bond breaking occurs at the weakened Fe-Fe bond, resulting in an enhancement of GB embrittlement by Cu segregation. The s and p electrons play a vital role in the charge transfer...|$|R

40|$|In niobium (Nb) microalloyed steels {{one of the}} {{strengthening}} mechanisms is precipitation of Nb(C, N). Precipitation in austenite has been studied and applied for many decades, but its precipitation in ferrite has been paid less attention. Some of the findings are somewhat contradictory. Due to environmental and resource saving consideration in recent years, more and more scrap has been recycled and re-used. Thus, <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> inevitably exist in steel such as Cu, Sn, Ni and so on. These elements may influence properties of steels at some extent although they are very little in content. The X 80 steel examined in this thesis contains up to 0. 09 %wt. Nb, as well as 0. 4 % Cu, both of which can potentially precipitate in ferrite. However, most {{research has shown that}} Cu levels below 0. 5 % in steel do not precipitate out under normal processing conditions. In the present work, this X 80 steel was processed by a variety of thermomechanical treatments. The as hot deformed mechanical properties were tested and microstructures were characterized by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM). At low aging temperatures, simulating the coiling stage in steel hot rolling, many fine Cu precipitates were observed in ferrite compared to a few relatively large Nb containing precipitates.

40|$|International audienceAutomotive {{shredder}} fluff is a by-product vacuumed during the shredding of end-of-life vehicles (ELV) hulks, and further refined in Post-Shredder lines of Treatment (PST). To date in Europe the mineral part exiting the PST is mostly landfilled without regards for its potentially valuable iron content. Yet, iron {{could be used}} a use {{as part of the}} ore in blast furnaces, provided several issues related to the chemical composition of fluff were solved. Besides increasing iron content, several <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> must be curbed below tight specifications to avoid iron spoiling, furnace wall corrosion, and changes in the hydrodynamic profiles during iron reduction. The present work aims at designing such a fluff sorting process, on the basis of two representative fluff fractions properly sampled on an industrial PST. The size distributions of these fractions and the repartitions of their chemical elements are used to rationalize and compare three different sorting processes which couple sieving, wet attrition, and dry or wet Low Intensity Magnetic Separation. The best process led to an optimized iron recovery of 78. 5 % corresponding to an elemental iron content of 51 %, close to the ore grade required in a blast furnace.

30|$|The {{failure of}} a TBC system can occur by three modes: (a) de-bonding, (b) de-cohesion, and (c) {{mechanical}} disruption. Failure by de-bonding occurs due to de-bonding along the interface between the bond coating and the thermally grown protective oxide (TGO), predominantly along the α-Al 2 O 3 layer which bonds to the zirconia. The coating failure by de-cohesion {{occurs as a result}} of de-cohesion of the ceramic layer (near the interface) with the TGO. Mechanical disruption (rumpling) of bond coatings usually leads to significant displacement of the bond coating of the TGO and TGO-ceramic interfaces causing failure of the TBC. <b>Tramp</b> <b>elements</b> such as S {{have been shown to be}} detrimental to TGO adherence, so that alloying practices have been developed that routinely achieve S levels as low as 1 ppm. Controlled additions of reactive elements such as Y and Hf also can be used to counter the effects of S; such additions have been also shown significantly to modify the growth mechanism of the TGO and reduce its rate of growth, which promises to extend TBC lifetimes (Pint et al. 1998). Overall, improvements in understanding of the mechanisms of TBC degradation are providing routes for further improvements in their durability (Wright and Gibbons 2007). There has been a significant interest in the development of thermally grown oxides (TGO) in a deposited overlay (Choi et al. 2010). The integrity of the coating will depend on the ability of the alloy to grow an oxide layer with an appropriate combination of properties. While this approach can reduce costs and weight, it has been suggested that the life of a TBC system can be improved when the bond coating is eliminated because the TGO formed on the substrate benefits from the strength of the underlying alloy and, thus, has a greater resistance to buckling during thermal cycling (Wright and Gibbons 2007; Walston 2004).|$|R
40|$|Aluminum {{recycling}} is imperative {{because of the}} steady increase in its consumption. Recycling creates a secondary supply stream, lowers production costs and significantly reduces energy use during the production cycle. One of the limiting factors to increased use of scrap in alloys is problematic <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> that accumulate in the scrap stream. Currently, alloy producers make use of blending models to assist in choosing from {{a large number of}} inputs (scrap sources, primary aluminum, and alloying elements) to manufacture a portfolio of alloys within specification. The goal is to present cost-effective strategies to increase scrap consumption under the applicable context of different operating environments in aluminum production. These blending tools also aim to foster a fundamental shift in decision-making behavior to factor in uncertainties into the scrap management process. Alloys are batched to specification to maximize alloy function which includes a complex set of desired properties. While AA specifications have been put in place to guide batch blending decisions, often maximum constraints result in conservative scrap utilization, thus minimizing the potential for environmental and economic savings. With the wide variety of aluminum alloys available, batching them with the right applications is of the utmost importance, which becomes easier with property based constraints. While the blending models batch the alloys according to the specifications, it is equally necessary to batch them based on their properties to ease the decision making in the scrap management. This trade-off was presented using a linear programming optimization model that tracked four main alloying elements – silicon, magnesium, iron and copper. The optimization model examined the problem of mixing arbitrary quantities of raw materials (scrap aluminum, pure allowing elements and pure aluminum) to produce a set of alloys that met the property based specifications. For this thesis work, a few selected properties - electrical resistivity, density, elastic modulus and the melting point of aluminum were used as constraints to drive increased scrap use without negatively affecting the performance of the alloys. Results show that increased scrap utilization is possible for a set of specific cases...|$|R
40|$|As {{consumption}} in the US grows, so does concern about sustainable materials usage. Increasing recycling is a key component within a broad arsenal of strategies for moving towards sustainable materials usage. There are many barriers to increasing recycling; one that is problematic is compositional uncertainty in the scrap stream. Repeated recycling compounds this problem through the accumulation of <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> in the material stream over time. Pertaining to the available operational and technological strategies that exist to mitigate accumulation, this thesis addresses the following questions: 1) How effective are these strategies at mitigating accumulation? 2) Under what conditions do upgrading technologies provide a cost efficient and environmentally effective improvement to the composition of recycled scrap streams? To answer these, a method was developed combining dynamic material flow analysis with optimal allocation of those materials into production portfolios using blending models. This methodology thus captured 1) the flow of EOL scraps, 2) how the economics of production are affected by changes in technology, and 3) a characterization of how recycling parameters influence accumulation in recycled streams. Using this methodology, optimal allocation {{was found to be}} an effective strategy for mitigating accumulation, for example, iron in the scrap stream was 69 % less when compared to the value projected by conventional statistical methods. Two upgrading technology cases were examined using the time-dependent methodology developed: shredding, sorting, and dismantling of aerospace scraps and fractional crystallization. (cont.) Case results indicate that the time-dependent value of these technologies relies on whether or not the scrap stream is compositionally or availability constrained. These values were compared to analysis that does not consider repeated recycling (time-independent). Results show that undervaluing will occur in a regime where scrap availability is constrained and there is significant compositional accumulation occurring, a regime that may very well represent the reality faced by aluminum secondary producers in the US. by Gabrielle G.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{involved in}} the high temperature-creep deformation and fracture of low alloy steels have been extensively reviewed. The fracture behaviour of two series of alloy steels, 2 ¼ Cr 1 Mo and ½ Cr ½ Mo ¼ V, has been investigated over a range of temperature extending from the ambient to that experienced under typical power plant operating conditions. The effect of prior heat treatment, stress state and presence of <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> on the accumulation of creep damage has also been studied. In a heavily tempered condition, the 2 ¼ Cr 1 Mo alloy steels exhibited a high ductility and similar rupture mode over a wide temperature range. The sliding of adjacent prior austenite and bainite plate boundaries contributed to the overall creep strain. The presence of wide precipitate free zones suppressed the nucleation of grain boundary cavities and the dominant mechanism of damage accumulation involved decohesion, after large plastic strains, at the interface of coarse M 23 C 6 particles and the matrix. Growth of such damage occurred by -a viscous process that was inhibited {{by the introduction of}} a hydrostatic compressive component of stress. Additions of Sn had no effect on creep life or ductility over the range explored. The simulated heat affected zone structure of the ½ Cr ½ Mo ¼ V alloy steel possessed extremely limited ductility at typical power plant operating temperatures. Failure occurred by the nucleation, growth and interlinkage of cavities at the prior austenite grain boundaries. A nucleation mechanism has been invoked, involving the interaction of matrix dislocations and grain boundary precipitates. Growth of cavities probably occurred by vacancy transport. Detailed quantitative fractography has yielded empirical laws governing the nucleation and growth of such cavities which show some similarities to those suggested for the phenomenon in single phase materials. It was demonstrated that remaining creep life was a function of the previous stress history of the material...|$|R
40|$|Modern process logging {{systems for}} {{electric}} arc furnaces {{have the capability}} of storing large quantities of data, {{both in terms of}} variables and number of heats. The objective of this research is to evaluate how this data can be used for improvement of operating practices and optimisation of energy and scrap utilisation. In previous research projects, a process visualisation and monitoring system was developed and installed on four meltshops in Scandinavia. The system consists of a real-time database, a historical database, operator screens and a report generation system. By showing relevant information to the operators during the melting operation and generating reports based on the performance of the different operating teams, reduction of energy consumption, increase of productivity and reduced production costs could be achieved. Further analysis of data from the historical database {{led to the development of}} process optimisation tools for post combustion, hot heel practice, slag foaming and charging of scrap baskets. With the use of these tools, energy consumption and power-on time could be decreased further. However, steel scrap is the most important raw-material in electric steelmaking, contributing between 60 % and 80 % of the total production costs. Today the degree of which the scrap mix can be optimised, and also the degree of which the melting operation can be controlled and automated, is limited by the knowledge of the properties of the scrap and other raw- materials in the charge mix. In this thesis, multivariate regression methods have been used to develop prediction models for final chemical analysis of the steel, total electric energy consumption and metallic yield. The predictions are based on composition of the raw-material mix, total consumption of injected materials (like oxygen, oil, coal, slagformers) and initial condition of the furnace (hot heel composition). A prediction model for total energy consumption for melting of the first scrap basket based on continuous measurements of electrical parameters and wall panel temperatures was also developed. The models have been used to estimate some scrap properties (chemical composition, specific electrical energy consumption, yield coefficients), evaluate the efficiency of post-combustion and to estimate the optimal time to charge the second scrap basket. The results show that it is possible to provide estimates of the levels of <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> (Cu, Sn, As, etc.) and alloy elements (Cr, Ni, Mo, etc.) in commonly used scrap grades based on evaluation of commonly logged process data. To ensure that the estimates remain consistent with scrap quality, it is suggested that they be updated on a regular basis. It is also discussed how the estimates of scrap properties can be used for improved process control and monitoring of scrap quality. Godkänd; 2005; 20070102 (haneit) </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{automobile}} {{shredder residues}} “ASR” represents a heterogeneous material generated during the shredding {{process of the}} end-of-life vehicles “ELV”. The ASR, while reactive enough to be classified as hazardous waste, could {{be considered as a}} source of energy and reducing agents, since it contains an appreciated combustible hydrocarbon matter, especially plastics. In this context, the present work provides an alternative approach for the thermal valorization of the ASR in iron and steel making operations. Plastics and ASR samples from an European automobile shredder company were collected and their thermal behaviors were studied at temperatures lower than and or equal to 900 °C. Appropriated mixtures of these samples with iron oxides were isothermally treated between 300 °C and 1050 °C for different reaction times. Initial samples as well as solid reaction products were subjected to different analysis methods. The direct reduction of hematite into metallic iron, at 1000 - 1050 °C, by plastics and ASR hydrocarbons was proved. The reduction steps, the possible reaction mechanisms and the behavior of several <b>tramp</b> and harmful <b>elements</b> were also discussed. Experimental results and thermodynamic predictions suggest that the thermal route can be a promised choice for the valorization of the wasted organic materials. Thermal processing overcome the difficulties and costly operations related to the ultimate removal of lead, zinc and copper compounds by physical means from these wastes.

40|$|The high {{temperature}} ductility of steel increases as the grain size is decreased. However, in microalloyed steels this interdependence of grain size and hot-ductility is generally less pronounced because of the overriding effect of precipitation of carbo-nitrides of alloying elements at grain boundaries. Nevertheless, many types of crack {{have been shown to}} be associated with coarse austenite grains, and the tendency to crack is reduced when the formation of coarse austenite grains is prevented by the use of suitable secondary cooling. To our knowledge, a systematic study, to isolate the contribution of grain size on hot-ductility has not been reported and hence, under these circumstances, it is important to define clearly the contributing role of grains size to hot-ductility and therefore it is necessary to separate the effect on hot ductility of microalloying precipitates from that of grain size. The materials used for study were Fe- 0. 05 %C, Fe- 0. 18 %C and Fe- 0. 45 %C alloys, prepared in an experimental facility. Carbon was the only alloying element deliberately added to the melt and <b>tramp</b> <b>elements</b> and impurities were kept to as low a value as experimentally possible. A GLEEBLE 3500 thermomechanical simulator was used to conduct hot-tensile tests and from these results the relationship between austenite grain size and hot-ductility could be determined. The hot-ductility tensile tests in this study were performed in the temperature range 1100 to 700 degrees celsius. Hot-tensile test specimens were either solution treated or melted in-situ (direct cast) and cooled to the test temperature in order to simulate the microstructural characteristics of commercially as-cast slab which contains coarse austenite grains at the base of oscillation marks. In order to obtain different grain sizes, the specimens were solution treated at temperatures between 1100 degrees celsius and 1350 degrees celsius for 10 minutes. The specimens were then rapidly cooled to the test temperature, in the range 1100 degrees celsius to 700 degrees celsius at a rate of 200 degrees celsius min (superscript � 1) and then pulled to fracture at a low strain rate of 7. 5 � 10 (superscript � 4) s(superscript � 1). Specimens that were cast in-situ (referred to as the �direct casting condition�) were cooled at rates of 100 degrees Celsius min (superscript � 1) and 200 degrees Celsius min- 1 respectively in order to study the effect of cooling rate on hot ductility. It was found that grain size increased almost linearly with increasing solution treatment temperature in all the Fe-C alloys and in case of specimens solution treated at 1350 degrees celsius an average austenite grain size of ~ 4 mm in diameter was obtained. Increasing the grain size resulted in ductility loss under all testing conditions. The existence of a ductility trough between Ar(subscript 3) and Ae(subscript 3) temperature was considered to be due to the formation of deformation induced ferrite as evidenced by a constant peak stress region between these two temperatures. However, convincing experimental evidence of the ductility trough extending beyond the Ae(subscript 3) temperature well into the austenite was found. The mechanism of this interesting, and important observation for low carbon alloy below 0. 3 %C has not been explored as yet and at present it has to be assumed that it is related to the occurrence of grain boundary sliding because in the high austenite temperature region the grain boundary sliding is favored in a coarse grained structure. For specimens cast in-situ, the largest grains were found in the Fe- 0. 18 %C alloy for both cooling rates. This important observation is attributed to the higher austenitizing temperature of a Fe- 0. 18 %C alloy compared to that of the other Fe-C alloys studied. Moreover, the formation of columnar austenite grains were observed in this alloy on cooling, whereas equi-axed grains were formed in the other two Fe-C alloys. By such columnarization, the surface cracking susceptibility of the peritectic grade steel will be accelerated. The hot-ductility of the Fe-C alloy of near-peritectic composition was the lowest of the alloys studied and the inferior ductility in this alloy is attributed to the coarse grain size and columnar shape of the grains. The Fe- 0. 45 %C alloy had the smallest grain size at any specimens cast in-situ but the hot-ductility was much lower than would have been expected in an alloy of such small grain size. This much reduced ductility may be due to increased grain boundary sliding. At a higher cooling rate of the in-situ melted specimens, smaller grains were produced in all the Fe-C alloys resulting in ductility improvement. This grain refinement obtained at higher cooling rates have important implications for near-net shape casting operations such as thin-slab casting or strip-casting where much higher cooling rates are realized than in the conventional casting process, if the factors related with precipitation are removed. An important insight derived at through this study was that enlarged grain contributed more to reduced ductility at {{high temperature}} than did cast structure, at least under the pertaining experimental conditions. This observation has important practical implications because it means that efforts in industry could be concentrated on reducing the chances of forming large austenite grains, such as at the roots of oscillation marks due to a decreased cooling rate, without undue regard to the effect of these measures on cast structure. This study has provided convincing new experimental evidence of the extremely detrimental effect of large austenite grains on hot-ductility in plain carbon steels. The very large columnar shaped grains that can form in alloys of near-peritectic composition is particularly disconcerting. However, the influence of AlN precipitation on austenite grain boundaries on hot-ductility was not studied and it is recommended that this important topic should be included in subsequent investigation. The experimental data on these Fe-C alloys, provided in this study, may now be used to benchmark and further analyse the much larger body of information on low-alloyed steels available in the literature...|$|R
