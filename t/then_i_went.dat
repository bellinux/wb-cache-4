I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

[...] He has also described this series as follows: [...] "t's taking something that originally was suppose to mean immediacy and I'm tediously drawing something that looks like a brushstroke...I want it to look as though it were painstaking."

Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true, saying [...] "That's Tyson Gay. He's a humble guy, but I know it's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn't do that." [...] After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals (by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire) earlier in the year, Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal.

In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she [...] "replicated Salten's language almost completely. I reread the novel a number of times and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written." [...] Doing so retained much of the novel's original lyrical feel, though the book's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the [...] "majesty and mystery" [...] found in the novel. The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches. In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf, with Frank Dolan as the reader.|$|E

While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
