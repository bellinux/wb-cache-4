5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. Ingres was a master draftsman and <b>the</b> <b>sketches,</b> if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. <b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E
5|$|During her London winter, Potter {{developed}} her work, and, by {{the middle}} of June 1904, Benjamin Bunny was almost finished. Many of <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> from her Fawe Park holiday were little altered in their migration to the book, and, upon completion of the work, Potter declared she was relieved to be finished with the rabbits.|$|E
5|$|The series used by Pierre Boulez in his Structures 1a {{is found}} in <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> for Threni, but it differs so {{fundamentally}} from the row Stravinsky actually used that its relevance to Threni is unclear.|$|E

5000|$|A February 2017 episode {{introduced}} White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer {{played by}} Melissa McCarthy. <b>The</b> <b>sketch</b> received favorable comments in media, and Spicer thought <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was [...] "funny". Trump {{was reported to}} have disliked <b>the</b> <b>sketch.</b>|$|R
30|$|For <b>the</b> {{section on}} <b>sketching,</b> {{students}} were asked about their level of agreement {{with a variety of}} statements on the utility of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction during <b>the</b> latter, non-sketching focused, portions of <b>the</b> course. <b>The</b> <b>sketching</b> survey data, which are collected immediately after <b>the</b> 6 -week <b>sketching</b> portion of <b>the</b> course, revealed that students in the two instructional setting conditions and in the two instructor experience level conditions had largely different perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction itself. But on these items about later utility of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction, minimal differences in student perceptions were seen. Overall, these results indicate that, for the most part, these differential experiences during <b>the</b> actual <b>sketching</b> instructions did not translate into differential perceptions of how <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction served students during the remainder of the course.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> even {{led to a}} fanzine and {{appreciation}} gatherings, where fans would dress up as the characters. In 2004, in a poll on its website, Channel 4 voted Acorn Antiques the seventh best comedy sketch of all time. In 2005, Acorn Antiques {{was turned into a}} West End musical (see below).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> {{recounted the}} adventures of Dave Hollins (voiced by Nick Wilton), a hapless space {{traveller}} who is marooned in space far from earth. His only steady companion is the computer Hab (voiced by Chris Barrie).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, {{possibly}} even earlier. The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In <b>the</b> <b>sketches,</b> passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketch</b> {{also showed}} <b>the</b> Doctor {{examining}} a scantily clad female mannequin, claiming {{he thought it}} was an Auton. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> <b>the</b> Doctor regenerated into Todd Carty.|$|R
5000|$|On April 22, 2009, {{he participated}} briefly on <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> [...] "El caso del eslabón perdido" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> comedy show Muchachada Nui.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> <b>the</b> {{actors were}} greeted with [...] "Thank God you're here!" [...] from another actor in <b>the</b> <b>sketch.</b> Outside of <b>the</b> principal actor, all actors in <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> had a script which they {{more or less}} followed, depending on <b>the</b> improvisations. <b>Sketches</b> had no set ending point — instead, they went on until the judge (Foley) stopped them with a buzzer. Also, in each episode one of the skits would feature David Alan Grier in a surprise cameo.|$|R
5|$|A new comedy duo called Supergirly {{were also}} {{introduced}} from January 2000 {{to fill the}} gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as someone else. <b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> would usually culminate with the guests storming off.|$|E
5|$|At first <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> {{were derived}} almost {{exclusively}} from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|The Commission of Fine Arts met, and, at the {{suggestion}} of sculptor-member Lorado Taft, decided to ask Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser (no relation) who would be most suitable to turn <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> into plaster models, from which the Mint could make coinage dies and hubs. James Fraser suggested Peace dollar designer Anthony de Francisci, but sculptor Chester Beach was engaged instead.|$|E
5000|$|Advice to the Loveworn—Hee Haw Honey Lisa Todd, {{reclining}} on {{a living}} room sofa, gives wacky love advice in a sultry manner and closes <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> by winking at the camera. In later seasons of <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> George Lindsay, who provided the voice-over introduction in earlier seasons, now appeared on screen wearing a leisure suit, introducing <b>the</b> <b>sketch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Will Ferrell's {{idea for}} <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> came from hearing [...] "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" [...] over the years: [...] "Every time I heard song, I would hear the faint cowbell in the {{background}} and wonder, 'What is that guy's life like?'" [...] He co-wrote <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> with friend and playwright Donnell Campbell. Ferrell first submitted it for the episode with Norm Macdonald as host, which aired on October 23, 1999. SNL creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels was unsure about the premise, though <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> played well among crew at the table read. According to Seth Meyers, who served as head writer several seasons later, <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was submitted over seven times before making the show. Ferrell re-wrote <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> when Christopher Walken was scheduled to host, to fit the actor's rhythm. <b>The</b> <b>sketch</b> was put {{near the end of the}} episode, where more offbeat/odd sketches are often aired.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{locations}} of <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> bits are b1 < b2 < &middot;&middot;&middot; < br, then <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> of <b>the</b> key xw-1&middot;&middot;&middot;x1x0 is the r-bit integer [...]|$|R
5|$|The final {{versions}} of the sonatas convey {{the impression of a}} single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828. The sonatas were labeled Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of the}} last folio of the third sonata the date September 26. As compared to <b>the</b> <b>sketches,</b> the final versions are written much more neatly and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|E
5|$|The sketch comedy {{television}} show Saturday Night Live aired several critically acclaimed sketches parodying then Alaskan Governor and vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin in the lead-up to the 2008 United States presidential election. <b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> featured former cast member Tina Fey, who returned {{as a guest}} star to portray Palin. Fey won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her impersonation of Palin.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian {{heraldry}} and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române ("Romanian Boyar Families"). Many of {{the comments}} added by him to his {{copy of the book}} are polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon displaying a donkey's head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects he created were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign he created for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.|$|E
50|$|Born in Kingston, Ontario, Thornton was a {{founding}} member of <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> comedy troupe <b>The</b> Sketchersons, he also later appeared in <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> comedy series Hotbox and Sunnyside.|$|R
5000|$|With only {{standard}} word operations, such {{as those}} of the C programming language, it is difficult to directly compute <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> of a key in constant time. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> bits can be packed into a range of size at most r4, using bitwise AND and multiplication. The bitwise AND operation serves to clear all non-sketch bits from the key, while the multiplication shifts <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> bits into a small range. Like the [...] "perfect" [...] <b>sketch,</b> <b>the</b> approximate <b>sketch</b> preserves <b>the</b> order of the keys.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketch</b> {{featured}} background organ music {{similar in}} style {{to that of}} classic radio soap operas, {{including the use of}} dramatic strings during a key portion of <b>the</b> <b>sketch.</b>|$|R
5|$|In January 2013, it was {{announced}} that a contest would determine the mascot of the games. Children under the age of 16 had until March 8, 2013 to submit their ideas. 4,000 ideas and drawings were submitted to the organizing committee during this time frame. In April 2013, a shortlist of six mascot designs (which were produced by professional graphic designers, with <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> by the children as models) were released, including a raccoon, beaver, moose, two pixie creature twins, porcupine and an owl. The final six were selected based on originality, how well they represent Canadian culture and the branding of the Games, and the appeal they had amongst adults and children. On April 22, 2013, the general public was allowed to vote for the mascot they felt was the best. Voting was open until May 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> {{he made in}} the Alhambra {{formed a}} major source for his work from that time on. He also studied the {{architecture}} of the Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This {{turned out to be the}} last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.|$|E
5000|$|On 6 August 2010, <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> [...] "Killing Kyle Sandilands" [...] caused {{controversy}} {{after it}} aired. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> including stabbing {{a picture and}} burning an effigy of Kyle Sandilands, were received with negative views. A Current Affair did a story on <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> commenting that it was far too graphic and potentially dangerous. Sandilands himself did {{not comment on the}} segment.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, a plethora of tablet devices {{has made it very}} easy for users to input {{information}} by sketching as if on paper. In addition, sketch recognition sys-tems help users convert these sketches into information that the computer understands. While lots of work has been done in developing better sketch recognizers, very little work has previously been done on how to edit <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> once it's been drawn, whether the error is the user's or <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> recognizer's. In response, we developed and stud-ied intuitive methods of interacting with a sketch recognition system to correct errors made by both the recognizer and the user. The editor allows users to click and lasso to select parts of <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> label <b>the</b> selected strokes, erase by scribbling over strokes, and even overwrite errors. Letting users provide feedback to <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> recognizer helps improve the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> as well as allows <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> recognizer's performance to improve over time...|$|R
50|$|In 1977 the Dutch public {{broadcasting}} system created a Dutch version starring Joop Doderer but <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> never achieved <b>the</b> fame <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> has in German speaking and Nordic countries.|$|R
5|$|The {{well-known}} {{character of}} Pauline Fowler {{has also been}} referenced in various television programmes, unrelated to the EastEnders universe. In 1997 she was mentioned in an episode of the successful BBC drama This Life. Two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watch an episode of EastEnders on television and mock Pauline's hysterics and her well-documented tendency to wear cardigans. The character was also regularly spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show, The Real McCoy (1991–1995). One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of EastEnders, with black comedians taking over roles of well known EastEnders characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian Llewella Gideon {{played the role of}} Pauline. <b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> placed considerable emphasis on the character's high-pitched voice and her tendency to whine. The character's fashion sense has also been referred to in BBC Two sitcom Beautiful People (2008).|$|E
5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto painting to Leech, who consulted with Barber and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that Barber could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia. Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was negative, and the newspapers suggested that <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used.|$|E
5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series Sledge Hammer! (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with {{such topics as}} capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E
2500|$|... "Harry Bladder" [...] was a <b>sketch</b> on <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> comedy show All That. Instead {{of flying}} on a broom, Harry rode a leaf-blower. <b>The</b> <b>sketch</b> also {{featured}} a bowlegged Professor Chafe.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketch</b> of <b>the</b> second Aequale was {{retrieved}} {{later in}} the archive of the St. Florian Abbey. In <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> <b>the</b> score for the bass trombone is missing. It was then put as addendum (WAB 149) to the already issued WAB classification.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Jockey <b>Sketch</b> - {{in which}} Mack plays a winning Irish jockey who speaks {{too fast for}} Ancona (a reporter) to understand.
