5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Painted</b> Desert Visitor Center, {{designed}} by modernist architect Richard Neutra, {{is part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Painted</b> Desert Community Complex Historic District {{and is on the}} National Register of Historic Places. Eight other sites within the park are also on the National Register, including <b>the</b> <b>Painted</b> Desert Inn and associated cabins, the Agate House Pueblo, <b>the</b> <b>Painted</b> Desert Petroglyphs and Ruins Archeological District, Newspaper Rock Petroglyphs Archeological District, Puerco Ruins and Petroglyphs, the Flattops Site (an archeological site), the Twin Buttes Archeological District, and the 35th Parallel Route (also known as the Beale Camel Trail). <b>The</b> <b>Painted</b> Desert Inn was upgraded to a National Historic Landmark in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In children's books, <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle is {{a popular}} subject, with at least seven books {{published}} between 2000 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. <b>The</b> <b>painted</b> turtle is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
50|$|Important {{painters}} given a sobriquet {{based on}} a name vase include for example <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Berlin A 34, <b>the</b> Nessos <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Andokides <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Antimenes <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Antiphon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Bryn Mawr <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Pistoxenos <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> began <b>the</b> same day. Following consultations with chemists, art restorers began washing {{the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> with water; they kept <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in <b>the</b> vertical position, and sprayed water at <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to prevent further degradation of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter</b> became <b>the</b> Achilles Painter's most {{prominent}} student after he assumed the Berlin Painter's workshop. Almost {{a dozen other}} recognizable painters passed through the Achilles Painter's workshop as well. Notable painters include <b>the</b> Westreenen <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Persephone <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Clio <b>Painter,</b> Loeb <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sabouroff <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Munich 2335 all spent time at the workshop as well.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>painted</b> turtle (C.picta) is {{the only}} species in the genus Chrysemys. The parent family for Chrysemys is Emydidae: the pond turtles. Emydidae is split into two sub families; Chrysemys {{is part of the}} Deirochelyinae (Western Hemisphere) branch. The four {{subspecies}} of <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle are the eastern (C.p.picta), midland (C.p.marginata), southern (C.p.dorsalis), and western (C.p.bellii).|$|E
5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1783 by Johann Gottlob Schneider as Testudo picta, <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle was called Chrysemys picta first by John Edward Gray in 1855. The four subspecies were then recognized: the eastern by Schneider in 1783, the western by Gray in 1831, and the midland and southern by Louis Agassiz in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Pet {{releases}} {{are starting}} to establish <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle outside its native range. It has been introduced into waterways near Phoenix, Arizona, and to Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Spain.|$|E
50|$|Philippe Maestracci claims {{ownership}} of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> through inheritance through his grandfather. According to Maestracci, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{was taken from}} his grandfather, Jewish Parisian art dealer Oscar Stettiner, by the Nazis during the German occupation of France. In 1939, Oscar Stettiner left <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> behind in France ahead of the German occupation. The Nazis took administration over <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1941 and auctioned off <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1944. In 1946, Oscar Stettiner filed a claim to recover <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> but <b>the</b> French authorities were ultimately unable to track down <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was {{purchased}} from Turner by William Beckford in April 1800. Henry Jeffrey purchased <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1807, before {{selling it to}} Thomas Tutor. George Young acquired <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> by 1853, {{and it was at}} sale at Christies in London in 1866. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> {{was purchased}} by Earl Grosvenor in 1866 and stayed in his possession until at least 1871. In 1876, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was bought by Sir Francis Cook, where <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> stayed until 1951. It was sold to Sir Alexander Corda by the Cook family. John Mitchell bought <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in 1955; <b>the</b> IMA purchased <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in <b>the</b> same year from Mitchell with funds from the Lilly family.|$|R
5000|$|The Varrese Painter's {{workshop}} also {{employed the}} Wolfenbüttel Painter; his influence {{has been noted}} {{not only on the}} predecessors of <b>the</b> Darius <b>Painter,</b> but also on <b>the</b> Ginosa <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Bari 12061, <b>the</b> Metope <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Louvre MNB 1148 and <b>the</b> Chamay <b>Painter.</b>|$|R

Bloody Crumpets members The Blessed Contessa and Captain Maggot also appear in the film as Woe-Maidens.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family. It is known {{by a variety of}} common names, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> slipperycap, <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> suillus or the red and yellow suillus. Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomical history, and is also frequently referred to Suillus pictus in the literature. The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The stalk bears a grayish cottony ring, and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>painted</b> {{surface is}} divided into {{quarters}} horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time. Velázquez presents nine figures—eleven if the king and queen's reflected images are included—yet they occupy only {{the lower half of}} the canvas.|$|E
50|$|Several vase {{painters}} had specialised in <b>painting</b> Siana cups. <b>The</b> {{most important}} {{among them was}} <b>the</b> C <b>Painter.</b> Others include <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Athens 553, <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Boston CA, <b>the</b> Kassandra <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sandal <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Civico <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Griffin-Bird <b>Painter.</b> At present, about 1,000 cups and fragments are known; a classification vital for their chronology and stylistic categorisation has been developed by Herman Brijder. A special type are so called Merrythought Cups, with a forked handle.|$|R
50|$|When Lincoln had <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{exhibited}} to <b>the</b> {{public in}} the East Room of the White House, Carpenter noted that the exhibition was thronged with visitors. An engraving of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was made by Alexander Hay Ritchie for mass reproduction. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was well received by critics, according to newspaper advertisements for those reproductions; also, many of the subjects in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> commented favorably. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> itself then toured the country.|$|R
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was {{displayed}} {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After <b>the</b> war <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> has been {{in the collection of the}} Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to be shown. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was restored in 2007.|$|R
5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species {{to create this}} bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper argued that the bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring and early summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at <b>the</b> <b>Painted</b> Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
5|$|A cold-blooded reptile, <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle regulates its {{temperature}} {{through its}} environment, notably by basking. All ages bask for warmth, often alongside {{other species of}} turtle. Sometimes more than 50individuals are seen on one log together. Turtles bask {{on a variety of}} objects, often logs, but have even been seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> {{comprises}} {{a collection}} of pieces of paper, folded and sewed together, painted with colorful, abstract watercolor paintings. Carter's signature {{is located on the}} bottom right of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> reading: Yvonne Pickering Carter '78. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is attached to a piece of plexiglas. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is part of Carter's Diminutive Folded Linear Series.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was {{engraved}} and {{was very}} popular. Tickets were sold to {{people who wanted to}} see <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> when it was exhibited in 1841. An 1846 engraving by William Greatbach of <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> also sold well. It was proposed in 1852 to purchase <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> from <b>the</b> artist by public subscription, however this failed to achieve its goal probably due to the Duke's death in September 1852. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> remained unsold and passed down to Salter's heirs.|$|R
2500|$|Important {{painters}} of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include <b>the</b> Providence <b>Painter,</b> Hermonax, and <b>the</b> Achilles <b>Painter,</b> all following <b>the</b> tradition of <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter,</b> probably a pupil of <b>the</b> Achilles <b>Painter,</b> is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable {{examples include the}} so-called [...] "mannerists", most famously among them <b>the</b> Pan <b>Painter.</b> Another tradition was begun by <b>the</b> Niobid <b>Painter</b> and continued by Polygnotos, <b>the</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dinos <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of <b>the</b> Penthesilea <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{group of}} friends browse the {{internet}} for pornography, finding a live stream of a woman bound to a chair. Behind her a number is painted on the wall; when the feed's web counter reaches <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> number, a masked man appears and cuts the girl's throat. The boys quickly print {{an image of the}} feed as proof of what they have seen, just before the website disappears.|$|E
5|$|A reptile {{becomes the}} {{official}} state symbol {{after it is}} voted in by the state legislature. Although many states require the bill to be signed by the governor, in some the enabling act is a resolution (legislature vote only). In 2004, Illinois held a popular vote to pick <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle, but legislation was still required in 2005 to make the choice official.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{evolutionary}} history—what the forerunner to {{the species}} {{was and how}} the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15million years ago. Fossils from 15million to about 5million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.|$|E
50|$|Woman VI is a life-sized painting. A woman figure {{stands in}} the center of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>the</b> {{proportion}} of the figure on <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> is two thirds.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was {{probably}} commissioned by {{an important and}} wealthy patron; Gentileschi <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> blue sheets on <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> using two layers of lapis lazuli, an expensive material for artists to obtain.

5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} <b>the</b> <b>painted</b> turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On <b>the</b> <b>Painted</b> Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the denser foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>The</b> <b>Painted</b> Hills in 1951, MGM {{executives}} felt Lassie had run her {{course and}} planned no future films featuring the character. MGM executives then sought {{a way to}} break Weatherwax's contract. Weatherwax was concerned about protecting Pal and the Lassie image he had created from future diminishment {{at the hands of}} others. In lieu of US$40,000 in back pay owed him by the studio, Weatherwax bargained for and received the Lassie name and trademark.|$|E
50|$|As Kinnell travels north, {{he stops}} at his aunt's house to show her <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and notices {{that some of the}} details in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> have changed. At first, he dismisses this by {{assuming}} he hadn't examined it closely, but he soon realizes that <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> is continuing to change. Deeply unsettled by this fact, he discards <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> at a rest stop.|$|R
50|$|The 1997 Rowan Atkinson film Bean {{features}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> as a plot element. An American {{is buying}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{in order to}} {{return it to the}} United States. But Bean ruins <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> by using lacquer thinner after sneezing on it and then drawing a cartoon face on it. He surreptitiously replaces <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> with a poster from the museum shop.|$|R
