25|$|Most jurisdictions require {{self-assessment}} {{of the tax}} {{and require}} payers of some types of income to withhold tax from those payments.

25|$|Montana's {{personal}} income tax contains 7 brackets, with rates ranging from 1 percent to 6.9 percent. Montana has no sales tax. In Montana, household goods are exempt from property taxes. However, property taxes are assessed on livestock, farm machinery, heavy equipment, automobiles, trucks, and business equipment. The amount of property <b>tax</b> <b>owed</b> is not determined solely by the property's value. The property's value is multiplied by a tax rate, set by the Montana Legislature, to determine its taxable value. The taxable value is then multiplied by the mill levy established by various taxing jurisdictions—city and county government, school districts and others.|$|E

5000|$|The {{income tax}} is taken [...] "off the top", so the {{individual}} is left with $80 in after-tax money. Some tax laws impose taxes on a tax base equal to the pre-tax portion of a good's price. Unlike the income tax example above, these taxes do not include actual <b>taxes</b> <b>owed</b> {{as part of the}} base. A good priced at $80 with a 25% exclusive sales tax rate yields $20 in <b>taxes</b> <b>owed.</b> Since the sales tax is added [...] "on the top", the individual pays $20 of tax on $80 of pre-tax goods for a total cost of $100. In either case, the tax base of $100 can be treated as two parts—$80 of after-tax spending money and $20 of <b>taxes</b> <b>owed.</b> A 25% exclusive tax rate approximates a 20% inclusive tax rate after adjustment. By including <b>taxes</b> <b>owed</b> in the <b>tax</b> base, an exclusive tax rate can be directly compared to an inclusive tax rate.|$|R

25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all <b>tax</b> <b>owed</b> on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E

50|$|For direct rate {{comparisons}} between exclusive and inclusive taxes, one rate must be manipulated {{to look like}} the other. When a tax system imposes taxes primarily on income, the tax base is a household's pre-tax income. The appropriate income tax rate is applied to the tax base to calculate <b>taxes</b> <b>owed.</b> Under this formula, taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed. If an individual's gross income is $100 and income tax rate is 20%, <b>taxes</b> <b>owed</b> equals $20.|$|R
2500|$|A {{refundable}} {{tax credit}} is a mechanism whereby {{the tax system}} can reduce the <b>tax</b> <b>owed</b> by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include {{the earned income tax}} credit and the additional child tax credit in the US, and working tax credits and child tax credits in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax, in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income. [...] This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).|$|E
2500|$|According to an {{analysis}} published by FactCheck in May 2009, radio advertisements run by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers, and the National Education Association told only [...] "half the story".

The <b>tax</b> <b>owed</b> on that increase in wages is accompanied by a new tax deduction for everyone earning less than $125,000 a year ($250,000 for couples). The new deduction starts at $6,025 per individual, and decreases in stages until the $125,000/$250,000 income caps are met.

Refundable tax credits differ from other preferences in a significant way: Whereas other preferences reduce the amount of <b>taxes</b> <b>owed</b> to the government, refundable credits can result in net payments from the government. Specifically, if the amount of a refundable tax credit exceeds a filer’s tax liability before that credit is applied, the government pays the excess to that person or business.

2500|$|Tax Credits: Tax credits {{can remove}} {{a portion of}} the income <b>tax</b> <b>owed</b> to the state by the {{production}} company, but since most production companies are limited purpose business entities they often incur very little, if any tax liability. [...] The use of the word [...] "tax credit" [...] or [...] "tax rebate" [...] often results in public confusion, as they layperson may think the program is a refund of taxes paid by the production, when it is actually based on a significant percentage of the production's actual spend and the amount is awarded regardless of whether the entity pays taxes (which they generally do not) (as explained by Louisiana's Chief Legislative Economist: “It’s {{got nothing to do with}} tax...We’re just using the tax-filing process and the Department of Revenue as the paying agent for a spending program. That’s what we’re doing.”) [...] Production companies must often meet minimum spending requirements to be eligible for the credit. [...] Of the 28 states that offer tax credits, 26 make them either transferable or refundable. [...] Transferable credits allow production companies that generate tax credits greater than their tax liability to sell those credits to other taxpayers, who then use them to reduce or eliminate their own tax liability. Refundable credits are such that the state will pay the production company the balance in excess of the company's owed state tax.|$|E
