5|$|V. Harikrishna {{scored the}} film's {{background}} music and composed its soundtrack, lyrics for which was penned by Jayant Kaikini, Yogaraj Bhat and Hrudaya Shiva. The soundtrack album consists of six tracks. It {{was released in}} Bangalore on 16 December 2007 {{in the form of}} audio cassettes and compact discs, both of which were then distributed <b>to</b> <b>buyers</b> attached to a kite, symbolic to the title of the film. Invitees included film producers and directors V. Ravichandran, Duniya Soori, Rockline Venkatesh and E. Krishnappa. Ashwini Music of Ashwini Media distributed the audio into the market.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value <b>to</b> <b>buyers</b> to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk <b>to</b> <b>buyers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Over ten {{thousand}} stores across forty countries opened for the midnight launch of Halo 4. On {{the evening before}} {{the release of the}} game, a fifty-foot diameter illuminated Didact glyph was flown by a helicopter over the River Thames in London, from the Greenwich Peninsula to Tower Bridge. The glyph was created by a team of over fifty designers, engineers and fabricators and took approximately eight weeks to design and construct. Following the release of the game, New Zealand censors declared many copies of Halo 4 illegal, after deciding to label it with an R13 rating, restricting it <b>to</b> <b>buyers</b> aged 13 and over. Many copies of the game had already gone on sale with an unrestricted M certificate, but these copies are in breach of the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Lexus LS {{marked the}} first {{successful}} entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena, a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands. By 1991, with the LS 400 its top-selling model, Lexus had overtaken Mercedes-Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales, and in 2000, the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market. Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features. In particular, Mercedes-Benz reorganized its operations, shifting to a targeted-cost process similar to Lexus production methods, and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent. To rival the LS 400, extra features were rushed for {{the launch of the}} 1991 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W140), causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler-Benz's chief engineer, Wolfgang Peter. Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went <b>to</b> <b>buyers</b> employed by rival manufacturers, including GM, Ford, and Chrysler. When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis, Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods. Industry publications noted the LS 400's precise panel gaps, and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests. The LS 430's interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{cultural}} {{interest in}} British castles persisted in the 20th century. In some cases this had destructive consequences as wealthy collectors bought and removed architectural features and other historical artefacts from castles {{for their own}} collections, a practice that produced significant official concern. Some of the more significant cases included St Donat's Castle, bought by William Randolph Hearst in 1925 and then decorated with numerous medieval buildings removed from their original sites around Britain, and the case of Hornby, where {{many parts of the}} castle were sold off and sent <b>to</b> <b>buyers</b> in the United States. Partially {{as a result of these}} events, increasing legal powers were introduced to protect castles – acts of parliament in 1900 and 1910 widened the terms of the earlier legislation on national monuments to allow the inclusion of castles. An act of Parliament in 1913 introduced preservation orders for the first time and these powers were extended in 1931. Similarly, after the end of the Irish Civil War, the new Irish state took early action to extend and strengthen the previous British legislation to protect Irish national monuments.|$|E

25|$|The strong {{participation}} by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved {{on a shoestring}} budget with the automaker racking up a respectable number of points against its giant competitors.

At the time, the Oakland Raiders were threatening to move to Los Angeles, and city and county officials were not willing to lose Oakland's status as a big-league city in its own right. Not surprisingly, only 306,763 paying customers showed up to watch the A's in 1979, the team's worst attendance since leaving Philadelphia.|$|E
