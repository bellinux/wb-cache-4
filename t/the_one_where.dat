The broadcaster also commissioned a behind-the-scenes program from Princess Productions. Hosted by British television personality Johnny Vaughan, <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>Where</b> Johnny Makes Friends features comedic tongue-in-cheek interviews with all six main cast (Vaughan contacted Kudrow by payphone, claiming that he couldn't make international calls from his dressing room) and was broadcast on Channel 4 on May 6, 1998.|$|E
5|$|The University Belt {{refers to}} the area {{where there is a}} high {{concentration}} or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the San Miguel, Quiapo and Sampaloc districts meet. Generally, it includes the western end of España Boulevard, Nicanor Reyes St. (formerly Morayta St.), the eastern end of Claro M. Recto Avenue (formerly Azcarraga), Legarda Avenue, Mendiola Street, and the different side streets. Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other. Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the Pasig River, mostly at the Intramuros and Ermita districts, and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part of Malate near the border with Pasay such as the private co-educational institution of De La Salle University, the largest of all De La Salle University System of schools.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{photographs}} of Bahá'u'lláh, both {{taken at the}} same occasion in 1868 {{while he was in}} Adrianople (present-day Edirne). <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> he looks at the camera was taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bahá'í Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bahá'í World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes, and Bahá'í institution strongly suggests to use an image of Bahá'u'lláh's burial shrine instead.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, {{the tension in the}} tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement of the tension in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E

25|$|Normally, a {{condition}} of the application process is that the appointed interim councillor does not run as a candidate in the next regular election, so {{that he or she}} does not gain an unfair incumbency advantage.

25|$|Saint Rumwold is {{reported}} to have been born in Walton Grounds, near King's Sutton in Northamptonshire, which was at that time part of the Mercian royal estates, possessing a court house and other instruments of government. The field in which he was born, where a chapel once stood on the supposed spot, may still be seen. King's Sutton parish church claims that its Saxon or Norman font may well have been <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> Saint Rumwold was baptised. There are two wells associated with his name: in Astrop, just outside Kings' Sutton, and at Brackley and Buckingham, where his relics once lay. Church dedications largely follow the missionary activity of Saint Wilfrid, who was the personal chaplain of King Alhfrith (source: Bede), but once spread as far as North Yorkshire, Lincoln, Essex and Dorset.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, the contingents {{increased to}} 76, {{including those of}} the then established Singapore Armed Forces, the RSP and more cultural groups, with the addition of more civil marching groups. The reason is partly due to the introduction of the National Service program in the military and police forces, and later extended to the Fire Brigade, later called the Singapore Fire Services in the 1970s. Street performances by various groups also debuted in that year's parade. The 1968 edition, although held on a rainy morning that surprised even the marching contingents and the dignitaries, saw the first ground performances on the Padang as the weather improved - a prelude to today's show performances. 1969's parade, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the Mobile Column made its first drivepast, commemorated the 150th year of the city's founding and had Princess Alexandra of the UK as principal guest.|$|E
25|$|Our Lady of Mantara in Maghdouché, Lebanon, {{also known}} in English as Our Lady of Awaiting, is a holy Christian site and a Marian shrine. The shrine {{consists}} of a tower crowned with the statue of the Virgin and Child, a cathedral, a cemetery and a sacred cave believed to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> the Virgin Mary rested while she waited for Jesus. Ever since the rediscovery, the cave of Our Lady of Mantara has been open to the public. It {{has become a major}} pilgrimage site in the Lebanon. The adjacent hilltop where Jesus and Mary had once stood is now Sidon's Greek Catholic cemetery. Grand festivities are held each year on September 8 to commemorate the rediscovery of the sacred cave. Near the sacred cave, the people of Magdhdouché built a cathedral and a modern tower crowned with a bronze statue of the Virgin and Child. The tower offers pilgrims panoramic views of Sidon, the Mediterranean, and the lush hills, valleys and citrus groves of South Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{reveal that}} France seems to be, among the Western countries, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>where</b> Muslims {{integrate}} {{the best and}} feel the most for their country.

The study from the Pew Research Center on Integration {{is an example of}} works revealing this typically French phenomenon. In Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region where French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, the vast majority rejects violence and say they are loyal to France according to studies by Euro-Islam, a comparative research network on Islam and Muslims in the West sponsored by GSRL Paris/CNRS France and Harvard University. On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily Le Monde indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A thorough survey by the Pew Research Center in Spring 2014 revealed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a favourable opinion.|$|E
