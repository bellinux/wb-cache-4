30|$|How to {{calculate}} effectively the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> to set wage growth nationally in each year {{gives rise to}} some questions. In a country not experiencing technological change, productivity growth will be more static until reaching the technological frontier. Thus, reversion to its mean as a new wage policy is favorable. The future prediction of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> is relatively difficult. As seen in the stock market, the change of any variables inclines toward its mean after straying above or below the mean {{in the long run}} in a free market economy. Figure  1 shows the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> and its mean by considering its historical fluctuation between 1973 and 2011. The historical mean of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> is 3.7 %, calculated by taking into account approximately 38  years of the Turkish economy. Moreover, until the economy reaches the technological frontier, the configuration of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> is unlikely to show any great long-term shift from its mean. In Fig.  1, although the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> strayed away from its historical average, in the long run, it moved closer to it and continued fluctuating around its mean. Therefore, it is desirable to consider the historical mean value of productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> for wage growth and estimate the flexibility of wage growth, where the two essentials should at least come to balance in the long run to reduce macroeconomic instability. To do this, wage growth, remaining above the mean, must increase at the same pace as the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> and reach its mean. Nevertheless, wage growth in the Turkish economy does not show a reversion to its mean and does not move around the mean. That shows that wage growth is not flexible and is generally influenced by economic policies in the country, running counter to the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods,</b> which has not been easy to control by government interventions or industrial actions. This new wage policy is important and must be considered by the trade unions, employers’ associations and the government.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{macroeconomic}} imbalances in the economy, Turkey needs to change its current institutional forms. First, Turkey must implement the mathematical base social contract. According {{to this type of}} contract, in {{order to reduce}} the individual interests of trade unions, employers’ associations and the government, wage growth must be indexed to the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods.</b> Second, Turkey needs to implement a new wage-setting policy, taking into consideration the reversion of the mean of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods.</b> That means that wage policy in the country must be more flexible and be determined according to economic conditions. As the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> cannot be set by a control, but rather by market conditions, wage growth must be implemented by considering the reversion of the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> to its mean. Finally, a new inflation policy must be implemented for the sake of wage-bargaining policy. In other words, instead of considering the inflation rate for wage bargaining, the productivity growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> must be taken into account. Hence, Turkey will be able to reduce inflation and unit labor cost growth and experience more favorable macroeconomic factors.|$|R

30|$|The {{exchange}} rate system was a fixed system. However, the lira experienced significant devaluations {{caused by the}} high ULC growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> because it increased dramatically while productivity growth remained low. For instance, the ULC growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> was 32.2 % in the period 1973 – 1985 (see Table  1). In that period, due to high production costs, the Turkish economy was unable to compete and eliminate its trade deficit problem. High wage rate growth over the productivity growth of non-tradable goods caused destructive inflation, and high ULC growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> became {{a major factor in}} deepening pressure on the lira and following its depreciations. In that period, the government intervened heavily in the policy of the CBRT over the {{exchange rate}}. Furthermore, high inflation, the high ULC growth of <b>export</b> <b>goods</b> and a compounding trade deficit strongly influenced the decisions of the CBRT, which engineered successive devaluations. Thus, the lira became under-valued between 1973 and 1985 in long-term (see Table  2).|$|R
