When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and {{those parts of the}} hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, and <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E

5|$|In June 1852 Morris entered Oxford University's Exeter College, {{although}} {{since the}} college was full, he only went into residence in January 1853. He disliked {{the college and}} was bored by <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> taught him Classics. Instead he developed {{a keen interest in}} Medieval history and Medieval architecture, inspired by the many Medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain's growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle's book Past and Present (1843), in which Carlyle championed Medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris's dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.|$|E

Most criticisms are aimed at the archaeologists’ decisions to forego any stratigraphic investigations at the site. Olga Linares felt that “good stratigraphic control was sacrificed for expediency. Others have criticized their work for “both lack of control over artifact recording and unclear field notes”.|$|E

25|$|In Western astrology, the {{symbolism}} {{associated with the}} planets also relates to the zodiac signs and houses of the horoscope in their various rulerships. For instance, the description of Mars is masculine, impulsive, and active. Aries is ruled by Mars and has a similar description, representing an active, masculine archetype. Similarly, the first house is also ruled by Mars, and deals with a person's physical health and strength, and <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> project themselves.|$|E
25|$|Since 1970, sociologists Paula LeMasters and Melvin Kohl {{have set}} out {{repeatedly}} to research class based cultures. Class {{culture has been}} shown to have a strong influence on the mundane lives of people, affecting everything from <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> raise their children, initiation and maintenance of romantic relationship to the color in which they paint their houses. The strongest cultural differences seem to run along the professional middle class-working class divide. A recent increase in residential class segregation and the overall tendency of individual to associate mostly with those of equal standing as themselves has further strengthened class differences.|$|E

After being in Elvis' employment for two decades, both Red West and Sonny West were only paid a few weeks' severance pay. Their requests to speak directly to Elvis about their employment termination and the nominal severance pay were not granted.

25|$|Little {{physical}} evidence existed beyond eyewitness descriptions and forensic reports. Police had noted (and {{would continue to}} note) common denominators in the physical characteristics of the victims, and <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> died: all of the victims had been brunette Caucasians; each (excluding Mixer) had been the recipient of extensive violence inflicted with a blunt and/or bladed instrument prior to her murder; each of the victims' bodies had been found within a 15-mile radius of Washtenaw County; and each victim (again excluding Mixer) had received knife wounds to the neck. Furthermore, each victim had been found with an item of clothing tied around her neck, and each woman had been menstruating {{at the time of}} her death. These factors led police to publicly conclude the same perpetrator was responsible for at least three of the murders thus far committed.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are variable in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> reflect human psychological {{reactions to the}} actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes {{the need to be}} aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E
