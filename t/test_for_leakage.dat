50|$|Work {{commenced}} in 1837 {{after many}} years of planning and obtaining legislative support. Testing began in 1848 with the influx of a reduced quantity of water into the system to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> and structural faults. By 1850, part of the canal north of Rome was in service, and the extension to Port Leyden was completed {{by the end of the}} year. In 1855, the entire planned length was finished. Damage from a burst dam in 1869 delayed the canal's opening for that year. By 1887 a repair program was instituted to correct damaged locks, worn by years of use. In 1900, the canal north of Boonville was determined to be uneconomic and was subsequently abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Containers, vessels, enclosures, {{or other}} fluid system are {{sometimes}} tested for leaks - {{to see if}} there is any leakage and to find where the leaks are so corrective action can be taken. There are several methods for leak testing, depending on the situation. Sometimes leakage of fluid may make a sound which can be detected. Tires, engine radiators, and maybe some other smaller vessels may be tested by pressurizing them with air and submerging them in water to see where air bubbles come out to indicate a leak. If submerging in water is not possible, then pressurization with air followed by covering the area to be tested with a soap solution is done to see if soap bubbles form, which indicate a leak. Other types of testing for gas leaks may involve testing for the outleaking gases with sensors which can detect that gas, for example - special sensing instruments for detecting natural gas. U.S. federal safety law now requires natural gas companies to conduct testing for gas leaks upstream of their customer's gas meters. Where liquids are used, special color dyes may be added to help see the leakage. Other detectable substances in one of the liquids may be tested, such as saline to find a leak in a sea water system, or detectable substances may even be deliberately added to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage.</b>|$|E

During field visits {{in areas where the}} dry-press brick previously studied is extensively used, there were reports of leakage in newly constructed walls containing the bricks, which ceased after a period of a year. A common explanation for the increased resistance of the walls to rain penetration was that msall particles of dust and dirt, present in the air, were carried to and into the wall surface by wind and rain, therebly filling the small cracks and openings through which rain might enter.

40|$|DESCARTES is a {{lightweight}} balloon-borne instrument for {{the measurement of}} long-lived trace gases in the stratosphere. The principle behind the instrument is to let a measured amount of air pass through sample tubes containing the adsorbent Carboxen. The trace gases will then be trapped inside the tubes. DESCARTES is, during a flight, capable of taking 15 samples over a range of altitudes. The samples are analysed after recovery of the instrument using a GC-ECD system. With the current setup DESCARTES is optimised for CFC- 11. The objective with {{this study was to}} investigate if quantitative adsorption of CFC- 11 can be secured during sampling with DESCARTES in the stratosphere. In order to study the adsorption efficiency of the sample tubes, double trap experiments were performed to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> of CFC- 11 during sampling. The results indicate that CFC- 11 exhibits an exponentially declining distribution inside the adsorbent tube, giving rise to an exponential increase in breakthrough when sampling continuously. The exponential distribution of CFC in the adsorbent tubes of DESCARTES differs from the common way of seeing the sample tube as a chromatographic column. Furthermore the breakthrough of CFC- 11 seems to increase exponentially when the flow rate is increased. During a normal flight with DESCARTES, samples are taken at pressure levels from 250 up to 20 hPa. Typical sample sizes are between 30 and 200 scc with flow rates varying from 5 to 200 sccm. If a breakthrough of 5 per cent is acceptable most samples taken with DESCARTES can be seen as safe samples when considering the mass flow. The reduced pressure in the stratosphere will however give rise to enlarged sample volumes, resulting in volume flows of 200 to 600 ml/min. Since the important flow parameter when considering breakthrough seems to be somewhere in-between mass flow and volume flow, breakthrough of CFC- 11 exceeding 5 per cent may still be expected due to the high volume flow rates occurring at low pressure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Lightweight Cryptography aims at {{achieving}} secu-rity {{comparable to}} conventional cryptography {{at a much}} lower cost. SIMON is a lightweight alternative to AES, as it shares same cryptographic parameters, but {{has been shown to be}} extremely area-efficient on FPGAs. However, in the embedded setting, protection against side channel analysis is often required. In this work we present a threshold implementation of SIMON. The proposed core splits the information between three shares and achieves provable security against first order side-channel attacks. The core can be implemented in less than 100 slices of a low-cost FPGA, making it the world smallest threshold implementation of a block-cipher. Hence, the proposed core perfectly suits highly-constrained embedded systems including sensor nodes and RFIDs. Security of the proposed core is validated by provable arguments as well as practical DPA attacks and <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> quantification. I...|$|R

It was completed in December 2012 and accepted as a doctoral thesis by the Department of Economics at the University of Munich. It includes five self-contained chapters. The chapters investigate how, in a globalized world, partial international climate policy has shaped international trade and the location of emissions. The main research question is whether carbon leakage empirically occurs, thus undermining the effectiveness of unilateral climate policy. The thesis provides new empirical <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> based on a newly developed panel dataset of the carbon content of bilateral trade and country-level carbon footprints for 40 countries over the period 1995 - 2007. The Kyoto Protocol constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of international climate policy. We exploit policy evaluation techniques to study its effects on CO 2 emissions (Chapter 1), carbon footprints (Chapter 2), trade values (Chapter 3) and the carbon content of trade (Chapter 4). To deal with self-selection into treatment, fixed-effects, instrumental variables or matching econometrics techniques are employed. We find empirical evidence <b>for</b> carbon <b>leakage</b> in the data. The extent of carbon leakage is then quantified with a structurally estimated trade model (Chapter 5).

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{microbial}} microleakage of class V cavities restored with different materials and techniques using a microbial leakage assessment method. Materials and Methods: One hundred extracted, caries-free, human maxillary premolars were randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 : Resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI), Group 2 : Closed sandwich with flowable composite + nanohybrid composite, Group 3 : Nanohybrid composite, Group 4 : Closed sandwich with RMGI + nanohybrid composite, and Group 5 : Flowable composite + nanohybrid composite that were co-cured together (“snow-plow” technique). A microbial penetration method utilizing Streptococcus mutans as an indicator was <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> assessment. Data were analyzed and the significance level was α = 0. 05. Results: The log-rank test indicated a statistically significant difference in leakage rates among the five groups (P = 0. 008).

However, the test alone might not reflect the leakage rate under different levels of vacuum. To study the characteristics of leakage through exhalation valves, a leakage meter was built to measure the leakage rate of four brands of exhalation valves. Seven valves of each brand were <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>leakage</b> rate at pressure drops ranging from 15 to 45 mmH 2 O (or extended to 75 mmH 2 O for some valves).

A leakage data point represented a mean value of five measurements. The results showed that the leakage rate could increase or decrease with increasing pressure drop inside the respirators, indicating that the current method of conducting leakage tests, at a constant suction head of 25 mmH 2 O, does not guarantee better protection than when the respirators are used at a lower suction head.
