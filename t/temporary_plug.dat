40|$|Due to {{downhole}} complexities, shale-gas {{horizontal well}} fracturing in the Sichuan Basin suffered from casing deformation {{and failure to}} apply the technique of cable-conveyed perforation bridge plug. In view of these problems, a new technique of staged volume fracturing with <b>temporary</b> <b>plugging</b> by sand filling is employed. Based on theoretical analyses and field tests, a design of optimized parameters of coiled tubing-conveyed multi-cluster sand-blasting perforation and <b>temporary</b> <b>plugging</b> by sand filling was proposed. It was applied in the horizontal Well ZJ- 1 in which casing deformation occurred. The following results are achieved in field operations. First, this technique enables selective staged fracturing in horizontal sections. Second, this technique can realize massive staged fracturing credibly without mechanical plugging, with the operating efficiency equivalent to the conventional bridge plug staged fracturing. Third, full-hole is preserved after fracturing, thus {{it is possible to}} directly conduct an open flow test without time consumption of a wiper trip. The staged volume fracturing with <b>temporary</b> <b>plugging</b> by sand filling facilitated the 14 -stage fracturing in Well ZJ- 1, with similar SRV to that achieved by conventional bridge plug staged fracturing and higher gas yield than neighboring wells on the same well pad. Thus, a new and effective technique is presented in multi-cluster staged volume fracturing of shale gas horizontal wells...|$|R

Then the pattern is removed along with the channel plug, leaving the mold cavity. The casting liquid (typically molten metal) is then poured into the mold cavity. After the metal has solidified and cooled, the casting is separated from the sand mold. There is typically no mold release agent, and the mold is generally destroyed in the removal process.|$|E
30|$|Haemostasis is {{the process}} by which {{bleeding}} is arrested, when blood vessels are damaged. It occurs in three steps rapidly: vasoconstriction, platelet plug formation and coagulation (fibrin clot formation) (Marieb and Hoehn 2010). Vasoconstriction or vascular spasm involves the constriction of vessels in order to prevent the blood flow. This is followed by the aggregation of platelets, which form a <b>temporary</b> <b>plug</b> at the site of injury, releasing certain chemical messengers such as thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and serotonin. This causes more platelets to arrive at the site of injury, clump together leading to platelet plug formation and is termed as primary haemostasis. The final step of haemostasis (secondary haemostasis) is the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin threads. These fibrin threads along with platelet plug forms a solid clot to seal the injured vessel wall to prevent blood loss (Porrett et al. 2005; Zdanowicz 2002).|$|E

40|$|The <b>temporary</b> <b>plug</b> and {{abandonment}} (P&A) of old wells, and {{the following}} slot recovery, will be important for increasing the average rate of recovery from the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). However, these operations faces challenges like high costs, safety concerns, environmental issues, and rapidly growing demand. Maintaining well integrity may be difficult when re-entering old wells. The demand for increased efficiency may lead operators to compromise on safety to finalize projects in time. This thesis tries to give a broad understanding of the well integrity issues on the NCS, and then tie these ndings around the term slot recovery operations. It {{will be important to}} understand the aspects which aects the lifetime of a well. Especially the long-term pressure, temperature and chemical effects on casings/tubings are important aspects to be understood. If this is done, one can increase the material lifetime in a well, and thus be able to re-use more of the casing strings in a slot recovery. These measures will help to keep marginal fields protable for a longer period. The thesis has also kept a strong focus on the challenges regarding the planning phase of a slot recovery operation. Of the essential factors in a slot recovery is to verify the old barrier envelope, and based on these findings create a robust operational plan. One of the mistakes which has been done in several slot recoveries is that the plan is created before any tests have been done. Once the plan is set and signed by the management, changes are harder to implement. Testing of the well often reveals unexpected factors which needs to be taken into consideration when planning an operation. Two separate slot recovery operations were also studied. They were carefully chosen to highlight typical issues with a slot recovery, and thus show that the theory fits with the reality. The requirements and guidelines for wells on the NCS also needs to be more customized for slot recovery operations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pipe {{freezing}} {{has become}} well established in {{industry as a}} method of short-term isolation in order to carry out maintenance or repairs. A <b>temporary</b> <b>plug</b> is formed by freezing the contents of the pipe (usually water although other fluids, including glycols and hydrocarbons, are possible) over a short length. A review of related research and theory showed that there was little published work on pipe freezing and so a 3 phase experimental investigation was developed to with the aim of increasing knowledge in this field. Phase 1 was to investigate the possibility of using the pipe freezing technique to form an ice plug within a polymer (PVDF) pipe. One side of the plug would then be pressurised to test if the ice plug could be used as temporary pipe isolation. Upon completion, it was found that a pressure retaining ice plug could be formed within the section of pipe and that the pipe showed no obvious signs of damage. Phase 2 was to investigate if a solid ice plug could be formed in a selection of polymer pipes using liquid nitrogen as the coolant, without causing permanent deformation or other damage to the pipes. Secondary objectives of the experiments were to determine, the time taken for ice plugs to form and if the ice plugs could support a 10 bar differential pressure. During these experiments, the method of plug formation within the pipe was observed and the inner and outer pipe wall temperatures recorded with the aim of explaining fully the processes involved in the formation of ice plugs within polymer pipes. On completion of the experiments, it was found that, in most cases it was possible to form ice plugs without apparent damage to the pipes. Phase 3 was to investigate the mechanisms by which the ice plug is retained within the pipe and quantify the force needed to remove a fully formed ice core from a frozen pipe section.

The design developed based on expert knowledge and model simulation covers all areas, including diagnosis to formation damage, acidizing formulation, acidizing technology, operation parameters, fluid discharge, yield increase ratio, and so on. The well was acidized according to the proposal; it achieved excellent performance. Prior to acidizing, the daily liquid production and oil production rates were 12.5 and 7.8  m 3 /day, respectively.

The relative error for the width of artificial fracture decreased to 1 %. The width of natural and artificial fractures in carbonate reservoirs can be estimated by image log data. A series of tests for formation damage were conducted by using the stainless steel simulated core samples flushed with different drilling fluids, such as the sulfonate/polymer drill-in fluid and the solids-free drill-in fluid with or without ideal packing bridging materials. Based on the experimental results using this kind of simulated cores, a novel approach to the damage control of fractured carbonate reservoirs was presented.

Microseismic based fracturing monitoring can be used for real-time imaging of hydraulic fractures, so it has been widely used to evaluate the fracturing effect of shale gas reservoirs and to direct the optimization and adjustment of fracturing parameters. In China, however, the microseismic fracturing monitoring on fracturing of shale gas reservoirs cannot be used to evaluate the fracturing results until the fracturing operation in the pad wells is completed according to the parameters which are designed prior to the fracturing monitoring. Its evaluation results can merely provide a guidance for the fracturing parameters of the next pad wells instead of the wells in operation. As a result, the real-time effect of microseismic fracturing monitoring is out of work.

This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} diversion mechanism in matrix acidizing to increase the flow resistance in highly permeable regions due {{to the presence of}} polymer <b>temporary</b> <b>plugs.</b> In this study, three polymers, namely hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), and xanthan gum were evaluated in the laboratory to determine the best diverting agent to enhance the performance of matrix acidizing. An acidizing system was set-up using coreflooding techniques where Berea sandstone cores saturated with Sarapar were damaged by oil-based mud. Treatment fluids used were mud acid (3 % HF – 12 % HCl), HCl, polymer gels, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) as the mutual solvent. Polymer solutions were prepared at 40 lb/Mgal (4793 ppm) as per field formulation. The experimental results revealed that at low injection pressure, mud acid without diverting agents furnished the best performance where the improvement ratio achieved was 4. 88 at 50 psi (344. 7 kPa), compared with improvement ratio of 2. 42 for HEC, 2. 66 for HPG, and 1. 35 for xanthan gum. However, at higher injection pressure, mud acid with diverting agents gave better results, where at injection pressure of 100 psi (689. 5 kPa), mud acid with HEC diverting agent produced the best result with improvement ratio of 4. 88 compared to 1. 80 for mud acid without diverting agents. Generally, at low injection pressure, mud acid is found to stay longer in the core and has sufficient time to dissolve mud particles. Nevertheless, low injection pressure produces insufficient force to push acid deeper into the formation and fails to dissolve the viscous diverting agents completely. At high injection pressure, there is sufficient force for the acid to dissolve mud particles and viscous diverting agents, hence the diverting agents served its purpose by diverting the mud acid into low permeability zone...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringMany {{of the oil}} and gas {{fields on}} the Norwegian {{continental}} shelf (NCS) are approaching the end of field life. The Petroleum safety authority of Norway is putting pressure on the Exploration and Production (E&P) companies and demanding final field permanent plug and abandonment of several fields within a short period of time. Especially the <b>temporary</b> <b>plugged</b> and abandoned wells [1]. Over the next 5 to 25 years, several thousand wells will need to be plugged and abandoned on the NCS [2]. The conventional method for Plug and abandonment (P&A) includes casing removal by milling operations in order to access the formation for barrier placement. This conventional P&A activity is considered by E&P companies as time consuming, costly and causes additional risks related to health, safety and environment (HSE). Thus a growing interest has been put into finding new methods and solutions to reduce the time and cost of such operations. Archer recognizes this need, and has put effort in developing new intelligent concepts and technical solutions to overcome these challenges. As a result, the Perforate and Wash Tool (PWT) has been introduced. The PWT tool is designed to perforate a selected casing or liner section, wash and clean the perforated section completely, prior to placing a cross sectional cement plug. By eliminating the need for section milling and debris handling, and preparing the seal zone to receive cement, the PWT concept delivers a step change in P&A efficiency and effectiveness. Over the last years this PWT concept has been improved to increase efficiency of the P&A operation. Recently a new technique has been developed for cement placement in the perforated interval to form a permanent P&A barrier. By applying this newest cementing technique, the time to perform the whole plug placement sequence can be reduced significantly. This thesis has examined and present Archers PWT tool and investigated its advancement in the P&A operation. A case study comparing the conventional P&A method of section milling with the PWT concept has been performed. The case compare the methods with respect to time and scope for placing P&A plugs in a production well in the Ekofisk field offshore Norway. The main findings from the case study revealed a potential for significant timesaving by utilizing the PWT methods compared to section milling operations. By applying the new PWT technique the operational time to place P&A barriers in the production well was reduced by 70 %. Considering the amount of wells that are to be plugged the coming years, and the limited availability of rigs, saving time on P&A operations will be crucial for the E&P companies...|$|R

We devised a <b>temporary</b> gel <b>plug</b> that induced lung growth when placed in the fetal trachea. This study evaluates the effects of temporary versus permanent TO on histologic radial alveolar count (RAC) and vascular morphometrics. MethodsExperimental CDH was created surgically in 64 New Zealand White rabbit fetuses on gestational day (GD) 24. On GD 27, these fetuses were randomized to intratracheal instillation of a fibrin gel plug (GP), tracheal suture ligation (SL), intratracheal instillation of normal saline (NS), or sham amniotomy (SH). Non-manipulated fetuses served as controls (NM). Histologic lung sections were assessed blindly for RAC and relative arterial adventitial thickness (%AT) as a variable for vascular remodelling. Results were statistically compared. ResultsRAC was significantly lower in the ipsilateral lung of SH fetuses than in the contralateral lung (p =  0. 011). Mean RAC was higher after SL (p <  0. 001) and GP (p =  0. 03) compared to SH. Furthermore, %AT was higher in GP (50  ±  28, p <  0. 001) and SL (45  ± 2   6, p =  0. 003) fetuses than in controls (36  ±  19).

40|$|A new 160 MeV H- Linac named Linac- 4 will be {{built at}} CERN to replace the old 50 MeV proton Linac. The ion source, the 3 MeV Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and the Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT) line hosting a chopper, have been {{commissioned}} in a dedicated test stand. Wire grids and wire scanners were {{used to measure the}} transverse beam profile and a slit/grid emittance meter was installed on a <b>temporary</b> test bench <b>plugged</b> at the RFQ and MEBT exit in different stages. The emittance meter slit was also used as a scanning scraper able to reconstruct the transverse profile by measuring the transmission with a downstream current transformer. On the same measurement bench, a spectrometer in conjunction with a wire grid allowed measuring the energy spread of the particles. This paper summarizes the measurement results that allowed characterizing the 3 MeV beam and discusses the present understanding of monitor performance...|$|R
50|$|Marcopper Mining was a Canadian {{corporation}} that officially started its copper mining operations in 1969 at the Mt. Tapian Ore Deposit on Marinduque Island in the Philippines. When the Mt. Tapian reserve was depleted in 1990, Marcopper moved its operations to the San Antonio copper mine, three kilometers {{north of the}} Mt. Tapian site. Mine tailings from the Mt. Tapian site were discharged into Calancan Bay. It is estimated that 84 million metric tons of mine tailings were discharged into the shallow bay between 1975 and 1988. Complaints from local residents led to the Mt. Tapian open-cut mine site being converted to receive mine tailings from the San Antonio mine on a <b>temporary</b> basis. Marcopper <b>plugged</b> up the Mt. Tapian pit with a concrete fixture {{to allow it to}} act as a disposal lake for the mining waste. The use of the Tapian Pit as a waste containment system was unconventional. Environmental risk assessment and management had not been carried out by Marcopper.|$|R
40|$|Summary. By {{means of}} field {{observations}} and laboratory experiments on the Malaysian stalk-eyed fly Cyrtodiopsis whitei {{we examined the}} consequences of variation in cop-ulation duration for sperm competition. In this sexually dimorphic species over 90 % of all copulations occur in nocturnal aggregations with from one to four males and up to 24 females. Copulation duration observed in both {{the field and the}} laboratory exhibited a bimodal distribu-tion with peaks at 10 and 50 s. In the field short copula-tions less than 30 s long occurred frequently when more than one male was present in an aggregation but most were not the direct result of male interference. Sperm counts from female spermathecae fter artificial inter-ruptions indicated sperm are not transferred during the first 40 s of a copulation. When solitary males mated up to five times in succession to virgin females, short copulations did not occur, nor was the number of sperm transferred reduced. However, short copulations did oc-cur when we mated isolated females within 6 rain of a previous copulation. By mating irradiated and non-irradiated males in reciprocal pairs we discovered that C. whitei exhibits both first-male sperm precedence and sperm mixing. More than half of the females mated first to sterile and then to fertile males failed to produce off-spring. Such variation in copulation duration and sperm precedence is consistent with male placement and detec-tion of a spermatophore that acts as a <b>temporary</b> mating <b>plug.</b> Our data suggest that those male C. whitei which successfully defend large aggregations of females reduce sperm waste and competition by preferentially transfer-ring sperm to females that have not mated recently...|$|R
40|$|Upon injury, {{selected}} coenocytic algae {{are capable}} of forming <b>temporary</b> wound <b>plugs</b> to prevent detrimental cytoplasmic loss. Wound plugs of Dasycladus vermicularis ([Scropoli] Krasser) were harvested 5 min post injury and dried. The plug material contained 94 % water and {{can be considered a}} hydrogel. The gel plug extended several millimeters from the cut end and filled the space inside the cell wall, which resulted from cytoplasmic retraction. Total organic carbon included 55 % sugars, 5 - 15 % protein and 0. 18 % lipids. The major sugars were glucose, galactose, mannose and galacturonic acid. FITC-lectins specific for these sugars were localized around the plug matrix. Sulfur content calculated as sulfate corresponded to 17 % of the carbohydrate by weight, and sulfated material was detected in plugs by Alcian Blue staining. Formation of the initial plug occurred within one minute of injury and was not significantly perturbed by the addition of ionic, antioxidant, or chelating agents to the seawater medium. However, addition of exogenous D (+) galactose and D (+) glucose prevented formation of the nascent gel plug. Wound plugs that were allowed to form from 10 min up until 24 h post-injury were isolated and incubated with selected biochemical probes in order to identify the biochemical processes involved in plug formation. The kinetics and composition of {{the second phase of the}} wound repair process of Dasycladus vermicularis was investigated using fluorescent probes, chromatography, UV spectroscopy and histochemistry. New evidence supports the hypothesis that the second phase of the wound repair (initiated at 35 - 45 min post injury) is based on the activation of an oxidative burst that produces micromolar H 202 levels. Based on the chemical reactivity of 3, 6, 7 -trihydroxycoumarin, it is suggested that the addition of cellular nucleophiles may serve as the basis for oxidative crosslinking as part of a wound response in injured Dasycladus vermicularis. Finally new evidence supports the hypothesis that an oxidative burst (initiated at 35 - 45 minutes post injury) is regulated by a series of signal transduction events...|$|R
