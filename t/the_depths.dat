5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> I call, Lord, to You), , is {{a church}} cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach.

50|$|The hydrostat is a {{mechanism}} that senses pressure; <b>the</b> torpedo's <b>depth</b> {{is proportional to}} pressure. However, with only a hydrostat controlling <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> fins, <b>the</b> torpedo tends to oscillate around <b>the</b> desired <b>depth</b> rather than settling to <b>the</b> desired <b>depth.</b> <b>The</b> addition of a pendulum allows the torpedo to sense the pitch of the torpedo. The pitch information is combined with <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> information to set <b>the</b> torpedo's <b>depth</b> control fins. <b>The</b> pitch information provides a damping term to <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> control response and suppresses <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> oscillations.|$|R

5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> and duration possible in ambient pressure diving.

5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> of his emotion.

Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
