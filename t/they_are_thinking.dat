When the interviewer asked if the upcoming new release will be put out on Metal Blade Records, Leaman said their deal with them was done and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of releasing it independently.|$|E
25|$|Violence against girls discourages {{them from}} {{attending}} school. Sexual or physical {{violence on the}} way to and from school or at home reduces girls' ability to concentrate in class. Instead of attending to the lesson, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about the violence they have experienced or worrying about future violence to come. Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework. Abused girls {{are more likely to have}} low attainment, more grade repetition and a higher drop-out rate than non-abused girls.|$|E
25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E

6000|$|... "What I <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> about," [...] exclaimed the Daughter of the House, [...] "is {{that poor}} old gentleman in Milan. No {{matter what the}} others were doing, or what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{treating}} him shamefully, and Jaqui was not his friend at all." ...|$|R

500|$|The Protoss are humanoids, [...] {{with two}} {{luminous}} eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers {{flanked by two}} opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting {{from the back of}} the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. The Protoss do not possess any visible ears (but they can hear, as when Terrans speak to them or hear what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking),</b> mouths or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to eat or drink, but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss.|$|E
500|$|Upon joining George Washington, feature {{profiles}} on Watanabe {{were published}} by several popular newspapers, such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. The {{fact that he}} was an Asian player assuming an important role greatly increased his popularity. Half-Chinese player, Zach Chu, who competed with the Richmond Spiders men's basketball team, said, [...] "To see someone of Asian descent, and play as well as he does, it's cool for college basketball, really cool for the Asian community." [...] The George Washington athletics website received the second-most views from Japan in terms of pageviews by country, behind only the United States. On many occasions, he was congratulated on the school's campus itself. Watanabe spoke about his fame and legacy, [...] "Japanese are thinking Americans are bigger and taller and more athletic. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> it's more difficult for Japanese to play in NCAA, but I'm playing right now, so I want to make other people come to the United States." [...] Although Asian players such as Matsui, Jeremy Lin, and Yuki Togashi had been the subject of racist comments in the past, Watanabe was yet to receive racial remarks in his first few years in the United States. Nevertheless, he stated, [...] "If they said something racist, I don't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Some, {{and they}} are not the least intelligent, see the aim of our {{technique}} in the exclusive study of volumes. If they were to add that it suffices, surfaces being the limits of volumes and lines those of surfaces, to imitate a contour in order to represent a volume, we might agree with them; but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> only of the sensation of relief, which we hold to be insufficient. We are neither geometers nor sculptors: for us lines, surfaces, and volumes are only modifications of the notion of fullness. To imitate volumes only would be to deny these modifications for the benefit of a monotonous intensity. As well renounce at once our desire for variety. Between reliefs indicated sculpturally we must contrive to hint at those lesser features which are suggested but not defined." ...|$|E
50|$|For Talese, {{intensive}} reportage {{took the}} form of interior monologue to discover from his subjects what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking,</b> not, he said in a panel discussion reported in Writer's Digest, merely reporting what people did and said.|$|R
60|$|James, meanwhile, {{catching}} the glances which passed between {{his mother and}} Colonel Parsons, understood that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> of the great subject upon which Uncle William was to be consulted. Half scornfully he gave them their opportunity.|$|R
50|$|When a plane disappears for 64 seconds {{just before}} landing, SQ {{is called to}} investigate.

6000|$|... "Not as yet, indeed," [...] replied his dragoman; [...] "but I believe <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of it. As you know, sir, {{it takes}} time to {{introduce}} a custom. Thirty years is but as yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The lover," [...] {{whispered the}} tenor, noticing the {{careless}} approach towards {{us of the}} low comedian, [...] "that's the character <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about all the time--men and women both. It's human nature. Make your lover interesting--that's the secret." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Hoppetty hop! what a ride!' Here I come!' shouted Blockhead-Hans, singing so {{that the}} echoes were roused far and near. But his {{brothers}} were riding slowly in front. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> not speaking, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> over {{all the good things}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to say, for everything had to be thought out.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said Jacinta. [...] "After all, {{there is}} no great credit in telling people of your kind what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking,</b> though I can't help it now and then. You were {{wondering}} what anybody saw in me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then tell me, Ridroonee," [...] said Angut, [...] "is it true what I have heard, {{that your}} countrymen can make marks on flat white stuff, like the thin {{skin of the}} duck, which will tell men far away what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then vanity, {{the vice}} which {{promotes}} so many virtues, asserts itself. He {{looks at his}} comrades and they at him. So far he has shown no sign of weakness. He thinks, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> him brave. The dearly longed-for reputation glitters before his eyes. He executes the orders he receives.|$|E

50|$|The Durians meet up, {{which they}} discuss their future.

6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] said Puss, [...] "Tom {{never had}} a chance with Jinny. Did he, George? Clarence is in high favor now. Did you ever know any one to change so, since this {{military}} business has begun? He acts like a colonel. I hear that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of making him captain of a company of dragoons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{not sorry}} exactly, dear Nic. But I feel uncomfortable and vexed, that after {{screwing}} up my courage, my fidelity, {{to the point}} of going to church, you should have so muddled--managed the matter that it has ended in neither one thing nor the other.

50|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} (March 1, 2014), Kurt Russell recalled a story where he went to Stallone's house to discuss working on a film together.

5000|$|Despite these elements, New Journalism is not fiction. It {{maintains}} {{elements of}} reporting including strict adherence to factual accuracy and the writer being the primary source.

6000|$|... "'Whether {{the boys}} are, at this moment, doing right, or wrong, depends {{not so much}} upon what they are doing, as upon the {{feelings}} of the heart with which they are doing it.

6000|$|This was {{intended}} to be very severe, but Mr. Traffick bore it. It was one of those rough things which Sir Thomas was in the habit of saying, but which really meant nothing. [...] "No. My father is still at his house as yet, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> of going every day. It is about another matter, and I did not want to trouble you with it at home." ...|$|E
60|$|A great {{proportion}} {{of this sort}} of man, this energetic directive sort of man in England, is thinking socialism to-day. They may not be saying socialism, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> it. When labour begins to realise what is adrift it will be divided between two things: between appreciative co-operation, for which guild socialism in particular has prepared its mind, and traditional suspicion. I will not over to guess here which will prevail.|$|E
