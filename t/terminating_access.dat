50|$|Termination {{rates in}} Australia are {{regulated}} by the ACCC. The Mobile <b>Terminating</b> <b>Access</b> Service (MTAS) has been steadily reduced from 21 cents per minute (AUD) in 2004 to 1.7 cents per minute in 2016.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{published}} a 732-page Order on InterCarrier Compensation (ICC), including rules governing revenue sharing. Citing Section 251(b)(5) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC mandated that <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> rates for all calls (not just conference calls) be leveled in 2012 and 2013, then reduced in three increments over the subsequent three years {{until they reach}} $0 in 2017. These mostly sub-1 cent charges are replaced with an access recovery charge (ARC) that is added onto every customers' bill by their phone carriers. In other words, every phone company will get to keep the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges they had to pay out to connect each call while charging consumers more whether they make calls or not. This order has been challenged at the Federal Appeals Court by several parties.|$|E

This is known as reclaiming resources, and is analogous to garbage collection for memory. On many systems the operating system reclaims resources after the process makes the exit system call.|$|E
50|$|Free {{conferencing}} {{is different}} from traditional conference calling in {{that it has no}} organizer fees and allows for multiple people to meet for the price of their long distance connections. Companies that provide free conference call services are usually compensated through a revenue sharing arrangement with the local phone company, sharing the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charge for all incoming calls to a phone carrier.|$|E
50|$|Some {{background}} on the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charge: On every long distance call in the United States including toll conference calls, the consumer is paying for origination (dial tone), transport, and termination (connecting the call). Each of these phone companies share {{a piece of the}} cost of the call. If it is the same phone company performing all three tasks (most likely the two largest phone companies - AT&T and Verizon), they keep all of the charge. This is known as intercarrier compensation (ICC) and is intended to keep the telecommunications system functioning by having every phone company receive compensation for using their network.|$|E

5000|$|For most file systems, {{a program}} <b>terminates</b> <b>access</b> to a file in a {{filesystem}} using the close system call. This flushes buffers, updates file metadata (which may include {{and end of}} file indicator in the data), de-allocates resources associated with the file (including the file descriptor) and updates the system wide table of files in use. Some languages maintain a structure of files opened by its run-time library and may close when the program terminates. Some operating systems will invoke the close if the program terminates. Some operating systems will invoke the close {{as part of an}} operating system recovery {{as a result of a}} system failure.|$|R
50|$|DDR is {{commonly}} configured as a hub and spoke network, where remote sites dial a central site to exchange data. Depending on the needs, the central site {{can also be}} the one to contact the remote sites to retrieve data. Calls are initiated on a per need basis and are shut down once the transmission is <b>terminated.</b> <b>Access</b> Control Lists (ACLs) can be used to restrict which type of traffic is allowed to establish a connection. ACLs can be refined so that the interface is brought up only when the connection established matches a specific set of criteria. These specific criteria are essential to minimizing connections which would otherwise be initiated needlessly, thereby minimizing cost.|$|R
50|$|Flagfall or flag fall is {{a common}} Australian {{expression}} for a fixed start fee, especially in the taxi and haulage and railway industries. From the Australian mobile phone industry, the expression has recently begun to spread to other English language countries, as business jargon for an initial fixed fee for establishing each phone call. The logic behind {{is believed to be}} a method used by Australian mobile phone companies to recover a component of the carriage charges they incur in completing a call to a subscriber being the termination rates, based on the price terms and conditions for the mobile <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> service (MTAS). The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission is reviewing these arrangements.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of free conference calling, the {{conferencing}} company strikes {{an agreement with the}} local phone company that hosts the conferencing bridge to receive a share of the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charge received for connecting the call. At large carriers such as AT&T and Verizon, they keep these access charges for their own conferencing services in addition to charging the customer for the conference service. With free conference calling, as mentioned above, there are no organizer fees so these services do not double-dip: the consumer pays for a regular call with the same three components - origination, transport, and termination - of any call. In other words, the call costs the same as any other call under the customer's calling plan, but the conferencing is included for free to the host and participants of the conference call.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} considers the problem of excessive originating and <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges imposed by some competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) in the United States. The problem arises because the current institutional structure provides an incentive for CLECs to charge for access service in excess of what a competitive market would indicate. An examination of the data shows {{that the problem of}} excessive access charges imposed by CLECs is very real. An analysis of <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges for September 2000 reveals that average <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> charges billed to three interexchange carriers (IXCs) are excessive, exceeding average price cap regulated incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) access charges by 370 - 470 percent. Some solutions to the problem are offered including a first-best solution whereby the calling party would be required to pay for originating access service and have the receiving party pay for <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> service. A second-best solution would be to limit CLEC's access charges to an IXC to be {{less than or equal to}} the access charges of the ILEC with which it directly competes for customers.

40|$|Windowing Toolkit. The {{solution}} to luring attacks {{is to use}} a more restricted stack-frame searching algorithm in checkPrivilege(). This algorithm, which both Netscape and Microsoft use, is shown in figure 3. The algorithm searches the frames on the caller's stack in sequence, from newest to oldest.

The search <b>terminates,</b> forbidding <b>access</b> (and throwing an exception), upon finding a stack frame which is forbidden by the policy engine from accessing the target. This neatly eliminates luring attacks: untrusted code cannot exploit the privileges of its caller, because the stack search will terminate upon finding the untrusted stack frame.

We note that Netscape and Microsoft take different actions when the search reaches the end of the stack uneventfull [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Policymakers {{have long}} invoked {{the concept of}} a âterminating access monopolyâ to inform {{communications}} policy. Roughly speaking, the concept holds that a consumer-facing network provider, no matter how small or how subject to retail competition, generally possesses monopoly power vis-Ã -vis third-party senders of communications traffic to its customers. Regulators and advocates have routinely cited that concern to justify regulatory intervention in a variety of contexts where the regulated party {{may or may not have}} possessed market power in any relevant retail market. Despite the centrality of the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> monopoly to modern communications policy, there is surprisingly little academic literature on that concept as it applies to current regulatory debates. This paper seeks to fill that gap by exploring the various settings in which the concept does, or does not, help explain market dynamics in the communications sector. We conclude that the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> monopoly phenomenon, strictly understood, does not itself generally threaten market failures except in very limited circumstances. As the paper explains, the phenomenon could threaten inefficient outcomes only where, because of the underlying market context, the interconnecting provider or its customer has a particularized need to reach the customer set of the <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> provider, and even then, market forces might correct any problem without regulatory intervention...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effect of access {{regulation}} and retail price regulation of PSTN networks on {{the adoption of a}} new technology in the form of VoIP. The introduction of packet-switched telephony in the form of VoIP raises concerns about current regulatory practice ofï¿½access, whichï¿½has been designed for traditional telephony on PSTN networks. In particular, we show that with endogenous consumer choice between PSTN and VoIP telephony, higher prices for <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> to the PSTN network make VoIP less likely to succeed and lead to lower profits of operators that offer VoIP telephony exclusively. ...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we build}} a simple engineering-economic model to {{evaluate}} the incentives of various network players to deploy distributed storage nodes (content stores and caches) to support information-centric network (ICN) architectures {{and the implications of}} those incentives on protocol design, industry structure and other policy issues, such as competition and network- neutrality. We find that without some explicit monetary compensation from publishers, networks will fail to deploy the socially optimal number of caches. We also study the social welfare implications of different cache deployment scenarios and identify two deployment scenarios that maximize social welfare. Finally, we show that ICN architectures provide numerous opportunities for large eyeball networks to leverage their <b>terminating</b> <b>access</b> monopoly to extract more profits from other network players. Hence, regulators must take steps to address issues such as interconnection and the role of caching infrastructure in differential quality of service provisioning in an ICN-based network architecture, in order to ensure socially desirable outcomes from their deployment...|$|E
40|$|When {{a person}} uses the {{traditional}} wireline telephone network to call another person {{on his cell}} phone, the fixed network must transfer the call to the mobile network to which the recipient subscribes. The fixed network provides originating access for the call, and the mobile network provides <b>terminating</b> <b>access.</b> This paper provides an economic analysis of the regulation of fixed-to-mobile termination rates. Mobile party pays (2 Ì 2 MPP 2 Ì 2) creates better incentives than calling party pays (2 Ì 2 CPP 2 Ì 2) for mobile network operators to place downward pressure on termination rates. Cellular telephone use in the United States and Canada has continued to increase at a significant pace despite the MPP regime and now far exceeds mobile telephone use in countries with CPP regimes. Multiple factors, including substitution possibilities for the callers of mobile subscribers, constrain the market power of mobile operators in setting mobile termination rates under CPP regimes. It is unrealistic for regulators to attempt to set mobile rates, including termination rates, at marginal cost. If large fixed network costs and customer acquisition costs must be recovered from variable charges, then marginal-cost-based pricing is not feasible. Also, the value to callers {{of being able to}} reach mobile subscribers justifies mobile termination charges that exceed marginal cost because of network externalities in mobile telecommunications. Finally, mobile termination rates that exceed marginal cost (or its proxy, long-run average incremental cost) are consistent with Ramsey (quasi-efficient) pricing. To the extent that high termination rates are a problem in countries that have embraced CPP, it is because customers are poorly informed of the charges they pay for their terminating calls. Consumer education would solve the potential market failure without the need to impose price regulation on otherwise competitive markets...|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{has changed}} the social {{patterns}} and the behavior of Indonesian society. It provides business and employment opportunities, {{as well as a}} wide range of information on economic, social, political, and cultural issues. The problem is that the Internet also diminishes real relationships. This has occurred in the community of motorcycle taxis (known in Indonesia as ojek). Formerly, ojek drivers form a community and a physical gathering place. With the development of online technology {{in the form of an}} app called Go-Jek, an online transportation service for motorcycle taxi, drivers no longer meet face to face or come together in one community. The question is thus how Go-Jek drivers interact and relate to each other. The aim of this study is to see the effect of the online application on the community that previously had social relations at its base and were found on every street corner. This is a qualitative research using a phenomenological approach. The findings showed that Go-Jek online <b>terminated</b> <b>access</b> to a real relationship among the drivers and replaced it with an imagined community. Using the analytical perspective of Imagined Communities by Ben Anderson, we find that there is still a sense of solidarity, fraternity, and comradeship among Go-Jek drivers, who are united by design.
