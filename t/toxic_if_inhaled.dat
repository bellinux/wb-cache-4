25|$|Ricin is very <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> injected, or ingested. It {{can also}} be toxic if dust {{contacts}} the eyes {{or if it is}} absorbed through damaged skin. It acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis. It prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger RNA in a process conducted by the cell's ribosome (the protein-making machinery)—that is, the most basic level of cell metabolism, essential to all living cells and thus to life itself. Ricin is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a decent recovery.|$|E

50|$|Thiram is {{moderately}} toxic by ingestion, but it {{is highly}} <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Acute exposure in humans may cause headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints.|$|E
50|$|Uranyl acetate is very <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> ingested, <b>inhaled</b> as dust or by skin contact if skin is cut or abraded. The {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} {{the combined}} effect of chemical toxicity and mild radioactivity and there is a danger of cumulative effects from long term exposure.|$|R
5000|$|Gliotoxin is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> {{swallowed}} or <b>inhaled,</b> and {{can cause}} skin and eye irritation if exposure occurs to these areas. The oral LD50 of gliotoxin is 67 mg/kg. Acute symptoms of gliotoxin start rapidly after ingestion.|$|R
50|$|Cystamine is {{an organic}} disulfide. It is formed when cystine is heated, {{the result of}} decarboxylation. Cystamine is an {{unstable}} liquid and is generally handled as the dihydrochloride salt, C4H12N2S2·2HCl, which is stable to 203-214 °C at which point it decomposes. Cystamine is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> swallowed or <b>inhaled</b> and potentially harmful by contact.|$|R
50|$|MAPP is colorless in both {{liquid and}} gas form. The gas has a {{pronounced}} acetylene-like or fishy odor at concentrations above 100 ppm, {{due to the}} addition of substituted amines as a polymerization inhibitor. Low molecular weight alkynes have strong odors. MAPP gas is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> at high concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Acetyl cyanide's {{toxicological}} properties {{have not}} been thoroughly investigated. However, {{it is known that}} the molecule is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> and would cause a respiratory tract irritation. Also the chemical may cause skin irritation if absorbed through the skin. The compound's toxic affects would target the peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, and the blood stream.|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of plutonium oxide {{in the body}} varies with {{the way in which}} it is taken. Since it is insoluble, when ingested, a very large percentage of it will be eliminated from the body quite rapidly in body wastes.In particulate form, plutonium oxide at a particle size less than 10 micrometers (0.01 mm) is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> due to its alpha-emission.|$|E
5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is <b>toxic</b> as well <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or ingested.|$|R
50|$|Inhalation {{and skin}} contact are {{expected}} to be the primary ways of occupational exposure to this chemical. Based on single exposure animal tests, it is considered to be slightly <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> swallowed or <b>inhaled,</b> moderately <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> absorbed through skin as well as being corrosive to eyes and skin. Vapor may be irritating to the eyes and upper respiratory tract. Temporary and reversible visual disturbances characterized by mildly blurred vision, a blue-gray discolorization of sight (blue haze) or halo vision (appearance of a halo when looking at light sources) may also occur.|$|R

50|$|The {{community}} of Eight Mile, Alabama had a spill {{of the natural}} gas odorant within their community in 2008. Residents continue to experience these symptoms under their long term exposure to mercaptan. The residents say they got {{very little of the}} assistance provided to Porter Ranch residents. Methyl mercaptan is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> according to its MSDS sheet. However, it is considered fairly harmless by government and industry officials. Whether it {{is the source of the}} illnesses in Porter Ranch and Eight Mile has been a subject of debate.|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectroplating {{workers are}} using {{chromium}} during the working process. Clinical and laboratory {{evidence indicates that}} exposure of chromium is very <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> it is <b>inhaled</b> {{and can lead to}} oxidative DNA damage. This study was aimed to investigate factors associated to the urinary 8 - OHdG levels as a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage. Sixty six subjects from electroplating home industry in Tegal, Central Java were included. Urinary chromium levels were determined using AAS. The urinary 8 -OHdG level as oxidative DNA damage was measured using ELISA. The levels of chromium in all sample were higher than the normal range (median 11. 77 μg/L), the median of urinary 8 -OHdG level was 23. 83 ng/ml. Eventhough, age and urinary chromium level were not associated with urinary 8 -OHdG's levels, there was a significant association between the period of works and the type of jobs to the urinary 8 - OHdG levels...|$|R

50|$|Cyanogen iodide is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or {{ingested}} and may {{be fatal}} if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Cyanogen iodide may cause convulsions, paralysis and death from respiratory failure. It is a strong irritant and may cause burns to the eyes and skin if contact is encountered. If cyanogen iodide is heated enough to undergo complete decomposition, it may releases toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides, cyanide and iodide. A fire may cause the release of poisonous gas. Cyanogen iodide decomposes when contacted with acids, bases, ammonia, alcohols, and with heating. ICN slowly reacts with water or carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{refrigerator}} to see {{widespread use}} was the General Electric [...] "Monitor-Top" [...] refrigerator introduced in 1927, so-called {{because of its}} resemblance to the gun turret on the ironclad warship USS Monitor of the 1860s. The compressor assembly, which emitted {{a great deal of}} heat, was placed above the cabinet, and enclosed by a decorative ring. Over a million units were produced. As the refrigerating medium, these refrigerators used either sulfur dioxide, which is corrosive to the eyes and may cause loss of vision, painful skin burns and lesions, or methyl formate, which is highly flammable, harmful to the eyes, and <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or ingested. Many of these units are still functional today, after requiring little more service than a replacement start relay or thermostat if at all. These cooling systems cannot legally be recharged with the hazardous original refrigerants if they leak or break down.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnder-expanded particle-laden flows {{resulting}} in velocities {{greater than the}} local speed of sound are a feature of a wide number of applications in aviatic, astronautical, and process engineering scenarios including those relating to the accidental release of high-pressure fluids from reservoirs or pipelines. Such pipelines {{are considered to be}} the most likely method for transportation of captured carbon dioxide (CO 2) from power plants and other industries prior to subsequent storage in carbon capture and storage (CCS) applications. Their safe operation is of paramount importance as their contents are likely to be in the region of several thousand tonnes. CO 2 poses a number of dangers upon release due to its physical properties. It is a colourless and odourless asphyxiant which has a tendency to sublimation and solid formation, and is directly <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> in air at concentrations around 5 %, and likely to be fatal at concentrations around 10 %. The developments presented in this paper concern the formulation of a multi-phase homogeneous discharge and dispersion model capable of predicting the near-field fluid dynamic, phase and particle behaviour of such CO 2 releases, with validation against measurements of laboratory-scale jet releases of CO 2 recently obtained by our group...|$|E

40|$|Procedures for {{preparing}} fatty acid methyl esters from for-ages using single-step transesterifi cation {{have been well}} doc-umented. Outen et al. (1976) demonstrated a one-step extraction and esterifi cation method using benzene and 5 % methanolic HCl. Sukhija and Palmquist (1988) later recommended that benzene or toluene be used for extraction and formation of methyl esters. The use of benzene and toluene is now discouraged due to high toxicity and carcinogenic properties (USEPA, 2002). Recogniz-ing the hazards of benzene and toluene, Whitney et al. (1999) substituted these solvents with 7 % (1. 03 M) BF 3 in CH 3 OH for direct transesterifi cation of feedstuff s. Although BF 3 {{has proven to be}} an eff ective catalyst for direct transesterifi cation of fatty acids in forages (Whitney et al., 1999) and animal tissues (Rule, 1997), it is highly volatile and can be <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> (NIOSH, 2004). Boron-trifl uoride also must be sealed with N 2 and stored in a cool, dark environment to main-tain reactivity. In contrast, methanolic HCl is less volatile than BF 3, maintains shelf-life longevity without special preparation, and costs substantially less than BF 3. Garcés and Mancha (1993) demonstrated that methanolic HCl is an effi cient catalyst {{for preparing}} fatty acid methyl esters, with solubility of transmethylated end products a factor limiting its utility. However, we have overcome potential problems wit...|$|E
40|$|Picloram kills or damages annual and {{perennial}} broadleaf {{herbs and}} woody plants. It {{acts as an}} “auxin mimic ” or synthetic growth hormone that causes uncontrolled and disorganized growth in susceptible plants. Picloram does not bind strongly with soil particles and is not degraded rapidly in the environment, allowing it to be highly mobile and persistent (half-life of picloram in soils can range from one month to several years). In soils, picloram is degraded primarily by microbial metabolism, {{but it can be}} degraded by sunlight when directly exposed in water or on the surface of plants or soil. Picloram can move off-site through surface or subsurface runoff and has been found in the groundwater of 11 states. Picloram may also “leak ” out of the roots of treated plants, and be taken up by nearby, desirable species. Picloram is not highly toxic to birds, mammals, and aquatic species. Some formulations are highly <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> while other formulations can cause severe eye damage if splashed into the eyes. Because of the persistence of picloram in the environment, chronic exposure to wildlife is a concern, and studies have found weight loss and liver damage in mammals following long term exposure to high concentrations. Concentrations in runoff reported by researchers are often adequate to prevent the growth of non-target terrestrial and aquatic plants, and therefore, picloram should not be applied near waters used for irrigation...|$|E
40|$|Author's Note: When {{concerning}} reptiles, {{the terms}} poisonous and venomous require redefining. Poison is <b>toxic</b> <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or ingested. The only poisonous reptiles known in Australia are the Green Turtle and the Hawksbill Turtle. More people have probably died {{on this earth}} {{as a result of}} consuming turtle flesh than ever has been the case from snakebite in Australia. There are no reported deaths from turtle poisoning here since 1945. Venom is generally harmless if ingested but toxic when it comes in contact with the underlying tissue normally protected by the skin. Venomous animals have to break the skin with body-spines, stings or teeth (includes fangs in spiders and centipedes). The only venomous reptiles found in Australia are snakes. For too long we have been telling the world, as well as each other, that Australia's snakes are the most venomous. On what evidence do we make this assumption? Solely on their ability to kill mice! What a joke! The basis for the following discussion and points of view are personal experience, comments heard and questions asked during my time lecturing on venomous animals as well as a perusal of the relevant literature. I might just mention here that I have never lectured to mice! I have heard it said many times by people I believe should know better that this or that Australian snake is "more deadly", "more toxic " or "more venomous " than the Indian Cobra (Naja naja). This is a misrepresentation of th...|$|E
