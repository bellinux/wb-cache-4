40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the uncertificated securities in the context of financial law. Proper and prudential legal regulation of the securities is considered to be key element of efficient financial markets of which the importance for the economics is systematically growing in past few decades. From the beginning, financial markets were dominated by certificated securities represented by legal fiction incorporating rights arising from the security into a certificate and considering this certificate as a <b>tangible</b> <b>movable</b> asset. In the consequence of the development of financial markets and securities trading uncertificated securities were developed to make transfers of the securities and asset management feasible. Uncertificated securities can be defined as substitutable physical securities incorporating private rights which are prerequisite for the exercise and transfer of those rights and which are replaced by a record entered in the central register of securities, mainly central securities depositories. The form of the uncertificated securities determines the necessity of their special legal regulation taking into account their legal nature and connected legal aspects of record keeping. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse relevant Czech legislation and highlight both [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the debate}} about {{indigenous}} cultural property, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of the United States has developed and implemented an unorthodox concept of "cultural affiliation. ” The act entitles Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to claim repatriation of their cultural property—comprising human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony—upon {{the establishment of a}} specific shared group identity and a cultural affiliation to an object. The concept of cultural affiliation in the act replaces proof of ownership, or proof that an object was stolen or illicitly removed. It thereby amends traditional standards saturated in notions of property and ownership that have perpetuated since Roman law and allows the evolution of a control regime over cultural property that takes into account the cultural aspects of the objects. On an international level, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) of 2007 stipulates a similar emancipation of indigenous peoples' cultural property claims from notions of property and ownership. This article explores NAGPRA's cultural affiliation concept as it stands between private property and human rights law and brings into focus the concept's elements that go beyond traditional property law. It ultimately looks at the potential and limits of the concept from an international perspective as a standard for other countries that consider implementation of UNDRIP's provisions on indigenous, <b>tangible,</b> <b>movable</b> cultural propert...|$|E
40|$|The doctrinal {{analysis}} and legal {{regulation of the}} legal nature of the securities in Latvian law is fragmented and unclear. This paper discovers that according to the prevailing legal doctrine the securities are classified as intangibles under Latvian law and {{that leads to the}} exclusion of the dematerialized securities from the context of the property law. In contrast the bearer debt securities due to their dual legal nature get the legal treatment associated with the <b>tangible</b> <b>movables,</b> including the right to raise property claim and the protection of the bona fide acquirer, while other securities as intangibles do not have the benefit of these substantial property law rules, which leads to the significant legal uncertainty in case of the unauthorized transfer of the securities. The research takes the comparative approach, since historically Latvian securities law has experienced significant influence of the German law...|$|R

The French enforcement procedure in the case of immovable property (saisieimmobilière) differs with respect to that in Spain, in the fact that judicial intervention is always needed. The judicial intervention will take place either via a huissier (bailiff) or the enforcement judge directly (juged’exécution). Like in Spain, the execution of fixed charge/security over a movable property (mise à exécution d’un gage ou d’un nantissement) can be either judicial or extrajudicial. 62 [...]...|$|R

However, we appreciate that article 1275 of the Civil Code does not apply in all situations of successive transfers relating to <b>movable</b> <b>tangible</b> property granted by the same legal subject. Corroborating this text with the norms in article 937 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code and article 1273 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code it leads to the solution according to which article 1275 of the Civil Code regards only the cases where the transfer of successive property are of the same nature, the onerous primary act has not resulted in immediate transmission of real previous right of the document with the free subsidiary title and when the primal act is free, and the alternative is onerous.

Classical massage is a form of mechanotherapy that affects the regulation of the work of muscles, joints, tendons and ligaments. Aim of work: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of classical massage section of thoracolumbar spine to increase the mobility in these segments. Material: The study was carried out on 36 healthy volunteers (20 women and 16 men) aged 21 to 27 years old (average age - 23. 8) who were subjected to a series of five classical massages (according to strictly established protocol). In order to objectify the effects in all subjects before and after a series of treatments the following measurements were made: the fingers-floor test; the Otto -Wurna test; the straightening of the spine; lateral flexion of the spine; twist of the spine. Results A statistically important difference has been shown in the results of all tested variables before the first and after the last treatment of classical massage. Conclusions The results of personal research apply to young, healthy volunteers. It is worth to continue research into the effects of this form of therapy in the case of restrictions of <b>movable</b> <b>tangible</b> property, resulting from spinal pain syndromes...|$|R
40|$|Historic urban landscapes are a {{challenge}} to urban planning, especially whose cultural heritage and significance has been acknowledge and designated. They require informed decision-making, {{not only on the}} impact of development in natural environment, but also, on its cultural resources, <b>tangible</b> and intangible, <b>movable</b> and immovable. The last decades a broadening can be noticed in heritage definitions, designations and management, from singular objects towards entire landscapes. That entails a similar widening in disciplines involved in heritage management and the integration of socio-economic and environmental values amongst others. This evolution in heritage management, fostered in the 2011 UNESCO Recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL approach) rooted in previous Charters and Recommendations, acknowledges the desirability to integrate heritage in environmental planning and management. Though, the context did change and urban resources are under greater development pressures. This way, the HUL approach could be seen as a tool to assist the implementation of procedures aimed at integrating heritage, handling side by side strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, in cities where heritage is both a driver and target of economic growth. This paper aims to take the city of Cuenca (Ecuador) as case study, inscribed on the World Heritage List since 1999, to discuss how the HUL approach can improve heritage management. The case of Cuenca revealed that despite outdated planning policies and regulations, pioneer efforts have been made to provide the city with more holistic tools in heritage management. A close cooperation between local government, academics, local stakeholders and students are laying the basis for the HUL approach. This paper evaluates the outcomes of its first stages, the significance assessment of Cuenca’s resources. It compares these outcomes with the state-of-the-art. These results will enable the implementation of HUL to be evaluated and further developed, as well as, to contribute to innovation in heritage management. status: publishe...|$|R
