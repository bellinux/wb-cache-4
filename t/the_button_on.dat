5|$|The girl can {{stabilize}} wobbling dishes {{by pressing}} <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller. If a plate falls, the player {{is able to}} capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears {{at the top of}} the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} a skeet shooter who {{is shooting}} clay pigeons. By pressing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the controller, a clay pigeon is sent out and pressing the button again will shoot; moving the joystick changes the gun's angle. A point is earned if the bullet hits. Difficulty varieties adjust {{the speed of}} the pigeons.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, The Coup {{released}} Party Music {{to widespread}} praise. However, {{in part because}} of distribution problems, sales of the album were low. The original album cover art depicted group members Pam the Funkstress and Riley {{standing in front of the}} twin towers of the World Trade Center as they are destroyed by huge explosions, and Riley is pushing <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> a guitar tuner. The cover art was finished in June 2001 and the album was scheduled to be released in mid-September. However, in response to the uncanny similarity of the artwork with the September 11, 2001, attacks, the album release was delayed until November of that year with the cover featuring a hand with a flaming martini glass.|$|E

25|$|The {{team that}} earned the most number of {{pendants}} {{by the end}} of three temple games won the right to enter the temple. In the event that the two teams earned the same number of pendants after the three temple games, the teams played a tiebreaker to determine who advanced to the temple. The teams stood behind a tiebreaker pedestal, and Fogg (since Season 2, Olmec) asks a tiebreaker question to determine the winner. The first team to hit <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> top of their gong was given the chance to answer the question. A correct answer allowed the team to go to the temple. Originally, a team that buzzed in and gave an incorrect answer or ran out of time automatically lost, allowing the other team to advance to the temple by default. However, in Seasons 2 and 3, the other team was required to answer the question correctly to go to the temple.|$|E
500|$|Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen {{stated that}} the {{restoration}} of the visible Start button was intended to be a [...] "warm blanket" [...] for users who had become confused by the removal of <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> 8; the Start button was originally removed to reflect Windows 8's treatment of the desktop as an [...] "app" [...] rather than the main interface.|$|E
500|$|Tennis for Two {{was first}} shown on October 18, 1958. The game was {{rendered}} as a horizontal line, representing the tennis court, {{and a short}} vertical line in the center, representing the tennis net. The first player would press <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> their controller to send the ball, a point of light, over the net, and it would either hit the net, reach {{the other side of}} the court, or fly out of bounds. The second player could then hit the ball back with their controller while it was on their side, either before or after it bounced on the ground. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut. Higinbotham claimed later that [...] "the high schoolers liked it best, you couldn't pull them away from it." [...] Due to the game's popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity. Players could set the game to simulate the gravity levels of the Moon or Jupiter. Higinbotham referred to the game as Tennis for Two, though a placard attached to the 1959 version titled it [...] "Computer Tennis". After the 1959 exhibition, the game was dismantled so its components could be put to other uses.|$|E

500|$|Ars Technica panned the new Tablet mode {{interface}} {{for removing}} the charms and app switching, making the Start button harder to use by requiring users {{to reach for}} <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the bottom-left {{rather than at the}} center of the screen when swiping with a thumb, and for making application switching less instantaneous through the use of Task View. Microsoft Edge was praised for being [...] "tremendously promising", and [...] "a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows8 as being a [...] "reliable" [...] platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows10 was considered [...] "the best Windows yet" [...] and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be [...] "comfortable and effective" [...] across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch. ExtremeTech felt that Windows10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that [...] "it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum." ...|$|E
500|$|Burke {{performed}} Bad Boys on {{the sixth}} series of The X Factor 's first week results show on 11 October 2009. Flo Rida joined Burke on stage. She then performed the on GMTV on 13 October 2009 at London's G-A-Y and at Wembley Arena on 17 October 2009. She also performed it on Ireland's Childline concert in Dublin. Burke also performed the song, {{as well as others}} from her while presenting the launch of the Viva Network in the UK and Ireland. She returned for the finale of the sixth series of The X Factor, where she and past runner-up JLS performed a melody of the song and their hit, [...] "Everybody in Love". Burke also performed the song at The O2 Arena in London for the Jingle Bell Ball, while also appearing on Cheryl Cole's Night In to perform the solo version. [...] "Bad Boys" [...] was also the background music in Dancing On Ice during the first week when introducing the male celebrities. In week seven of the fifth season of Dancing on Ice, actress Emily Atack danced to the song and achieved her highest score at the time in the show. In the UK, Burke also performed it on Ant and Dec's Push <b>The</b> <b>Button</b> <b>on</b> 13 March 2010, and is set to perform it on T4 on the Beach on 4 July 2010. [...] Burke also performed the song while promoting Overcome on her European Promo Tour.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} this rocky start, CAP became an {{official}} [...] "hearts and minds" [...] civic action program, and a school of sorts was eventually established near Da Nang. Training was brief (ten days) and covered a few bare essentials – some Vietnamese phrases, customs, and culture, some civic action precepts, and some military topics – far too short to be of much real good, though {{a step in the}} right direction. Upon graduation, you were posted to your unit. Eventually they began issuing certificates showing you had graduated. Initially, CAP Marines were issued a special cloth and leather insignia to be worn from <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the breast pocket of the uniform jacket. These were later replaced by handsome enameled metal pins, also made to be worn on the breast pocket. These, however, were easily lost, and also made a good aiming point for the enemy. They were usually dispensed with on patrols.|$|E

5000|$|One notable aspect was the {{original}} Ambra mouse, which differed from almost all other designs {{in the position of}} its buttons.

The Ambra mouse had <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front, either side of the cable: the user clicked by pulling their finger backward, {{in a manner similar to}} squeezing a trigger. Criticisms led to Ambra changing to a more conventional design: one UK magazine review described the mouse as [...] "looking like a torture device." ...|$|R

2500|$|Early on, AMT chassis {{were often}} made of metal, but later, they were usually {{a single piece}} of plastic with lower engine, exhaust and {{suspension}} details molded in a single piece with metal axles fitted through holes in the sides of the plastic. Normally, on the chassis, there were no operating suspension parts. Wheels were one-piece plastic pressed onto the axles. With parts typically [...] "melted" [...] together, forming a permanent bond, promotional models were much more durable than their counterpart assembled kits. Of course, promotionals were simpler and had fewer parts than kits which were a later marketing ploy to enhance sales. Hoods did not normally open and suspension details were molded into the chassis. One exception to this was the 1962 Ford Fairlane promo which had an opening hood and a detailed engine (Doty 1999a, pp88-89). Beyond this, extras were not often built in, but there were occasional surprises like <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the 1959 [...] "Wide Track" [...] Pontiacs which pushed the wheels inward toward the body to simulate how wide the new cars were (Doty 1999b, p87).|$|E

60|$|That must {{be stopped}} {{immediately}} at all costs, before any {{attempt was made to}} get the man out, or he would bleed to death. Both boys saw this on the instant, and without a word Pat stooped and gripped the arm above the cut, bringing to bear all the strength of his powerful fingers. The effect was immediately apparent. The wound still bled, but no longer in those fateful jets. Sparrer meanwhile had snatched off his neckerchief and was preparing a tourniquet. From a shrub by the roadside he cut a stout stick a foot long, then hastily made search for a smooth pebble. Finding none he started to feel in his pockets for some small object that would serve his purpose when his alert glance fell on Pat's mackinaw. Whipping out his knife once more he cut one of the big smooth buttons from the mackinaw. Tying the handkerchief loosely around the injured arm just above where Pat was gripping it he slipped the button in so that it rested directly on the artery. Then putting the stick under the handkerchief on the outer side he rapidly twisted it until the pressure of <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the artery was sufficient to stop the flow of blood and Pat could release his grip. The stick was then tied so that it could not untwist, and they were ready for the next move.|$|E

Oh, yes, that 's what I thought of you! Blanche knew why I picked her out, and undertook to supply the article required. Heaven forgive her! She has certainly kept her engagement. But you can imagine how it must have made her like me--knowing why I picked her out! She has disappointed me all the same. I thought she had a heart; but that was a mistake.
