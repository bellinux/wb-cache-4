40|$|A {{method for}} {{assembling}} patterned crystalline arrays of colloidal particles using ultraviolet illumination of an optically-sensitive semiconducting anode while using the anode to apply an electronic {{field to the}} colloidal particles. The ultraviolet illumination increases current density, and consequently, {{the flow of the}} colloidal particles. As a result, colloidal particles can be caused to migrate from non-illuminated areas of the anode to illuminated areas of the anode. Selective illumination of the anode can also be used <b>to</b> <b>permanently</b> <b>affix</b> colloidal crystals <b>to</b> illuminated areas of the anode while not <b>affixing</b> them <b>to</b> non-illuminated areas of the anode...|$|R
50|$|Newton {{completes the}} {{spaceship}} {{and attempts to}} take it on its maiden voyage amid intense press exposure. However, just before his scheduled take-off, he is seized and detained, apparently by the government and a rival company; his business partner, Farnsworth, is murdered. The government, which has apparently been told by Bryce that Newton is an alien, holds him captive in a locked luxury apartment, constructed deep within a hotel. During his stay, they keep him sedated with alcohol (to which he has become addicted) and continuously subject him to rigorous medical tests - notably one involving X-rays which causes the contact lenses he wears as part of his human disguise <b>to</b> <b>permanently</b> <b>affix</b> themselves <b>to</b> his eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Efforts on {{the first}} {{reconstruction}} began with a [...] "process of familiarisation" [...] with the various fragments; each piece was traced and detailed on a [...] "piece of stiff card", until after [...] "a long while" [...] reconstruction could commence. For this, Maryon sculpted [...] "a head of normal size" [...] from plaster, then [...] "padded the head out above the brows {{to allow for the}} thickness of the lining which a metal helmet would naturally require." [...] The fragments of the skull cap were then initially stuck to the head with Plasticine, or, if thicker, placed into spaces cut into the head. Finally, [...] "strong white plaster" [...] was used <b>to</b> <b>permanently</b> <b>affix</b> the fragments, and, mixed with brown umber, fill in the gaps between pieces. Meanwhile, the fragments of the cheek guards, neck guard, and visor were placed onto shaped, plaster-covered wire mesh, then affixed with more plaster and joined to the cap.|$|R

5000|$|Maryon's [...] "work on {{the helmet}} was {{full-time}} and continuous and took six months." [...] Much like {{with the second}} reconstruction, efforts began with a [...] "process of familiarisation" [...] with the various fragments; each piece was traced and detailed on a [...] "piece of stiff card," [...] until after [...] "a long while" [...] reconstruction could commence. For this, Maryon formed [...] "a head of normal size" [...] from plaster, then [...] "padded the head out above the brows {{to allow for the}} thickness of the lining which a metal helmet would naturally require."

The reconstruction finished, Maryon published a paper detailing the helmet in a 1947 issue of Antiquity.|$|R

5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, <b>to</b> a <b>permanently</b> <b>affixed,</b> folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and clutch master cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|R
