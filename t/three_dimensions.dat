Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E

Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} mobile {{location}} estimation in <b>three</b> <b>dimension</b> space. We build up a 3 -D signal propagation model, namely the <b>three</b> <b>dimension</b> Ellipse Propagation Model (3 DEPM), which {{is an extension of}} the Ellipse Propagation Model(EPM) from our previous study [1]. Then we use a <b>three</b> <b>dimension</b> Geometric Algorithm (3 -D Geometric Algorithm) to calculate the location of the Mobile Station(MS). The 3 -D Geometric Algorithm is an extension of the Geometric Algorithm, which can provide a 3 -D estimation instead of an estimation on a 2 -D Plane. Thus, this study is a meaningful work for locating a mobile station based on the mobile and wireless networks such that it can be a guideline for our future research on mobile computing. ...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to <b>three</b> <b>dimensions.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the first}} of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons, whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into <b>three</b> <b>dimensions</b> in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to <b>three</b> <b>dimensions,</b> namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
