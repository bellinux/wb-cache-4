These two contributions have been measured separately, and there is good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> at large bend radii can be considerably greater than the uniform bend loss. It is found that the <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> incurred by a change of fibre curvature from R to -R is about 8 times bigger than that from R to infinity.

40|$|Curvature of a {{single-mode}} {{optical fibre}} {{gives rise to}} two principal forms of additional transmission loss, namely <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> and pure bend loss. The <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> and the associated ray radiation, which have been observed {{at the beginning of}} a bend, can be satisfactorily explained by a modified coupled mode theory. The radiation modes are represented by a quasi-guided mode having an average propagation constant beta(e). The introduction of a gradual change of curvature reduces the <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> much more than the pure bend loss. Analysis of the microbending loss shows that the transition component is a maximum at a given correlation length which can be simply expressed in terms of beta(e).

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{literature on}} legal transitions {{has formed a}} general position in favor of establishing a governmental transition policy; the primary debate concerns whether the policy {{should be one of}} systematically mitigating or not mitigating <b>transition</b> <b>losses.</b> Arguments on both sides generally have assumed a sharp dichotomy between a substantive legal change and the transition treatment associated with the substantive change. Focusing on federal tax legislation, this article challenges that assumption and the normative conclusions that it supports. Specifically, this article identifies compromise as {{an important component of the}} tax legislative process and argues that the ability to provide or not to provide transition relief on an ad hoc basis facilitates such compromise. A policy either to mitigate or not to mitigate tax <b>transition</b> <b>losses</b> would remove this mechanism and, consequently, would cause legislators to pursue compromise through other means, such as by scaling back the substantive policy changes they otherwise would enact. This effectively tilts substantive tax policy toward the status quo. The analysis yields three main conclusions. First, tax transition policy is not exogenous to substantive tax policy. Second, the likely effects of tax transition policy on the development of substantive tax policy raise doubts about the normative arguments that have been made for tax transition policy. Finally, contrary to the general consensus of the literature, the ad hoc approach to tax transitions in current practice yields results that may be no less desirable than the results of following a formal tax transition policy...|$|R

40|$|In this Article, Professor Lois R. Lupica {{examines}} {{whether the}} electric utility industry, currently j. n {{the midst of}} deregulation, ought to sustain the resulting transition losses. Due to the signifi· cant modification of legal rules affecting the electric power market and changes in regulatory policy, the utilities currently have expenditures and expectations that are unrecoverable in a competitive market. In recent years, momentum has moved {{in the direction of}} compensating the electric utilities and their investors for these losses. Professor Lupica challenges the arguments for transition loBS recovery and ultimately concludes that the doctrinal premises in support oftransition loss recovery are flawed. The Article begins by examining the history of the electric power market and continues by addressing the central arguments in favor oftransition loss recovery. Proponents oftransition loss recovery argue that investors will suffer losses as a result ofa change in market dynamics or legal rules, and because the changes were not foreseeable, investors should be insulated from these resulting losses. Advocates of <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> recovery further perceive the regulatory environment as contract-based, and thus argue that the modification ofthe market 2 ̆ 7 s legal rules constitutes a breach ofcontract. Finally, some advocates claim that changes in legal rules and the resulting transition losses is a taking of property under the Fifth Amendment. Professor Lupica addresses each of these arguments and contends that the premises underlying these arguments are faulty. She further argues that transition losses are not unique to this context, and that, in addition to acknowledging the doctrinal challenges to recovery advocates 2 ̆ 7 arguments, policy makers must evaluate <b>transition</b> <b>loss</b> recovery as an issue of fundamental fairness to utility consumers...|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} advantages to exploiting diffraction-limited instrumentation at astronomical observatories, which include smaller footprints, less mechanical and thermal instabilities {{and high levels}} of performance. To realize such instrumentation it is imperative to convert the atmospheric seeing-limited signal that is captured by the telescope into a diffraction-limited signal. This process can be achieved photonically by using a mode reformatting device known as a photonic lantern that performs a multimode to single-mode transition. With the aim of developing an optimized integrated photonic lantern, we undertook a systematic parameter scan of devices fabricated by the femtosecond laser direct-write technique.

40|$|Single-mode {{waveguide}} designs frequently support {{higher order}} transverse modes, usually {{as a consequence}} of process limitations such as lithography. In these systems, it is important to minimize coupling to higher-order modes so that the system nonetheless behaves single mode. We propose a variational approach to design adiabatic waveguide connections with minimal intermodal coupling. An application of this algorithm in designing the “S-bend” of a whispering-gallery spiral waveguide is demonstrated with approximately 0. 05 dB insertion loss.

40|$|Fetal {{stem cells}} differ phenotypically and {{functionally}} from {{adult stem cells}} in diverse tissues. However, {{little is known about}} how these differences are regulated. To address this we compared the gene expression profiles of fetal versus adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and discovered that the Sox 17 transcriptional regulator is specifically expressed in fetal and neonatal but not adult HSCs. Germline deletion of Sox 17 led to severe fetal hematopoietic defects, including a lack of detectable definitive HSCs. Conditional deletion of Sox 17 from hematopoietic cells led to the loss of fetal and neonatal but not adult HSCs. HSCs stopped expressing Sox 17 approximately 4 weeks after birth. During this <b>transition,</b> <b>loss</b> of Sox 17 expression correlated with slower proliferation and the acquisition of an adult phenotype by individual HSCs.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{significantly}} reducing the losses {{associated with an}} on/off controlled hydraulic system is proposed. There has been a growing interest {{in the use of}} on/off valves to control hydraulic systems as a means of improving system efficiency. While on/off valves are efficient when they are fully open or fully closed, a significant amount of energy can be lost in throttling as the valve transitions between the two states when the switching times are not negligible. A soft switching approach is proposed as a method of eliminating the majority of these <b>transition</b> <b>losses.</b> The operating principle of soft switching is that fluid can temporarily flow through a check valve or into a small chamber while valve orifices are partially closed. The fluid can then flow out of the chamber once the valve has fully transitioned. Thus, fluid flows through the valve only when it is in its most efficient fully open state. A model of the system is derived and simulated, with results indicating that the soft switching approach can reduce <b>transition</b> and compressibility <b>losses</b> by 81 % and total system losses by 64 %. The soft switching approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of on/ off controlled systems and is particularly beneficial as switching frequencies are increased. The soft switching approach will also facilitate the use of slower on/off valves for effective on/off control; in simulation, a valve with soft switching matched the efficiency of an on/off valve that was 4. 4 times faster.

By combining these seismological clues with new field evidence and numerical magma flow modelling, we propose a seismic trigger model {{which is based on}} brittle failure of magma in the glass <b>transition.</b> <b>Loss</b> of heat and gas from the magma results in a strong viscosity gradient across a dyke or conduit. This leads to a buildup of shear stress near the conduit wall where magma can rupture in a brittle manner, as field evidence from a rhyolitic dyke demonstrates. This brittle failure provides seismic energy, the majority of which is trapped in the conduit or dyke forming the lowfrequency coda of the observed seismic signal. The trigger source location marks the transition from ductile conduit flow to friction-controlled magma ascent.
