5|$|There {{were also}} {{conflicts}} between the king and <b>the</b> <b>Scots,</b> whose church was ruled by a system of elected assemblies called presbyterianism. James, Charles's predecessor as King of Scotland, {{made it clear that}} he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the Book of Common Prayer on <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> beginning in 1604. <b>The</b> <b>Scots</b> considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English impositions on the Church of Scotland in 1636 and 1637. This led to the First Bishops' War between Charles and <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> in 1639. Charles called what came to be known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies. Following the Second Bishops' War with <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds.|$|E
5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority {{seems to have been}} limited to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1707 Acts of Union, many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were {{combined}} under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands for the War of the Spanish Succession. Although all the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment, they remained under the old operational-command structure and retained much of the institutional ethos, customs and traditions of the standing armies created shortly after the restoration of the monarchy 47 years earlier. The order of seniority of the most-senior British Army line regiments is based on that of the English army. Although technically <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> Royal Regiment of Foot was raised in 1633 and is the oldest Regiment of the Line, Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army on the date of their arrival in England (or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment). In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> Greys were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688, when <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> Greys eventually received the British Army rank of 2nd Dragoons.|$|E

5|$|Gloucester was {{involved}} in a brief skirmish with <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> on 23June, the day before the main battle. While the king considered whether to camp for the night or to engage <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> immediately, Gloucester and Hereford – either through insubordination or a misunderstanding – charged directly into the place called the New Park, where <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> were encamped. The English immediately ran into difficulties, and Hereford's cousin Henry de Bohun was killed by King Robert the Bruce. It was perhaps during the subsequent retreat that Gloucester was thrown off his horse, but managed to escape unharmed. The next day the English were still not entirely decided on the course of action. While Gloucester took the part of certain experienced captains, recommending that Edward avoid battle that day, the younger men surrounding the king labelled this lethargic and cowardly, and advised attack. According to the Vita Edwardi, when Edward grew angry and accused Gloucester of treason, the earl forcefully replied that he would prove his loyalty on the field of battle.|$|E

5|$|The main {{language}} of Strathclyde {{and elsewhere in}} the Hen Ogledd in the opening years of the High Middle Ages was Cumbric, a variety of the British language akin to Old Welsh. Some time after 1018 and before 1054, the kingdom appears to have been conquered by <b>the</b> <b>Scots,</b> most probably during the reign of Máel Coluim mac Cináeda who died in 1034. At this time the territory of Strathclyde extended as far south as the River Derwent. In 1054, the English king Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward of Northumbria against <b>the</b> <b>Scots,</b> then ruled by Mac Beth. By the 1070s, if not earlier in the reign of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada, it appears that <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> again controlled Strathclyde, although William Rufus annexed the southern portion in 1092. The territory was granted by Alexander I to his brother David, later King David I, in 1107.|$|E
50|$|The {{solar panels}} {{on the roof}} of <b>the</b> <b>Scot</b> Center are <b>the</b> largest at any college in the United States.

The college will lease the roof currently owned by Carbon Vision, and purchase all of the power generated for the next twelve and a half years. As of April 19, 2012 <b>the</b> <b>Scot</b> Center had generated 177,933.69 Kilowatt-hours in electricity. This is equal to 1,015 sixty-watt light bulbs being in use for one year of 8-hour days. In addition to the energy creating solar panels, <b>the</b> <b>Scot</b> Center is invested in energy saving technology for the inside of the facility as well.

5|$|The {{period between}} the {{accession}} of Máel Coluim I and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda was marked by {{good relations with the}} Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king Máel Coluim I received Strathclyde as part of a deal with King Edmund of England, an event offset somewhat by Máel Coluim's loss of control in Moray. Sometime in the reign of king Idulb (954–962), <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. Edinburgh. Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham (1018). <b>The</b> <b>Scots</b> had probably some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and {{it is not clear that}} <b>the</b> <b>Scots</b> were always strong enough to enforce their authority.|$|E
