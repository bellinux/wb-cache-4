5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{organizations}} documented a wide number {{of human rights}} violations and abuses committed by Soviet and Azerbaijani forces. These included forced deportations of civilians, unlawful killings, torture, kidnapping harassment, rape and the wanton seizure or destruction of property. Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E

This was by no means pleasing to the crew, who considered that they had small chance of falling in with anything of their own size on that station.

5|$|Immediately {{after that}} campaign, Simeon sought <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had {{attempted}} to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.|$|E
5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's first {{foreign policy}} crisis {{came with the}} 1979 Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan.

She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. The Financial Times reported that her government had secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment since 1981.|$|E

5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} of Greece, during the Persian Wars, began in 492 BC, {{and ended with}} the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king Darius I primarily in order <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> city-states of Athens and Eretria. These cities had supported the cities of Ionia during their revolt against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{then moved}} {{north along the}} Ionian coast towards Samos, before {{abruptly}} turning west into the Aegean Sea. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.|$|E

Reconciled with the emperor, he was granted, in c. 990, the title of kuropalates again in return for his promise that upon his death the lands previously placed under his sovereignty would revert to the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|Following his ousting, Peter the Venetian {{took refuge}} in Germany. In response, Samuel stormed Austria in 1042, {{provoking}} a retaliatory invasion by the German monarch, Henry III in 1043. It forced Samuel to renounce all Hungarian territories {{to the west of}} the rivers Leitha and Morava as well as agree to the payment of a tribute. The funding of the tribute payment was through new taxes on the Christian prelates and seizure of Church estates. This policy caused discontent even among the members of Samuel's own council. He had a number of his councillors executed during Lent. In order <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> king, Bishop Gerard of Csanád (modern-day Cenad, Romania) refused to perform the annual ceremony of putting the royal crown Gerard upon the monarch's head at Easter.|$|E
5|$|In 468, Leo chose Basiliscus {{as leader}} of the famous {{military}} expedition against Carthage. The invasion of the kingdom of the Vandals {{was one of the greatest}} military undertakings recorded in the annals of history, a combined amphibious operation with over ten thousand ships and one hundred thousand soldiers. The purpose of the operation was <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Vandal king Geiseric for the sacking of Rome in 455, in which the former capital of the Western Roman Empire was overwhelmed, and the Empress Licinia Eudoxia (widow of Emperor Valentinian III) and her daughters were taken as hostages.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad had preached the {{religion}} of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition {{from the rest of}} the Quraysh, the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. The Muslims fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as Yathrib; Medina means City). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to Damascus which the Muslims intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Muslims and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of the II Division, the US Navy {{destroyed}} the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. Diederichs detached Gefion to investigate the situation in Manila in an attempt to maneuver Germany into a position to secure colonial possessions in the Philippines, or even to obtain a German prince on the Philippine throne outright. In late March 1899, Gefion was sent to Kiaotschou in response to mistreatment of German missionaries there; Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Franz Grapow went ashore with a landing party of 132marines and artillerymen <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> offenders.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{remarkable}} events of Tamar's reign was {{the foundation of}} the Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in 1204. This state was established by Alexios I Megas Komnenos (r. 1204–1222) and his brother, David, in the northeastern Pontic provinces of the crumbling Byzantine Empire with the aid of Georgian troops. Alexios and David, Tamar's relatives, were fugitive Byzantine princes raised at the Georgian court. According to Tamar's historian, the aim of the Georgian expedition to Trebizond was <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine emperor Alexios IV Angelos (r. 1203–1204) for his confiscation of a shipment of money from the Georgian queen to the monasteries of Antioch and Mount Athos. However, Tamar's Pontic endeavor can better be explained by her desire {{to take advantage of the}} Western European Fourth Crusade against Constantinople to set up a friendly state in Georgia's immediate southwestern neighborhood, as well as by the dynastic solidarity to the dispossessed Komnenoi.|$|E
5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much {{that by the time}} it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which is still in the possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E

2500|$|.....the {{legislative}} {{judgment that}} interstate commerce {{must be protected}} from a continuing threat of such strikes is a permissible one in this case. The fact that the injury to interstate commerce would be an accomplished fact before any sanctions could be applied, {{the possibility that a}} large number of such strikes might be called at a time of external or internal crisis, and the practical difficulties which would be encountered in detecting illegal activities of this kind are factors which are persuasive that Congress should not be powerless to remove the threat, not limited <b>to</b> <b>punishing</b> <b>the</b> act.|$|R
50|$|This {{shift from}} an {{adversarial}} to a collaborative model represents {{an understanding of}} the need to minimize traditional legalistic processes, inherited from the civil litigation system. Human rights law is public law and is concerned not just with individual harms (like the civil tort system)but also the broader social context which contributes to the harm. The public interest in a human rights context also concerns itself with the way discriminatory harm impacts the greater social community. Canadian Human rights historically and currently is concerned with remediating private and public harm as opposed <b>to</b> <b>punishing</b> <b>the</b> respondent.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E
5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{had begun}} to alter his policy of {{indirect}} rule in Brittany and started to exert more direct control. In 1164 Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of Brittany and Normandy, and in 1166 invaded Brittany <b>to</b> <b>punish</b> <b>the</b> local barons. Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give Brittany to his daughter Constance; Constance was handed over and betrothed to Henry's son Geoffrey. This arrangement was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy. Elsewhere in France, Henry attempted to seize the Auvergne, much to the anger of the French king. Further south Henry continued to apply pressure on Raymond of Toulouse: the King campaigned there personally in 1161, sent the Archbishop of Bordeaux against Raymond in 1164 and encouraged Alfonso II of Aragon in his attacks. In 1165 Raymond divorced Louis's sister and attempted to ally himself with Henry instead.|$|E
