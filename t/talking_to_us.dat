500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in shows. If you're asking how it makes us feel? Pretty darn special... to know that you had that impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E

The idea was moonshine, I was informed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, Dmitry Medvedev said: [...] "The {{moment of}} truth for me, as I {{realized}} later while analyzing those events in hindsight over and over again, came with the visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice." [...] "Following that visit, my Georgian colleague simply dropped all communication with us. He simply stopped <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> he stopped writing letters and making phone calls. It was apparent that he had new plans now. And those plans were implemented later." [...] Medvedev {{also said that he}} decided to attack Georgia without consulting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, and that the two did not have a conversation until the following day.|$|E

60|$|Even {{in actual}} life egotism {{is not without}} its attractions. When people <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about others they are usually dull. When they <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about {{themselves}} they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them up when they become wearisome as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied they would be perfect absolutely.|$|R

2500|$|One protester, a Hampshire College {{student named}} Cora Segal, was {{recorded}} repeatedly shouting [...] "Keep your hate speech off this campus!" [...] and [...] "Fuck you!", and demanding [...] "Stop <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> like children!"; to this last demand, Hoff Sommers replied, [...] "Stop {{acting like a}} child and I will." [...] Before the event, the student had distributed flyers claiming that the panel {{was made up of}} people who [...] "don’t give a shit about people’s trauma and pain and think it’s funny to thrust people into states of panic and distress" [...] and who [...] "fundamentally do not understand what a trigger is, {{what it means to be}} triggered, and what a trigger warning is meant to prevent".|$|E
2500|$|The {{family did}} leave {{when he was}} five years old after Adams' uncle was killed in a mining accident. [...] "My father piled all our {{belongings}} into an old jalopy, with our bedding on top", Adams recalled. [...] "We didn't know where we were going. He started driving, and ran out of gas and money in Jersey City, New Jersey at Audubon Park. A man came over and started <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> a Mr. Cohn. He said to my father 'You look like you need a job,' and my father said 'I do'." [...] Adams' father was given a job as janitor of an apartment building along with living quarters in the basement. Eventually, they moved to Van Nostrand Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Rutgers Avenue. His mother worked for Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] {{knew that}} we were looking to do {{something}} a little different. As a company they'd just gone through some major infrastructure changes {{in the last few years}} and I think by <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different". In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me".|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{does not}} know you," [...] said the chaperone. [...] "You must not.... You have made a mistake. You must not go on <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> after that. You must not annoy us on the public ways." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which {{followed}} Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Israel, multiple Israeli heads of state have visited Egypt on numerous occasions. However, Sadat's successor, Hosni Mubarak, visited Israel only once—for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995—and never participated in talks on Israeli soil. In 2008, while on the Knesset speaker's podium during its memorial for Rehavam Ze'evi, Lieberman raised the issue and said, [...] "Mubarak never agreed to come here as president. He wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> Let him come here. He doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> He can go to hell." ...|$|R
60|$|At St. George's Church, Southwark, we {{were met}} by three gentlemen on horseback, who were merchants of my husband's acquaintance, and had come out on purpose, to go half a day's journey with us; and as they kept <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> at the coach side, we went a good pace, and were very merry together; we stopped at the best house of {{entertainment}} on Shooter's Hill.|$|E
6000|$|The {{staircase}} had a crimson carpet. Mr. Blunt {{appeared from}} somewhere in the hall. He was in riding breeches and a black coat with ample square skirts. This get-up suited him but it also changed him extremely by doing away with the effect of flexible slimness he produced in his evening clothes. He looked to me not at all himself but rather like a brother of the man who had been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> the night before. He carried about him a delicate perfume of scented soap. He gave us a flash of his white teeth and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, in the study, {{leaning against}} the mantelpiece in moody reflection, Mr Blatherwick was musing sadly on the hardships of the schoolmaster's life. The {{proprietor}} of Harrow House was a long, grave man, {{one of the last}} to hold out against the anti-whisker crusade. He had expressionless hazel eyes, and a general air of being present in body but absent in spirit. Mothers who visited the school to introduce their sons put his vagueness down to activity of mind. 'That busy brain,' they thought, 'is never at rest. Even while he is <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> some abstruse point in the classics is occupying his mind.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{glad to see}} you!" [...] she said. [...] "Can't {{you stay}} a little and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?</b> One {{is out of the}} breeze under the deck-house here. Harford, there are two unoccupied chairs yonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|And the {{multitude}} murmured {{against him and}} said to him, 'Thou hast led us into the desert, and hast given <b>us</b> no food <b>to</b> eat. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about God and it will suffice us.' ...|$|R
