As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 Elements of the Philosophy of Newton, where the chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own Essai sur l'optique.

This treatise, which is the oldest collection of halakot on mourning customs, was compiled in Palestine; and, according to Brüll (l.c.), R. Eleazar b. Zadok, who lived in Lydda {{at the time of}} Gamaliel II, prepared the nucleus of it. It was then amplified, enriched, and revised by R. Ḥiyya, but as it was known to a small circle only, it was replaced by the later treatise Ebel Rabbati, which borrowed much from it.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Anatolia, {{where the}} Pontic and Anti-Taurus {{mountain}} ranges converge, is rugged country with higher elevations, a more severe climate, and greater precipitation than are {{found on the}} Anatolian Plateau. The {{western part of the}} Eastern Anatolia Region is known as the Anti-Taurus, where the average elevation of mountain peaks exceed 3,000 meters; while {{the eastern part of the}} region was historically known as the Armenian Highland and includes Mount Ararat, the highest point in Turkey at 5,137 meters. Many of the East Anatolian peaks apparently are recently extinct volcanoes, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>from</b> extensive green lava flows. Turkey's largest lake, Lake Van, is situated in the mountains at an elevation of 1,546 meters. The headwaters of three major rivers arise in the Anti-Taurus: the east-flowing Aras, which pours into the Caspian Sea; the south-flowing Euphrates; and the south-flowing Tigris, which eventually joins the Euphrates in Iraq before emptying into the Persian Gulf. Several small streams that empty into the Black Sea or landlocked Lake Van also originate in these mountains.|$|E

500|$|After Claudius annexed Mauretania in 44AD, {{the city}} grew {{substantially}} {{due to its}} wealth and prosperity, derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain, olive oil and wild animals for gladiatorial spectacles.

It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer Pomponius Mela, who described it in his work De situ orbis libri III as one of [...] "the wealthiest cities, albeit the wealthiest among small ones" [...] in Mauretania. It is also mentioned by Pliny the Elder, and the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary refers to its location and names it as Volubilis Colonia. Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers.|$|E
500|$|In his own will, Alfred {{left the}} bulk of his {{property}} to Edward, while Æthelhelm was left eight estates, and Æthelwold only three (at Godalming and Guildford in Surrey, and Steyning in Sussex), all in the less important eastern part of the kingdom. The largest of these was Steyning, Æthelwulf's original burial place; in Patrick Wormald's view, Alfred may have moved the body to Winchester because he was required to give the estate to Æthelwold under his agreement with Æthelred, and he did not want his nephew to have the prestige of owning his grandfather's grave. Keynes and Lapidge comment: [...] "If only <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>from</b> the relatively small number of estates he received, Æthelwold in particular would have had cause to be aggrieved by this allocation of property, and his resentment is shown by his rebellion against Edward soon after Alfred's death."

2500|$|The {{official}} {{offer of}} divine honours {{to the living}} princeps weighed his god-like powers against his self-restraint and pious respect for Republican tradition. [...] "Good" [...] emperors rejected the offer with every appearance of gratitude and humility, accepting the more modest offer of genius cult as an honour to the donor and the imperial office. Claims that later emperors sought and obtained divine honours in Rome reflect their bad relationship with their senates: in Tertullian's day, it was still [...] "a curse to name the emperor a god [...] before his death".

2500|$|The use of Latin as a liturgical {{language}} {{seems to}} have occurred first in the Roman province of Africa, corresponding approximately to present-day Tunisia, where knowledge of Greek was not as widespread as in Rome.

Latin may have been used in the liturgy for some groups in Rome earlier than that, just as, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>from</b> a quotation in Greek from a Roman oratio oblationis of 360, other groups will have continued to use Greek even later in that cosmopolitan city.|$|E

2500|$|The Amphiareion of Oropos (...) , {{situated}} in the hills 6km southeast of the fortified port of Oropos, was a sanctuary dedicated in the late 5th century BCE to the hero Amphiaraos, where pilgrims went to seek oracular responses and healing.
