5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|During their play-date, Bart {{notices that}} Ralph's father has a police master key capable of opening any door in Springfield. Bart and Ralph thus steal {{the key and}} decide to enter several closed stores at night. After encountering Nelson and his gang, the boys go to a {{condemned}} penitentiary. When Ralph objects because he is afraid, the bullies leave, but not before <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> key into the penitentiary. Ralph and Bart enter the prison to retrieve the key, {{and in the process}} stumble onto a room housing an old electric chair. After testing out the chair, the two flee when an elderly guard approaches.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} that Matt Hardy was not medically cleared to compete (due to an injury suffered on a previous episode of SmackDown), and a match {{was announced}} with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) defending his WWE United States Championship against the fans' choice between Kane, The Great Khali, and Mark Henry. The second match was for the ECW Championship between CM Punk and The Miz, {{the winner of the}} voting. The match was back and forth {{for the first half of}} the match. The Miz gained the advantage after forcing Punk to fall from the second rope. Punk came back after hip <b>tossing</b> <b>The</b> Miz from the top rope. Punk won the match after a GTS.|$|E

50|$|A furigoma 振り駒 'piece toss' is used {{to decide}} who moves first. One of <b>the</b> players <b>tosses</b> five pawns. If the number of tokins (promoted pawns, と) facing up is higher than unpromoted pawns (歩), then <b>the</b> player who <b>tossed</b> <b>the</b> pawns plays gote 後手 'white' (that is, they have the second move). Among amateur tournaments, the higher-ranked player or {{defending}} champion also performs <b>the</b> piece <b>toss.</b> In professional games, the furigoma is done on the behalf of the higher-ranked player/champion by the timekeeper who kneels {{by the side of}} the higher-ranked player and <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> pawn pieces onto a silk cloth. In friendly amateur games, a player will ask their opponent to <b>toss</b> <b>the</b> pawns out of politeness. Otherwise, <b>the</b> person who <b>tosses</b> <b>the</b> pawns can be determined by Rock-paper-scissors.|$|R
5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a restructuring of its franchising system, <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 restructuring, led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the shoulders of the company.|$|E
5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|The two {{previous}} years' American League Cy Young Award winners started the game: CC Sabathia, for the Yankees; and Lee, for the Phillies. Sabathia, {{who had been}} 3–0 in the postseason to date, pitched seven innings and allowed two earned runs on four hits; Lee, however, pitched a complete game and allowed no earned runs to go the distance {{for the second time}} during the 2009 postseason. The Phillies offense was paced by Utley, who walked in the first inning to set a record of 26 consecutive postseason games reaching base, and hit solo home runs in the third and sixth innings. Philadelphia led 2–0 until the eighth inning, when an Ibáñez single scored Rollins and Victorino, and added two more runs {{in the top of the}} ninth inning on a Victorino single and a Howard double. The Phillies allowed an unearned run in the bottom of the ninth when Rollins committed a throwing error, <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> ball past Howard at first base and into the Yankee dugout.|$|E

However, it is Halachically permitted in the Diaspora to give the separated Challah to a Kohen for consumption, and even encouraged by some Rabbinic authorities, with the provision that the Kohen has immersed in a Mikvah.

25|$|In Missouri in 1993, 17-year-old Christopher Simmons, {{along with}} two younger friends, Charles Benjamin and John Tessmer, concocted a plan to murder Shirley Crook. The plan was to commit {{burglary}} and murder by breaking and entering, tying up a victim, and <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> victim off a bridge. The three met {{in the middle of}} the night; however, Tessmer dropped out of the plot. Simmons and Benjamin broke into Mrs. Crook's home, bound her hands and covered her eyes.

25|$|The {{researchers}} found {{the results of}} this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the same event.|$|E

Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> coin. The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.|$|E

25|$|While {{large scale}} {{reclamation}} {{began in the}} 1850s, the earliest reclamations in Wellington were conducted by private citizens. A popular story of the first reclamation conducted in Wellington was that done by George Bennet. Bennet had arrived in 1848 on the Berenicia and purchased a hilly section at Windy, or Clay Point (what is now the corner of Lambton Quay and Willis Street). At that time, Windy Point was a precipice with a narrow and often impassible path connecting Willis Street to Beach Road (now Lambton Quay). Bennet commenced, to the amusement of neighbours, with pick-axe, shovel and barrow to move earth from the Point, <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> spoil onto the path and into the harbour, thus widened the track and performing Wellington's first reclamation.|$|E

That year he achieved his personal best throw in the shot, <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> metal ball a distance of 20.83m – a Canadian record. Between 1976 and 1983, only he and Pauletto won the honour, with the pair dominating the Canadian national scene.|$|E

She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then performs a sex act on the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then <b>tossing</b> <b>the</b> wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole {{at the base of the}} dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.|$|E
