40|$|This paper studied <b>the</b> {{effects of}} <b>anti-dumping</b> {{measures}} on <b>the</b> imports {{to investigate whether}} the trade restriction effect of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is dominant. Our results indicate that a 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> decreases <b>the</b> import of the targeted product by about 0. 43 ~ 0. 51 %. The actual statistics, however, show that the total import of the targeted products increased by about 30 percent while an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was in force. That indicates that an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> is just a temporary import relief.

The hazards model estimates show that increase in market share, MFN tariff rate, and dumping margin decrease the hazard of termination of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> but <b>the</b> increase in value added increases the hazard of termination. Generally speaking, this result indicates that the WTO member countries have regulated the overuse of an <b>anti-dumping</b> measure. <b>The</b> findings of this paper show that there is a country- and industry-wise heterogeneous characteristic in the effect as well as termination of an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty...</b>|$|R

40|$|On the 26 th of November 2013 the European Commission {{concluded}} that solar glass origi- nating from the People’s Republic of China had been {{dumped into the}} European market. The Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on subsequent imports. This thesis eval- uates the expected and actual welfare implications for consumers in the German market after <b>the</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was introduced. As Europe’s largest solar energy producer, German data on solar energy production, sampled between 2011 and 2014, as well as price levels and installation rates for solar energy provides a robust framework of analysis. By way of a mul- tiple regression analysis, {{it is found that}} the introduction of the Commission’s anti-dumping duty had a statistically insignificant effect on the production of solar electricity in the German market. Through the continued growth in solar energy production, it is found that German consumers are inelastic to changes in the price of solar energy. Prior literature underlines the prevalence of consumption preferences for consumers who exhibit the ’warm-glow’ effect and derive utility out of altruism towards the environment. The heightened consumption of solar energy in spite of rising prices underlines this effect. These conclusions enable further consider- ation for the duty’s implications for market welfare in the country, and also its implications for the wider European community. It is concluded, in contrast with classical theory on industrial organisation, that European consumers were made no worse off as a result of <b>the</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> and that producers benefited...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how European anti-dumping policy under {{imperfect competition}} affects firm behaviour and domestic welfare. Our theoretical {{model is the}} first to complement the European empirical literature on anti-dumping policy (see Messerlin (1989), Hindley (1988), Tharakan and Waelbroeck (1994)), and can usefully be compared with recent papers dealing with the effects of US anti-dumping policy (Reitzes (1993), Fischer (1992), Prusa (1994)). We use a two-period Cournot duopoly model with a European and a foreign firm that differ in costs and products. European anti-dumping policy differs from its US counterpart mainly in terms of injury margin calculation and the derivation of <b>the</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty.</b> European anti-dumping rules provide the home firm with incentives to either induce or to feign injury. Our results indicate that when the level of protection is endogenous, the strategic trade policy argument for protection need not apply. Our findings also suggest that US anti-dumping rules perform better than European rules in terms of welfare and in terms of protecting domestic value added and employment.

Using data on Vietnamese households, the authors study the responses of catfish producers in the Mekong delta of Vietnam between 2002 and 2004. The evidence suggests that the rate of growth of income of households that depended on catfish sales was significantly affected. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> triggered significant exit from catfish farming. Households adjusted by moving out of catfish aquaculture and into wage labor markets and agriculture, but not into other aquaculture activities.

50|$|According to the {{findings}} of the investigations set by the European Union, Argentine and Indonesian companies benefit from an unfair advantage because of the access they have to raw materials at prices that are low compared to the world market prices available to the EU producers of biodiesel. This is because of the high export taxes that the Argentine and Indonesian government imposes on raw materials used in the biodiesel production. The investigation found that the dumping margin of Argentina was around 41.9% and 49.2%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 23.3%.

40|$|<b>Anti-dumping</b> <b>duties,</b> {{safeguards}} and countervailing duties are collectively, {{within the}} context of the WTO, referred to as „trade remedies. ‟ More specifically, <b>the</b> imposition of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> is a remedial measure for dealing with imports that cause or threatens to cause injury to local producers. Under the WTO framework, Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on the Implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 provides the rules for applying <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> by member countries.

40|$|The Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) (Anti-Dumping Agreement) {{permits the}} {{imposition}} of anti-dumping duties for as long {{and to the extent}} necessary to counteract dumping which is causing injury, subject to the proviso that they must be terminated after five years unless a sunset review has been initiated. A sunset review has the purpose of either permitting or terminating the continuation of an anti-dumping duty. This is significant because if the sunset review is not initiated prior to the expiry of the five-year period, the anti-dumping duties will be terminated. Therefore, this places an emphasis on the determination of the precise date of commencement of the anti-dumping duties. This is because an incorrect determination of the date of {{the imposition of}} <b>the</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> has obvious financial implications for the interested parties. The Supreme Court of Appeal in South Africa has delivered two salient judgments in this regard: firstly, in Progress Office Machines CC v SARS 2008 2 SA 13 (SCA) (POM), and then more recently, in Association of Meat Importers v ITAC 2013 4 All SA 253 (SCA) (AMIE). This paper contends that these two judgments are in conflict and are riddled with inconsistencies. Secondly, the paper contends that the SCA has in the recent AMIE case virtually rewritten its earlier judgment of Progress Office Machines. Lastly, the paper shows that the approach of South African courts to whether the Anti-Dumping Agreement is binding on South African law is fraught with uncertainty and ambivalence.

40|$|Since price {{discrimination}} and selling below cost {{arise in the}} normal course of business and are usually legal for domestic firms, countering these practices by foreign firms provides a very weak rationale for antidumping duties. If antidumping duties were to provide a systematic defense against predation by foreign firms, however, a strong “fair-trade ” justification would remain. This paper adapts the classic entry-deterrence analysis of Dixit (1979) and Brander and Spencer (1981) to provide a simple treatment of predation, which is applicable with price leadership as well as quantity leadership. Although situations of cross-border predation appear to be quite rare, foreign firms may sometimes find themselves in leadership positions if they have to make shipments and/or set prices before their domestic rivals. This paper shows that, in the context of such an international leadership game, predation may occur without dumping and visa versa. Further, when dumping and predation do coexist, a sophisticated form of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> would prevent predation, but <b>the</b> simple <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> that are generally observed in practice will often be insufficient. Consequently, the paper challenges the “fair-trade ” view of antidumping policy as an antidote for predation and strengthens the foundation of the counter-argument that antidumping constitutes a new insidious form of protectionism and trade harassment, which is of particularly serious concerns for small countries...|$|R
