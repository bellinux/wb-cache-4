25|$|After {{the death}} of her father in 1969, Rosemary was {{occasionally}} taken to visit relatives in Florida and Washington, D.C., and to her childhood home on Cape Cod. By that time, Rosemary had learned to walk again but did so with a limp. She never regained the ability to speak clearly and her arm was palsied. Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for Eunice Kennedy Shriver to later found the Special Olympics, although Shriver told The New York Times in 1995 <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> exactly the case. In 1983, the Kennedy family gave $1 million to renovate Alverno House. The gift added a therapeutic pool and enlarged the chapel.|$|E
25|$|FitzGerald (1889) offered another {{explanation}} of the negative result of the Michelson–Morley experiment. Contrary to Voigt, he speculated that the intermolecular forces are possibly of electrical origin so that material bodies would contract {{in the line of}} motion (length contraction). This was in connection with the work of Heaviside (1887), who determined that the electrostatic fields in motion were deformed (Heaviside Ellipsoid), which leads to physically undetermined conditions at the speed of light. However, FitzGerald's idea remained widely unknown and was not discussed before Oliver Lodge published a summary of the idea in 1892. Also Lorentz (1892b) proposed length contraction independently from FitzGerald in order to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment. For plausibility reasons, Lorentz referred to the analogy of the contraction of electrostatic fields. However, even Lorentz admitted <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a necessary reason and length-contraction consequently remained an ad hoc hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Although for the reactor's backup {{systems were}} available, the power loss proved <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{the case for}} the spent fuel pools. No {{measures}} had been taken to prevent small animals entering this important equipment located at {{the back of a truck}} in open air. On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject. Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence in the safety of the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.|$|E

In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of what we were going to do once the military campaign was over.

2500|$|The album drew a mixed {{critical}} reaction, {{with many}} reviewers commenting favorably on it but criticizing its traditional rock sound. The staff of Ultimate Guitar enjoyed the album, rating it 7 stars out of 10, but declared that it [...] "seems to be {{frozen in the}} '70s", criticizing Heppner's singing and the overt influences from bands such as AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Motörhead (even though Heppner has stated {{he is not a}} Motörhead fan), but otherwise praising the group for the song [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] and the cowbell on [...] "Run Home". Tom Breihan wrote for Pitchfork Media that Hello Master was largely derivative of some of the aforementioned acts plus Ted Nugent, but noted <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> necessarily a bad thing; Breihan mainly disliked [...] "Living Like a Dog" [...] but praised [...] "Talk to Her" [...] and [...] "Time Will Cut You Down", the latter in particular for its chorus, and gave the record 7.3 points out of 10. Prefix writer Zach Hothorn, giving the album a 6.0 out of 10, considered [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] as [...] "a nice reprieve from the incessant open-A Angus Young riffing", and criticized [...] "Blood" [...] as [...] "sound like an afterthought" [...] and compared it to Queens of the Stone Age. Rating the album 3.0 out of 5 and suggesting that the band were having a crisis of musical identity on the record, as the album art seemed indicative of a different style of music than was present on the album, Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Irving Tan wrote that {{the second half of the}} album strove too diligently to mimic Metallica, Black Sabbath and Budgie, except for closing track [...] "Blood" [...] (which he said was the album's [...] "most intriguing" [...] song and evidence of the band's true potential). IGN's Chad Grishow gave a mixed review of 6.6 out of 10 and explained that [...] "Two Kids" [...] (mistakenly identifying Heppner as singing lead vocals on that song) and [...] "Blood" [...] (which he said sounded like a [...] "completely different band" [...] and would have been most fitting as a B-side) were the best tracks on the album, but that Priestess were inferior to like-minded [...] "retro sound" [...] contemporaries Wolfmother.|$|E
