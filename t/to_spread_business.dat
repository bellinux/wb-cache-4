The analysis shows that in the entire analyzed period Republic of Croatia together with state funds and other public institutions was the main issuer of securities that banks have in their portfolios. The securities issued by banks and companies represent only a marginal part of banks’ portfolios {{but it is also}} true that banks have strongly supported the privatization process of state owned companies by providing credit for purchasing of shares and later on swapping their credit claims for shares. In this way banks acquired a significant portfolio of shares that they later sold on the open market. Data about the significant reduction of securities portfolio in the banking assets structure, from 46. 1 % in 1993 to only 10. 6 % in 2004, is indicative of a low level of trading in securities. This means that in the following years, central and local government should secure the necessary funds more by issuing securities than by credit, especially not by taking credit from abroad. Furthermore, in order <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>business</b> with securities, banks should also substitute a portion of their credit portfolio with short and long term securities. In this way, the investors would be able to use the benefits of investing in securities instead of investing their funds in bank deposits as they have done until now...|$|E

In this research the main case that the researcher focusing for is creating the successful corporate identity of Mt. Kinabalu International Climbathon Event. The summarize of each chapter can be found to the next paragraphs. Chapter one briefly described about the problem statement of the research. The problem of the research is corporate identity items is not represent the company vision and objective, in other word inconsistence corporate identity. The inconsistence of the corporate identity make audience confuse about the image of the company. In addition, many companies never noticed the importance of the corporate identity. The key of chapter two is the research objectives which; to improve people’s knowledge about the corporate identity of Mt. Kinabalu International Climbathon event; to create awareness about the importance of creating the successful corporate identity of Mt. Kinabalu international Event.

Half {{of the total population}} is represented by Women but in industry and other entrepreneurial activities, they are in few numbers. After analyzing the data it was found that most of the women entered into the entrepreneurship around the age of 39 and above. This gives an impression that women entrepreneurs by the age of thirties become independent of their family responsibilities and left with no work. Almost every woman opted for the business related to beauty-parlour and law. Educational background of the women entrepreneurs also seems to be quite impressive, as most of them have completed their studies up to graduation. Most of them have found to be doing household works before starting their business. They were not doing any other service or private jobs. This could be due to their responsibilities of household works and issues of raising children. The type of business which most of them are running is of shop. This can be mainly due to the reason as before entering into business they were indulged in their household works. Most of them sell their products on the regional level. This shows that they are gradually stepping forward and try <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> their <b>business</b> so that it can flourish. The reason which majority of them has given to start a business was social factors. They need encouragement and support from their families, social circles and most importantly the government.

Enterprises can imitate and improve mature products in the market and thereby realize an imitation innovation effect with the help of market information. In areas where domestic trade is more active, market information and market demand can <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>businesses</b> easier and quicker due to faster economic cycles, and thus act on imitation innovation (Sjöholm, 1996). In addition, innovative products can be tested by the market in a timely manner, which is conducive to making adjustments or carrying out secondary innovation according to market feedback. In this process, foreign trade plays the role of information sources. Contrastingly, in areas where foreign trade is developed, the overseas qualified product information, as well as technical information, can flow in a timely manner to the local enterprises. Thus, local enterprises can learn from foreign technology or products and implement a reverse crack on them, through which innovation costs can be reduced and innovation efficiency can be improved.|$|R

To accommodate these people in the actual cities will be a challenge and the governors have to work on it. There are a lot of different ways to investigate how people is interacting with the city to make it better but one of them is the recognizability map that everyone have on their mind of the city. This will be very important in the future, how much they know their city and what things can relate with the places. For example, it could be interesting for an administrator of a city to know which areas need to increase their visibility or for a manager that wants to know which are the well­known streets or places of a city <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> his <b>business.</b> The web page Urban Opticon runs a game which permits to know through a crowdsourced gamification web application, the well­known points of London.

40|$|Introduction: The {{business}} logic of corporations working with environmental management has traditionally focused on corporate in-house aspects of environmental issues. Some corporations are extending this focus towards {{all stages of}} a product life cycle, referred to as environmental life cycle management (LCM) (Hunkeler et al., 2003; Baumann and Tillman, 2004; Poikkimäki, 2006). But research describing LCM integration is rare (Seuring, 2004; Vermeulen and Seuring, 2009) and often fails to describe difficulties of organizing LCM in practice (Nilsson-Lindén et al., 2014). In this paper, we explore the processes of integrating LCM into an organization, using a model of translation (Czarniawska and Sevón, 1996). The traditional diffusion theory of innovation imply that an idea diffuses through an organization with the help only of the attractiveness of the idea itself. This is not reflected in our study, instead {{we have seen a}} process of change, where change {{is a result of the}} actions of many. Thereby, it is useful to apply the translation model, as another theory for the study of innovation, in order to gain improved understanding of LCM practice. Methods: Using interviews, observations and documents, we studied how the idea of life cycle thinking (LCT) traveled in a multinational manufacturing corporation, and how it was translated into practice in two settings: the sustainability and the purchasing departments. Results: An idea of LCT was picked up when a development unit started using life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate environmental burden along product life cycles. LCT then got picked up at the Sustainability Department and translated into LCM as new concepts, policies, and practices developed, e. g. the development of a green business portfolio. Here, LCT influenced environmental management from being corporate-oriented to product chain oriented (LCM). Members of the Sustainability Department enacted these ideas and practices with the ambition <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> the idea of LCM into the different departments. At the Purchasing Department, another translation process instead took place, picking up sustainability with LCT elements from standards and regulation. Here, the translation process put focus on the upstream supply chain—the context in which purchasing operates. Discussion and Conclusion: LCM became the ambition of the organization, but the translation processes in different departments were not in sync. We found different varieties of the life cycle idea, picked up from different sources. The ambition was <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> a <b>business</b> idea of LCM in the organization, but in the Purchasing Department only upstream sustainability management was in focus, thus differentiating from LCM with business discussions based in the full product chain. Drawing on translation theory, we suggest that practitioners need to go beyond LCM implementation and diffusion, to engage actively in understanding interpretations and translations of LCM elsewhere in the organization. Cross-departmental collaboration is one way to enhance practitioners understanding for how sustainability-related issues provides opportunities or challenges for different parts of the organization and thus a way to strengthen LCM uptake in the organization...|$|R
