5|$|An {{example of}} the {{importance}} of iron's symbolic role may be found in the German Campaign of 1813. Frederick William III commissioned <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Iron Cross as military decoration. Berlin iron jewellery reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription Gold gab ich für Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga argued that, {{although}} the first premise is not rationally established, {{it is not}} contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting {{that the existence of}} anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.|$|E

5|$|Sir Thomas Hungerford {{bought the}} {{property}} from the Bunghersh family in 1369 for £733. By 1385 the manor {{was known as}} Farley Hungerford, after its new owner. Sir Thomas Hungerford was a knight and courtier, who became rich as the Chief Steward to the powerful John of Gaunt and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> recorded Speaker of the House of Commons. Thomas decided to make Farleigh Hungerford his principal home and, between 1377 and 1383, built a castle on the site; unfortunately he did not acquire the appropriate licence to crenellate from the king before commencing building, and Thomas had to acquire a royal pardon in 1383.|$|E
5|$|The axiom of {{foundation}} {{proposed that}} every set {{can be constructed}} {{from the bottom up}} in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became an essential instrument in set theory.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as manager of}} Burton Albion in October 1962 after impressing the chairman with {{his knowledge of the}} game. He built a strong team and led the club to victory in the Southern League Cup in 1964. In 1965, Clough appointed him as his assistant at Hartlepools United, and Taylor helped Clough to rebuild the playing squad. The pair moved on to Derby County in May 1967, taking the club to the Second Division title in 1968–69, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Division title in 1971–72, and the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1973. The duo resigned in October 1973 after their strained relationship with the club's board of directors became unworkable. Clough and Taylor moved on to Brighton & Hove Albion in November 1973, and Taylor stayed on as manager after Clough left Brighton in July 1974.|$|E

5|$|On the May 7, 1995 (taped April 26, 1995) {{episode of}} WWF Action Zone, Holly pinned WWF Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett in a title match, but as Jarrett had {{his foot on}} the ropes, the {{decision}} was overturned and the title vacated. Later on in the show, Jarrett defeated Holly in a rematch for the vacant title after pinning Holly with a roll-up. Holly's title win is not recognized by WWE. Holly then competed in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament, defeating Mantaur to qualify before losing to The Roadie in the quarterfinals. He was <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> WWF pay-per-view opponent of Hunter Hearst Helmsley, losing to him at SummerSlam. At Survivor Series, Holly {{was a part of the}} Underdogs team along with Marty Jannetty, Hakushi and Barry Horowitz.

5|$|There {{are three}} PvP modes in Vainglory: Standard, {{in which the}} whole map is available, Battle Royale, in which {{progression}} is faster and the battle is limited only to the lane, and Blitz, in which players must gain the most number of points or reach the 15 point score cap in 5 minutes by taking down turrets and killing off Crystal Sentries or the Gold Miner which gives three points each, or by killing other players which gives one point. If a Blitz match were to ever be tied by the 5 minute mark, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team to score the first point in overtime wins. Players can play ranked Standard games to increase their in-game ranking, or casual Standard games, in which their rank is not affected. In the game client, ranked play duration is listed as 25 minutes, whereas casual play is 20 minutes.|$|E

5|$|I-215 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} {{at the mouth}} of Parley's Canyon in Millcreek near the southeast corner of Salt Lake City that connects I-80, Foothill Drive (State Route 186, or SR-186) and Parleys Way. At this point, I-215 splits into three legs, connecting I-80 toward Salt Lake City, Foothill Drive and Parleys Way, and I-80 through Parley's Canyon. From here, the freeway travels southeast along the Salt Lake Valley's east bench with three lanes in each direction. The route enters a residential area of East Millcreek and turns south. <b>Then,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> exit appears, an incomplete diamond interchange with 3300 South (SR-171) that lacks an off-ramp from northbound I-215. Past this interchange, an on-ramp connects 3800South to northbound I-215. A block further south is a partial interchange lacking an off-ramp from northbound I-215 onto 3900South. Entering Holladay, I-215 is heading south but soon turns southwest. An off-ramp here allows northbound motorists to connect to Wasatch Boulevard. However, this exit is signed as 3900South and 3300South because of the incomplete interchanges on both roads. Past an interchange at 4500 South (SR-266) that serves southbound I-215, the road turns south again and begins descending toward Knudsen's Corner and Cottonwood Heights. At this point, the southbound lanes are lower than the parallel northbound lanes. The belt route flattens out upon reaching an interchange at 6200 South at Knudsen's Corner.|$|E
