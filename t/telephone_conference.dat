50|$|Belevitch {{introduced}} the mathematical concept of conference matrices in 1950, so called because they originally arose {{in connection with}} a problem Belevitch was working on concerning <b>telephone</b> <b>conferencing.</b> However, they have applications in a range of other fields as well as being of interest to pure mathematics.

Ideal signal loss means the loss is only that due to splitting the signal between conference subscribers - there is no dissipation within the conference network.|$|R
