5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> handle as a reminder of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. <b>The</b> <b>flap</b> is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E
40|$|An {{exhaust nozzle}} for a {{gas turbine engine}} {{comprises}} a number of arcuate flaps pivotally connected to {{the trailing edge of}} a cylindrical casing which houses the engine. Seals disposed within <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> are spring biased and extensible beyond the side edges of <b>the</b> <b>flaps.</b> <b>The</b> seals of adjacent flaps are maintained in sealing engagement with each other when <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> are adjusted between positions defining minimum nozzle flow area and the cruise position. Extensible, spring biased seals are also disposed within <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> adjacent to a supporting pylon to thereby engage the pylon in a sealing arrangement. <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> are hinged to the casing at the central portion of the flaps' leading edges and are connected to actuators at opposed outer portions of the leading edges to thereby maximize the mechanical advantage in the actuation of <b>the</b> <b>flaps...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{featured a}} unique [...] "safe-trim" [...] system. This mechanical device links <b>the</b> wing <b>flaps</b> to <b>the</b> tail trim system and automatically adjusts the horizontal stabilizer angle when <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> are deflected, reducing or eliminating pitch changes when <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> are lowered.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was predominantly made from aluminium, with some stainless steel {{used for the}} wing ribs, controls and fittings. The two-place side-by-side cockpit was made from fibreglass. Its four-piece 60.75 ft span high aspect ratio wing employed a modified Wortmann FX-61-163/35SF airfoil. <b>The</b> Fowler <b>flaps</b> occupied <b>the</b> entire trailing edge of the wing and accounted for 35% of the wing chord. In cruise <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were retracted, reducing the wing area. While climbing, <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were extended, producing a high lift coefficient of 2.2. For glidepath control when landing <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> deployed to 80° to create aerodynamic drag. <b>The</b> outer <b>flaps</b> acted as slotted ailerons for roll control.|$|R
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> shrouds, elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E
2500|$|The DC-8 was {{following}} a Cessna 177 Cardinal, designated 67T, {{which was also}} conducting a back-course approach, flying at [...] All communication between SK933, 67T and air traffic control was occurring on the same frequency. Air-traffic control asked SK933 at 19:19:35 to reduce its speed further to take the Cessna into account, and the pilots reduced their speed to [...] This speed requires the full extension of <b>the</b> <b>flaps,</b> but this step was not carried out. The nose gear was showing an unsafe indication; should <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> be extended fully without the nose gear down, a horn would blow, {{which could not be}} silenced without retracting <b>the</b> <b>flaps.</b> <b>The</b> captain recycled the gear, but the indicator light still showed an unsafe condition. Meanwhile, the first officer believed that <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were fully extended, and started reducing speed to [...] After the flight engineer confirmed that the nose gear was down and locked, the captain fully extended <b>the</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a rhinoplastic reconstruction of the external nose derives from {{the contents of the}} surgeon's armamentarium of skin-flap techniques applicable to correcting defects of the nasal skin and of the mucosal lining; some management techniques are <b>the</b> Bilobed <b>flap,</b> <b>the</b> Nasolabial <b>flap,</b> <b>the</b> Paramedian forehead <b>flap,</b> and <b>the</b> Septal mucosal <b>flap.</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on flow {{visualization}} {{experiment and}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement, the shedding vortex of flapping wing model with single {{degree of freedom}} was studied experimentally and several conclusions were obtained as follow. (1) A horn-shape shedding vortex with a wingspan-direction movement is generated around the leading edge {{as well as the}} trailing edge during <b>flapping.</b> (2) <b>The</b> shedding vortex leads to alternative pressure differences with unequal scalar on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>flapping</b> wing. (3) Both attack angle and inflow speed are not zero, which are essential factors to the lift generation of study object. (4) The maximum circulation of the shedding vortex appears at about 3 / 5 of <b>the</b> upward <b>flapping</b> journey, as well as <b>the</b> downward <b>flapping</b> journey. (5) <b>The</b> circulation of the shedding vortex is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>flapping</b> speed. (6) <b>The</b> <b>flapping</b> wing generates more work during <b>the</b> downward <b>flapping</b> journey, as compared with <b>the</b> upward <b>flapping</b> journey, resulting in the generation of lift within a whole flapping cycle...|$|R
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E
25|$|A rather long pedicle {{located at}} the edge of <b>the</b> <b>flap,</b> making <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> very {{versatile}} in its positioning possibilities. Flap harvest is possible with patient in the prone position. Relatively easy flap dissection. Generally there is a good internal projection of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> without the need for folding or tucking.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these spanwise vortices shed behind <b>the</b> <b>flap,</b> chordwise vortices shed from in front of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> become important at high angles of attack.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{wing flaps}} {{are used to}} improve low speed flying {{characteristics}} and reduce landing and take-off speeds. <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> are hydraulically operated. Interconnecting cables synchronize <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> throughout their range of travel and a limit switch located on <b>the</b> left <b>flap</b> sector prevents over-travel. An audible waning horn warns of flap extension to more than 25 degrees if the landing gear is not down and locked.|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} rate and elastic {{properties of the}} anterior abdominal skin flap in Sprague-Dawley rats were studied in three groups of animals. In group 1 where <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were supplied by a normal artery, arterial flaps (1 A) had better {{survival rate}} and elastic properties than venous flaps (1 B). In group 2, where <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were supplied by an artery with diminished perfusion pressure, <b>the</b> arterial <b>flaps</b> (2 A) still had slightly better results than venous flaps (2 B). However, in group 3 where <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> were supplied by a vein, venous flaps (3 B) had better results than arterial flaps (3 A). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Using an elevator, <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> is {{dissected}} in a sub-mucoperichondrial plane. The (far) {{distal edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> is {{cut with a}} right-angle Beaver blade, and then is transposed into the wound. The exposed cartilages will reepithelialise (regenerate the epithelium), provided the opposite (contralateral) side of the septal mucosa is undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|Some post-LASIK {{patients}} see halos and starbursts around {{bright lights}} at night. At night, the pupil may dilate {{to be larger}} than <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> leading {{to the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> or stromal changes causing visual distortion of light that does not occur during the day when the pupil is smaller. The eyes can be examined for large pupils pre-operatively and the risk of this symptom assessed.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of swirl flaps are mainly associated with fouling by exhaust gas recirculation, which leaves tarry deposits on <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> and <b>the</b> {{inside of the}} intake manifold. Over time <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> can begin to stick in one position and the engine management system may report an error code if <b>the</b> correct <b>flap</b> position cannot be achieved within a few percent of the design specification. More seriously, <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> or their mountings can fracture under the strain and parts can enter the cylinder. This almost always causes major engine damage due to the very small clearances inside a diesel engine. The BMW M47TU 2-litre engine manufactured between 2001 and 2004, and the similar 3-litre engine, is notorious for swirl <b>flap</b> failure, as <b>the</b> small screws used to secure <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> to their spindle will fall into the intake ports if the spindle fractures; in 2004 the intake manifold was redesigned to eliminate these. Some owners choose to have <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> removed as a precaution, with blanking plates fitted to maintain manifold sealing. In many cases the impact on driveability and fuel economy is negligible.|$|R

50|$|The GW-7 is of all metal construction, has a 15 m {{wing span}} and employs a NASA NLF(1)-0215F airfoil. <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> and ailerons are interconnected. <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> travel +/-10° in normal flight {{in concert with}} the ailerons and then can be {{deployed}} to 60° for glidepath control on landing.|$|R
25|$|The first {{application}} of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> was in 1971, after Gurney retired from driving and began managing his own racing team full-time.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} lower surface ahead of <b>the</b> <b>flap</b> means the upper surface suction can be reduced while producing the same lift.|$|E

50|$|After First Officer Davtyan {{extended}} <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> to full, {{few seconds}} later, the master warning sounded, {{and continued to}} do so {{until the end of}} the recording. The speed at the time was too fast, which could tear <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> apart and could cause the plane to crash, similar to Austral Lineas Aereas Flight 2553. The plane was banking to the right. Flight 967 began a nose-down attitude and <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> then retracted to 18°. Captain Grigoryan then made an 11° nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the seat and panels, English saddles feature leather flaps on either side; <b>the</b> underside <b>flap</b> is called <b>the</b> sweat <b>flap,</b> and <b>the</b> upper <b>flap</b> is called <b>the</b> saddle <b>flap</b> (or, simply and appropriately, the [...] "flap"). <b>The</b> <b>flaps</b> sit between <b>the</b> rider's leg and the horse's side and protects the horse from being pinched by the stirrup leather or girth, and the rider's leg from being chafed by the girth buckles. On some saddles it is also specially padded to protect or support the rider's knee.|$|R

40|$|Variable camber {{actuator}} assemblies {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag performance is maximized for slotted flap wings. Lift is improved over {{a broader range of}} cruising speeds by varying wing camber with rotational flap movements that do not introduce wing slots and induced drag. Forward flaps are secured to forward flange links which extended from, and are a part of forward <b>flap</b> linkage assemblies. <b>The</b> forward <b>flaps</b> rotate about flap pivots with their rotational displacement controlled by variable camber actuator assemblies located between <b>the</b> forward <b>flaps</b> and <b>the</b> forward flange links. Rear flaps are held relative to <b>the</b> forward <b>flaps</b> by rear flap linkage assemblies which may act independently from <b>the</b> forward <b>flap</b> linkage assemblies and the variable camber actuator assemblies. Wing camber is varied by rotating <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> with <b>the</b> variable camber actuator assemblies while <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> are in a deployed or tucked position. Rotating <b>the</b> <b>flaps</b> in a tucked position does not introduce significant wing surface discontinuities, and reduces aircraft fuel consumption on most flight profiles...|$|R
