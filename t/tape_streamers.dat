50|$|Later, most tape drives of the 1980s {{introduced}} {{the use of}} an internal data buffer to somewhat reduce start-stop situations. These drives are often referred to as <b>tape</b> <b>streamers.</b> The tape was stopped only when the buffer contained no data to be written, or when it was full of data during reading. As faster tape drives became available, despite being buffered, the drives started to suffer from the shoe-shining sequence of stop, rewind, start.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic tape is {{a medium}} for {{magnetic}} recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a tape drive (<b>tape</b> unit, <b>streamer).</b>|$|R
25|$|For the {{magnetic}} tape sound recording Korn√©l Tolnai used magnetic tape {{as a medium}} for magnetic recording, made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic. Most audio, video and computer data storage is this type. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and later on video tape recorders.

5000|$|A unique {{aspect of}} the Apple Network Servers is their case: It is fully {{lockable}} and extremely accessible, it features a small LCD for diagnostics, and its front has seven device slots, with a CD-ROM and one hard drive mounted in them in the standard configuration. Additional hot-swappable SCSI hard drive modules or a DAT <b>tape</b> <b>streamer</b> {{can be added to}} the free slots. Optionally, the ANS 700 also supports redundant and hot-swappable power supply units and an internal drive rack for two further fixed hard drives. The case is large and heavy, at a height of 24.5 in, a width of 16.5 in, a depth of 18 in and a weight of over 80 lb, with exact weight depending on hardware configuration. That means that while it is about the right width for a 19-inch rack, it requires at least 14 rack units in height. A third model in a smaller rack-mount case without the large disk array, the Network Server 300 (code named [...] "Deep Dish", as in a deep dish pizza), never got past the prototype stage. Also in development but never released were CPU cards featuring two CPUs. Power Macintosh 9500 CPU cards, which were available with dual processors, were not compatible with the ANS.|$|R
40|$|Observations of teleseismic {{events at}} remote sites necessitated the develop-ment of a {{portable}} digital recorder that {{is capable of}} continuously recording the output of a three-component set of long-period transducers. A PC is used as a file management facility, operating in an intermittant or "sleeper mode. " Each of the three components are digitized and stored in separate, intelligent A to D cards. When 28 K samples have been generated, a trigger is initiated, and on the transition of the next real time second the real time is latched and power is applied to the PC. The sample count between the trigger and the latched acknowledgment of the trigger provides an absolute time correlation. After the PC has powered up, the data are down-loaded from the three acquisition cards to a PC hard disk and the latched real time forms the header label of the data file. Power is then removed from the PC. Sampling at about 15 samples per second, the PC is switched on every 33, 45 minutes. Boot-up and data down-loading uses approximately 5 watts average power. The associated long-period transducers (Guralp CMG 3) consume about 3 watts and the remain-ing electronics 2 watts. All the electronics are housed in a steel cabinet, and the system uses four solar panels charging two 1 OSAH batteries.

50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} ICL {{developed}} the DRS 300 in Kidsgrove, {{and ran down}} Utica. Launched in 1986, DRS 300 was a modular system consisting of A4-sized units designed {{to be placed on}} an office bookshelf. Modules containing a power supply (Kx), processor (Ax), hard and floppy disks (Dx), <b>streamer</b> <b>tape</b> (Sx) etc. were connected by SCSI. Initial models used a 6 MHz 80286 processor (A1 module) with up to 1 MB memory. Later modules used an 8 MHz processor (A2) or 80286 with 80287 maths coprocessor (A3) with up to 4 MB, and ran Concurrent CP/M-86 and later Concurrent DOS. Although this could run code developed under CP/M, PC DOS or MS-DOS, in practice available applications were limited because many shrink-wrapped packages developed for the IBM PC made use of direct access to the (IBM) hardware. This was addressed through use of softclone technology to intercept such calls. However, this required the continual release of patches for new application versions.|$|R
