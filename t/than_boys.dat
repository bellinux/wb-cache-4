Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has turns out to be Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls <b>than</b> <b>boys.</b> Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E

In mixed-gender {{as well as}} same-gender dyads, girls used more emotion {{explanations}} <b>than</b> did <b>boys.</b> Combined across dyad type, girls used more emotion labels <b>than</b> did <b>boys.</b> Girls used {{a higher proportion of}} collaborative speech acts <b>than</b> did <b>boys</b> in same-gender dyads, but girls and boys used the same amount in mixed-gender dyads. Whereas girls used a higher proportion of informing acts in mixed-gender dyads <b>than</b> did <b>boys,</b> <b>boys</b> used more <b>than</b> did girls in same-gender dyads.

5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{gradually}} increasing, the female literacy rate in India {{is less than}} the male literacy rate. Far fewer girls <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> are enrolled in school, and many girls drop out. In urban India, girls are nearly on a par with boys in terms of education. However, in rural India, girls continue to be less educated <b>than</b> <b>boys.</b> According to the National Sample Survey Data of 1997, only the states of Kerala and Mizoram have approached universal female literacy. According to scholars, the major factor behind improvements in the social and economic status of women in Kerala is literacy.|$|E
25|$|From 1970 to 1994, the {{enrollment}} of girls in primary education steadily increased from 30% to {{as high as}} 80%. However, differences exist between enrollment {{of males and females}} in all levels of education. In addition, the drop out rate of girls is higher <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> and participation in STEM classes are lower for girls <b>than</b> <b>boys.</b> In 2002, the combined gross enrollment for primary, secondary and tertiary schools for female was 57% compared to 71% for males. This translates into fewer women in certain economic fields as well. The percentages of female workers in some selected professions were as follow: architects, 2.4%, quantity surveyors, 3.5%, lawyers/jurists, 25.4%, lecturers, 11.8%, obstetricians and gynecologists, 8.4%, pediatricians, 33.3%, media practitioners, 18.3%.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the journal}} of Aggressive Behaviour, an {{analysis}} across 9 countries found boys reported more {{in the use of}} physical aggression. At the same time no consistent sex differences emerged within relational aggression. It has been found that girls are more likely <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> to use reactive aggression and then retract, but boys are more likely to increase rather than to retract their aggression after their first reaction. Studies show girls' aggressive tactics included gossip, ostracism, breaking confidences, and criticism of a victim's clothing, appearance, or personality, whereas boys engage in aggression that involves a direct physical and/or verbal assault. This could be {{due to the fact that}} girls' frontal lobes develop earlier <b>than</b> <b>boys,</b> allowing them to self-restrain.|$|E
25|$|Relational {{aggression}}, {{also known}} as covert aggression or covert bullying {{is a type of}} aggression in which harm is caused through damage to relationships or social status within a group rather than physical violence.

25|$|However, {{increasing}} {{access to}} secondary education (grade 9–12) remains a major challenge, {{as evidenced by}} the low net enrollment rate of 24% at this level. More than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools, and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling. In addition, fewer girls <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> join secondary schools and, among those who do, fewer complete the 10th grade.|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem <b>than</b> <b>boys.</b> Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E

Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty.

The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the repercussions}} of gender in toys {{suggests}} that play {{should be encouraged to}} be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> because of the societal value of masculinity.|$|E
25|$|Violence {{against women}} is a {{widespread}} global occurrence with serious public health implications. This {{is a result of}} social and gender bias. Many societies in developing nations function on a patriarchal framework, where women are often viewed as a form of property and as socially inferior to men. This unequal standing in the social hierarchy has led women to be physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by men, both as children and adults. These abuses usually constitute some form of violence. Although children of both sexes do suffer from physical maltreatment, sexual abuse, and other forms of exploitation and violence, studies have indicated that young girls are far more likely <b>than</b> <b>boys</b> to experience sexual abuse. In a 2004 study on child abuse, 25.3% of all girls surveyed experienced some form of sexual abuse, a percentage that is three times higher than that of boys (8.7%).|$|E
