5|$|Due {{to their}} lack of speed and their {{inability}} <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> or sting, millipedes' primary defence mechanism is to curl into a tight coil – protecting their delicate legs inside an armoured exoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Romanian vampires {{were said}} <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> their victims over the heart or between the eyes, and sudden deaths could {{indicate}} {{the presence of a}} vampire. Graves were often opened five or seven years after burial and the corpse checked for vampirism, before being washed and reburied.|$|E

50|$|Eris is a genus of {{the spider}} family Salticidae (jumping spiders). It is not a large spider and, {{although}} it is prone <b>to</b> <b>biting,</b> is not venomous to humans.|$|R
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant <b>to</b> <b>bite,</b> {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, are more likely <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss {{them back into the}} water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
5|$|The New York City Subway {{system is}} infested with rats. Rats are {{sometimes}} seen on platforms, and are commonly seen foraging through garbage thrown onto the tracks. They {{are believed to}} pose a health hazard, and on rare instances have been known <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> humans. Subway stations notorious for rat infestation include Chambers Street, Jay Street–MetroTech, West Fourth Street, Spring Street and 145th Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{aggressiveness}} {{of these}} snakes {{has been greatly}} exaggerated. In tests designed to measure the various behavioral responses by wild specimens to encounters with people, 23 of 45 (51%) tried to escape, while 28 of 36 (78%) resorted to threat displays and other defensive tactics. Only when they were picked up with a mechanical hand were they likely <b>to</b> <b>bite.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic order, Coleoptera, {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (<b>to</b> <b>bite),</b> leading to Middle English betylle. Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in names such as cockchafer, from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E
5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a}} lesser extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> and hold onto them for copulation. Whether {{there is a}} {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the sand}} devil {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young nourished by their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4–25 pups in spring or early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Though not {{normally}} aggressive towards humans, the sand devil can inflict serious wounds if provoked. Its common name refers to its habit of snapping vigorously at fishery workers when caught, and even {{out of the}} water it is capable of lunging upwards <b>to</b> <b>bite.</b> This shark is caught incidentally in bottom trawls operated by commercial fisheries targeting other species. It is edible but seldom brought to market. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks the data to list this species beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Vampire bats hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin <b>to</b> <b>bite.</b> They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|E
50|$|Humans are {{constantly}} fed on by haematophagous (blood feeding) insects. The ingested blood can be recovered {{and used to}} identify the person from which it was taken. Bite marks and reactions <b>to</b> <b>bites</b> {{can be used to}} place a person in an area where those insects are found.|$|R
40|$|Arthropod-borne {{pathogens}} {{are transmitted}} into a unique intradermal microenvironment {{that includes the}} saliva of their vectors. Immunomodulatory factors in the saliva can enhance infectivity; however, {{in some cases the}} immune response that develops to saliva from prior uninfected bites can inhibit infectivity. Most rodent reservoirs of Yersinia pestis experience fleabites regularly, but the effect this has on the dynamics of flea-borne transmission of plague has never been investigated. We examined the innate and acquired immune response of mice <b>to</b> <b>bites</b> of Xenopsylla cheopis and its effects on Y. pestis transmission and disease progression in both naïve mice and mice chronically exposed <b>to</b> flea <b>bites.</b> The immune response of C 57 BL/ 6 mice <b>to</b> uninfected flea <b>bites</b> was characterized by flow cytometry, histology, and antibody detection methods. In naïve mice, flea bites induced mild inflammation with limited recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages <b>to</b> the <b>bite</b> site. Infectivity and host response in naïve mice exposed <b>to</b> flea <b>bites</b> followed immediately by intradermal injection of Y. pestis did not differ from that of mice infected with Y. pestis without prior flea feeding. With prolonged exposure, an IgG 1 antibody response primarily directed to the predominant component of flea saliva, a family of 36 - 45 kDa phosphatase-like proteins, occurred in both laboratory mice and wild rats naturally exposed to X. cheopis, but a hypersensitivity response never developed. The incidence and progression of terminal plague following challenge by infective blocked fleas were equivalent in naïve mice and mice sensitized to flea saliva by repeated exposure <b>to</b> flea <b>bites</b> over a 10 -week period. Unlike what is observed with many other blood-feeding arthropods, the murine immune response to X. cheopis saliva is mild and continued exposure <b>to</b> flea <b>bites</b> leads more <b>to</b> tolerance than to hypersensitivity. The immune response to flea saliva had no detectable effect on Y. pestis transmission or plague pathogenesis in mice...|$|R

Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} progresses, Jericho finally {{makes his way}} to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch {{initiation}} exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him. When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to both use their powers and walk in sunlight. On some of his missions Jericho is accompanied by other Darkwatch forces including his new partner, a sultry and vicious temptress named Tala. Eventually, during their night of passion, Tala lures him <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> her and inherits some portion of his power, transforming herself into a half-vampire creature similar to him. She then betrays the Darkwatch from within, allowing hordes of the undead to invade its headquarters.|$|E
50|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{infection}} are {{being of the}} male sex, adulthood, and outdoor access. One case study conducted in São Paulo found that 75% of the FIV-infected cats were males. Higher rates of infection in males than females occurs due <b>to</b> <b>biting</b> being more frequently engaged in by males defending their territory.|$|R

5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E
