5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} horrors of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> stimulating {{the development of the}} abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s.

5|$|Abolitionists, notably William Wilberforce, {{continued}} {{their effort to}} end <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b> Britain passed <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa. The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.|$|E
40|$|Polygyny {{rates are}} higher in Western Africa than in Eastern Africa. <b>The</b> African <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> explain this difference. More male slaves were {{exported}} in <b>the</b> trans-Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> from Western Africa, while more female slaves were exported in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> from Eastern Africa. <b>The</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> led to prolonged periods of abnormal sex ratios, which impacted {{the rates of}} polygyny across Africa. In order to assess these claims, we construct a unique ethnicity-level data set linking current rates of polygyny with historical trade flow data from <b>the</b> African <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Our OLS estimates show {{a positive correlation between}} <b>the</b> trans-Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> and polygyny. An IV approach shows the relationship is causal and statistically signicant. We also provide cross-country evidence corroborating our findings. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There is {{controversy}} about whether geography matters {{mainly because of}} its contemporaneous impact on economic outcomes or because of its interaction with historical events. Looking at terrain ruggedness, {{we are able to}} estimate the importance of these two channels. Because rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, it has a negative direct effect on income. However, in Africa rugged terrain afforded protection to those being raided during <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> retarded subsequent economic development, in Africa ruggedness also has had a historical indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we find that both effects are significant statistically and that for Africa the indirect positive effect dominates the direct negative effect. Looking within Africa, we provide evidence that the indirect effect operates through <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> We also show that <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades,</b> by encouraging population concentrations in rugged areas, have also amplified the negative direct impact o...|$|R
5|$|Hull was {{an early}} theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars. Its 18th century Member of Parliament, William Wilberforce, took a {{prominent}} part in the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In early 1787, Thomas Clarkson, {{a fellow}} {{graduate}} of St John's, Cambridge, {{who had become}} convinced {{of the need to}} end <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> after writing a prize-winning essay on the subject while at Cambridge, called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a published copy of the work.

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E

5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> and the African squadron {{was formed in}} 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{show that}} geography, through {{its impact on}} history, can have {{important}} effects on current economic development. The analysis focuses on the historic interaction between ruggedness and Africa’s <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Although rugged terrain hinders trade and most productive activities, negatively affecting income globally, within Africa rugged terrain afforded protection to those being raided during <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades</b> retarded subsequent economic development, within Africa ruggedness has also had a historic indirect positive effect on income. Studying all countries worldwide, we estimate the differential effect of ruggedness on income for Africa. We show that the differential effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be explained by other factors like Africa’s unique geographic environment, and it is fully {{accounted for by the}} history of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trades...</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the British and United States' bans on <b>the</b> African <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in 1808, it declined, but {{the period}} after still {{accounted}} for 28.5% {{of the total}} volume of <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{international}} <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> {{was banned}} in all states except South Carolina, by 1800. Finally in 1807, President Jefferson called for and {{signed into law}} a Federally-enforced ban on <b>the</b> international <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> throughout <b>the</b> U.S. and its territories. It became a federal crime to import or export a <b>slave.</b> However, <b>the</b> domestic <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> was allowed, for expansion, or for diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory.|$|R
5|$|By 1670, {{the city}} had 6,000tons of shipping, of which half was used for {{importing}} tobacco. By the late 17th century and early 18th century, this shipping was also playing {{a significant role in}} <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became {{an important part of}} the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E
50|$|Africa has a {{long history}} of interracial mixing with male Arab and European explorers, traders and {{soldiers}} having sexual relations with black African women as well as taking them as wives. Arabs played a big role in <b>the</b> African <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> and unlike <b>the</b> trans-atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> most of <b>the</b> black African <b>slaves</b> in <b>the</b> Arab <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> were women. Most of them were used as sexual <b>slaves</b> by <b>the</b> Arab men and some were even taken as wives.|$|R
50|$|Slave {{relationships}} in Africa {{have been transformed}} through three large-scale processes: <b>the</b> Arab <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> emancipation policies and movements in the 19th and 20th century. Each of these processes significantly changed the forms, level, and economics of slavery in Africa.|$|R
50|$|A slave {{market is}} a place where slaves are bought and sold. Such markets became a key {{phenomenon}} in the history of slavery, particularly in <b>the</b> Arab <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> and <b>the</b> interregional <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> of <b>the</b> United States.|$|R
5|$|The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> {{was founded}} in 1787. The next year Parliament passed the first law {{regulating}} <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> {{to limit the number}} of slaves per ship. Then in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners in cases in which slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the African slave trade. A monument to the killed slaves on Zong was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.|$|E

50|$|The {{volume of}} the total Dutch Indian Ocean <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> has been {{estimated}} to be about 15-30% of <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> slightly smaller than <b>the</b> trans-Saharan <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> and one-and-a-half to {{three times the size}} of the Swahili and Red Sea coast and the Dutch West India Company <b>slave</b> <b>trades.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1730, the {{monopoly}} of the Dutch West India Company on <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> was lifted.

5|$|Wilberforce and Clarkson had {{collected}} a {{large volume of}} evidence against <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> over the previous two decades, and Wilberforce spent {{the latter part of}} 1806 writing A Letter on the Abolition of <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade,</b> which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists' case. The death of Fox in September 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. Slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist MPs into the House of Commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts. Wilberforce was re-elected as an MP for Yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his Letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{life and}} work have been commemorated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In Westminster Abbey, a seated statue of Wilberforce by Samuel Joseph was erected in 1840, bearing an epitaph praising his Christian {{character}} and his long labour to abolish <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> and slavery itself.|$|E
5|$|Abolition {{continued}} to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. In 1795, the Society for Effecting the Abolition of <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> ceased to meet, and Clarkson retired in ill-health to the Lake District. However, despite the decreased interest in abolition, Wilberforce {{continued to}} introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that more than half}} of <b>the</b> entire <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> took place during the 18th century, with the British, Portuguese and French being the main carriers of nine out of ten slaves abducted in Africa.
