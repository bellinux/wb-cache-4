25|$|Many {{philosophers}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Kierkegaard's greatest {{contributions to}} philosophy is {{his critique of}} Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, {{and it will be a}} very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{another letter}} home Barton confesses {{that he has}} become {{hardened}} by his experiences in the war. He also states <b>that</b> John <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most difficult experiences is {{getting used to the}} new faces as so many soldiers die.|$|R
5000|$|... "Looking at it {{that way}} we all tend to go insane a little bit, I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> ok. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the things the album is saying - it is ok to go insane, it can be quite cathartic actually, to watch {{yourself}} go out to the edge and sort of reel yourself back in - now hopefully you do reel yourself back in." ...|$|R

50|$|It {{is unknown}} where Senedj was buried. Toby Wilkinson {{assumes that the}} king might have been buried at Sakkara. To support this view, Wilkinson makes the {{observation}} that mortuary priests in earlier times were never buried {{too far away from}} the king for whom they had practised the mortuary cult. Wilkinson <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Great Southern Galleries within the Necropolis of King Djoser (3rd dynasty) was originally Senedj's tomb.|$|R

60|$|I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the causes}} of these {{repeated}} failures is that our best and greatest men have greatly underestimated {{the size of this}} question. They have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores--plasters too small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have proved temporary--so evanescent.|$|E

"As for Ruggiero Mocenigo, he is {{a disgrace}} to {{the name of a}} Venetian; and it is sad to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> our most noble {{families}} should have to bear the brand of being connected with a man so base and villainous.

[...] If guitarist King writes a good song, Araya puts his beliefs aside, [...] "I'm not <b>one</b> <b>that's</b> going to go, 'This sucks because it's contrary to my beliefs.'

6000|$|... "And so let {{the subject}} pass," [...] she concluded, [...] "but it saddens me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the great sorrows {{of the world}} should be there like a {{monument}} to spoil the wonder of this morning.

50|$|The {{second thing}} is our team. We are going to invest {{millions}} in this space.

And I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most fundamental things about it, is the talent.|$|R
5000|$|Schrader once {{described}} Milius' writing as containing too many good lines and scenes. He says Warren Beatty once [...] "told John something I've been telling him too: 'You come too soon {{and you come}} too often.' I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his problems: he's so full of juice he just can't stop coming, rather than holding back and tightening the situation and building characters. That releasing diffuses the energy, the characters are too broad because they never have time {{to build up the}} inner strength." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] exclaimed Madame Merle, [...] "I've great faults, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> then; it {{certainly}} isn't the greatest. I {{came into the}} world in the Brooklyn navy-yard. My father was a high officer in the United States Navy, and had a post--a post of responsibility--in that establishment at the time. I suppose I ought to love the sea, but I hate it. That's why I don't return to America. I love the land; the great thing is to love something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Fentolin is in {{a strange}} humour," [...] she went on, a moment later, after she had struck the final chords of her song. [...] "There are things going on around us which no one can understand. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his schemes has miscarried; he has gone too far. He {{suspects}} you; I cannot tell you why or how. If only you would go away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suzanne!" [...] I called, [...] "Suzanne!" [...] for I {{thought that}} she was in her chamber; but the girl, knowing that Piet van Vooren was here, had slipped out, and of this he was aware. He knew, moreover, where she had gone, for I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his Kaffir {{servants}} was watching outside and told him, and thither he followed her and made love to her.|$|E
60|$|So {{now they}} were very proud to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their own number {{actually}} had frightened him, {{and they began to}} look on Buster Bear as a real hero.

Whenever they met one another, all they could talk about was the smartness and the greatness of Buster Bear.|$|E
50|$|Having {{been kidnapped}} by a crazed Tuco, Walt and Jesse are held {{prisoner}} {{in a desert}} hideout where he takes care of his sick uncle, the seemingly-mute Hector Salamanca.

Hank and the DEA have rounded up Tuco's entire organization, and Tuco <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his associates ratted him out.

[...] (Comparing Wordplay with I.O.U.S.A.)“There's such a huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor in this country, and I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why consumerism is so rampant. A {{lot of us have}} become addicted to a lifestyle we can't afford. We're immersed in the culture of excess, so it's going to get really ugly when it has to stop.

5000|$|Even though Jackie Robinson {{became the}} first black player in modern major league history in April 1947, Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier that July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945, 1946, and 1947. Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, old fellow," [...] said Morris, [...] "it is {{a capital}} {{idea to have}} all ready in case {{we want to go}} horse backing, but don't you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your snappy {{carriages}} with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purpose?

60|$|I {{realized}} {{too that}} it is less flattering to compare oneself with the very little things of the world than with the great. Given time, I might scale an Alp; I could only kill an ant.

How much less afflicting at times would my present have been if I had {{had the foresight to}} remind myself how beguiling it would appear as the past. Even my old sharpest sorrows have now hushed themselves to sleep, and those for whom I have sorrowed are as quiet.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a dark}} unwarrantable deed, but it was unpremeditated, and {{necessarily}} unknown, at first, to any but the perpetrators, so that {{it would}} be inexcusably unfair to saddle it upon the great body of the Covenanters, who, {{as far as we can}} ascertain from their writings and opinions, condemned it, although, naturally, they could not but feel relieved to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their chief persecutors was for evermore powerless for further evil, and some of them refused to admit that the deed was murder. They justified it by the case of Phinehas. A better apology lies in the text, [...] "oppression maketh a wise man mad." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for Digital Spy, lead singer Wyatt explained the video, [...] "We really liked director Andreas's images and I think they go together {{in a way that}} feels truthful with what we do. As Stephen Colbert would say, truthiness will come out in different ways for different people. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the strengths of his work because it matches our sound and you can read into it in different ways. The 'Paddling Out' clip is the first episode of more videos. We'll see, we don't really know exactly what's going to happen." ...|$|R

I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the aspects of being an army kid. It is <b>one</b> thing <b>that</b> is common among almost every army brat.

5000|$|Common (Elam Ferguson) {{spoke about}} the audience's {{perception}} of the American frontier through Elam: [...] "We haven't seen a character like this from that time period, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was important. <b>One</b> thing <b>that</b> I've really appreciated about Elam is that he's a leader and very intelligent. He cares for people, he's passionate, and has his own dream, and thinks for himself. You know, he's a human being. And I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most important things}} that people can learn from Hell on Wheels and that time period is that people were people. Some of the same things that we go through now, they experienced." ...|$|R
