[...] Later, responding to the assistant District Attorney's questions during the trial, Turner testified that he was laughing because he found the situation, [...] "ridiculous." [...] Arndt rapidly joined the chase, helping to pin Turner down when he was apprehended. A bystander at the dumpster called emergency services. Meanwhile, two other passersby arrived to aid Arndt and Jonsson in holding the assailant. Campus police arrived moments later, questioned Turner, and then arrested him.|$|R

I can identify three other members of the organization: Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Richard Boes ... You have to have a facial structure such that you could be related to, or be a son of, Lee Marvin. There are no women, obviously, in the organization. We have communiques and secret meetings. Other than that, I can't talk about it." [...] Jarmusch revealed in a 1992 interview that the real son of Lee Marvin, Christopher, had objected to the existence of the organization in an encounter with Waits at a bar: Six months ago Tom Waits was in a bar in somewhere like Sonoma County in Northern California, and the bartender said, ”You’re Tom Waits, right? A guy over there wants to talk to you.”Tom went over to this dark corner booth and the guy sitting there said, ”Sit down, I want to talk to you.”So Tom started getting a little aggressive: ”What <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{want to talk to me}} about? I don’t know you.”And the guy said, ”What is this bullshit about the Sons of Lee Marvin?”Tom said, ”Well, it’s a secret organization and I’m not supposed to talk about it.”The guy said, ”I don’t like it.”Tom said, ”What’s it to you?”The guy said, ”I’m Lee Marvin’s son”—and he really was.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} show that NSM {{techniques}} of semantic and pragmatic analysis allow an integrated semantic-pragmatic approach {{to the use of}} "swear words" and "curse (cuss) words". The paper begins with a lexical semantic exegesis of the lexical items swear word and curse word. This is helpful to delimit and conceptualise the phenomena being studied, and it also hints at some interesting differences between the speech cultures of Australian English and American English. Subsequent sections propose semantic explications for a string of swear/curse words and expressions as used in Australian English, including: exclamations (Shit! Fuck! Damn! Christ! Jesus!), abuse formulas (Fuck you!, Damn you!), interrogative and imperative formulas (e. g. Who <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think you are?; Get the hell out of here!), and the free use of expressive adjectives, such as fucking and goddamn, in angry swearing. A novel aspect of these explications, with interesting implications for the relationship between semantics and pragmatics, is the proposal that the explications incorporate a Metalexical Awareness section, modelling speaker awareness of the particular words being used and ethno metapragmatic knowledge about their status in the community of discourse. The study goes on {{to address the issue of}} so-called social or conversational swearing. I propose cultural scripts to capture some Anglo ethnopragmatic assumptions about how the use of swear/curse words can be affected by perceptions of familiarity, solidarity, and mutuality. Differences between Australian English and American English in the use of swear/curse words expressions, and in attitudes towards such use, are discussed briefly. Overall, the study seeks to show how semantic explications and cultural scripts can work together to produce an integrated and explanatory account of a speech phenomenon which stands at the crossroads of pragmatics, semantics, and sociolinguistics.
