5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from <b>the</b> <b>population</b> (<b>and</b> is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
