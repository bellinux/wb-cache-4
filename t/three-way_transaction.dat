50|$|The Tribune Company {{acquired}} KCPQ in August 1998, {{as part of}} Kelly Broadcasting's {{exit from}} the television business. The deal was structured as a <b>three-way</b> <b>transaction,</b> in which Kelly sold the station to the Meredith Corporation, which then swapped it to Tribune in exchange for its Atlanta station WGNX. Following the purchase of channel 13, Tribune merged KCPQ's operations with those of KTWB-TV (channel 22, now KZJO), which Tribune had acquired earlier in 1998. The two stations became co-owned in 1999, after the FCC began to allow same-market duopolies.|$|E
5000|$|It is the {{successor}} to a commercial modern rock station in WWCD; that station relocated to the Baltimore-licensed 102.5 MHz frequency {{as part of a}} <b>three-way</b> ownership <b>transaction.</b> Likewise, WOSA's [...] "Classical 101" [...] slogan is a reflection of WWCD's long identity as [...] "CD101." ...|$|R
5000|$|The station {{originally}} {{operated on}} the 101.1 MHz facility licensed to Grove City - hence the original [...] "CD101" [...] branding - from August 21, 1990 until June 30, 2010.

50|$|The {{surviving}} {{parts of}} the inscription describe an additional <b>three-way</b> real-estate <b>transaction</b> concerning a small orchard (of three GUR) in the Sealand where the vendor sells his property to {{the governor of the}} Sealand, presumably his overlord, who in turn passes it on to the king, thereby relinquishing all claim over its jurisdiction. The main bequest was located in the province of Malgû, on the Tigris, south of its confluence with the Diyala. A later literary work, known as the Berlin letter, provides a historical background where an Elamite king, who may be Šutruk-Naḫḫunte, claimed he married the eldest daughter of Meli-Šipak and this may be the purpose of this legal text, to arrange a substantial dowry for a diplomatic marriage, legitimized with the intercession of the goddess Nanaya. The subject matter of the second and third columns dwells on the provision of a prebend and ritual arrangements for the cult of deity, suggesting an alternative purpose for the bequest, that of elevating Ḫunnubat-Nanaya to a senior priestess position through the largesse of her father.|$|R
50|$|On October 8, 2009 WNYC {{took control}} of {{classical}} music station WQXR-FM, then at 96.3. WQXR's intellectual property (call letters and format) was acquired from the New York Times Company {{as part of a}} <b>three-way</b> <b>transaction</b> with Univision Radio. WNYC also purchased the 105.9 FM frequency of Univision's WCAA (now WXNY-FM). WQXR-FM's classical format moved to 105.9 and WXNY's Spanish Tropical format debuted at 96.3. The deal resulted in WQXR becoming a non-commercial station. With WQXR as a co-owned 24-hour classical station, WNYC-FM dropped its remaining classical music programming to become a full-time news/talk station.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{for help}} up front {{to improve the}} club's offence, Philadelphia dealt Parent and a second-round pick in the 1971 NHL Amateur Draft (Rick Kehoe) to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Bruce Gamble and a first-round {{selection}} (Pierre Plante) in the same draft in a <b>three-way</b> <b>transaction</b> that also involved Boston on January 31, 1971. The Flyers acquired Rick MacLeish and Danny Schock from the Bruins who received Mike Walton from the Maple Leafs. The trade {{turned out to be}} a positive turn for Parent. In Toronto, Parent joined his boyhood hero, Jacques Plante, who at 42 was having an all-star season. Under Plante's tutelage, Parent became a more consistent and technically proficient goalie. Parent played well for the Leafs through the 1971-72 season, gaining valuable regular season and playoff experience.|$|E
