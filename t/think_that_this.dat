There seems to be the mistaken idea that it would be {{necessary}} to close the roads. This, of course, is entirely wrong... There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport.|$|E
25|$|I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women {{just as there}} are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
25|$|Boyer moves {{outside the}} leading {{currents}} in mainstream cognitive psychology {{and suggests that}} we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Yugoslav {{members of}} the Albanian Communist Party had begun to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a plot by Tito who {{intended}} to destabilize the Party. Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania {{was that it was}} too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.|$|E

Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E
25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> can be because {{of the significance of}} wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E

25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

500|$|As {{the longest}} living known orca, Granny is {{employed}} {{as an example}} in arguments against keeping whales in captivity, referencing the allegedly reduced lifespan of captive animals. The oldest orca in captivity is the 50-year-old Lolita {{who is at the}} Miami Seaquarium. The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years. Of Granny's age, Captain Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching said [...] " [...] it’s mind-blowing to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> whale is over 100 years old. [...] She was born before the Titanic went down. Can you imagine the things she’s seen in her lifetime?" ...|$|E
500|$|Busch {{had little}} contact with his natural parents during this period. At the time, the [...] journey between Wiedensahl and Ebergötzen took three days by horse. His father visited Ebergötzen {{two to three times}} a year, while his mother stayed in Wiedensahl to look after the children. The 12-year-old Busch visited his family once; his mother at first did not {{recognize}} him. Some Busch biographers <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> early separation from his parents, especially from his mother, resulted in his eccentric bachelorhood. In the autumn of 1846, Busch moved with the Kleine's to Lüthorst, where, on 11 April 1847, he was confirmed.|$|E

500|$|The inquest in August 1971 was {{not able}} to {{establish}} the exact sequence of events. [...] It was established that all three were shot at very close range, probably in a line. All had been drinking, and Joseph was found to be severely intoxicated. The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves beside the road. The coroner commented: [...] "You may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was not only murder, but one of the vilest crimes ever heard of in living memory". The bodies were heaped {{on top of each other}} with two beer glasses lying near to them. After failing to return to their barracks by 18:30 the three were listed as AWOL. Their bodies were found by children at 21:30.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on {{his theory}} of atoll {{formation}} was published in May 1842 after {{more than three years}} of work, and he then wrote his first [...] "pencil sketch" [...] of {{his theory of}} natural selection. To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
