The calibration curves for both compounds gave good linearity {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 6 μg/mL whole blood. The detection limits (signal to noise ratio = 3) were 0. 05 μg/mL for acetonitrile and 0. 01 μg/mL for propionitrile. The coefficients of intra-day variations were 1. 0 % at 0. 4 μg/mL and 1. 7 % at 2 μg/mL for acetonitrile; 7. 1 % at 0. 4 μg/mL and 1. 0 % at 2 μg/mL for propionitrile.

40|$|The <b>Thermionic</b> Thermal <b>Detector</b> (TTD) senses {{infrared}} radiation by temperature modulation of thermionic emission current within a silicon Schottky diode. The thermionic emission current is the well known Richardson dark current. The TTD operates in the LWIR band. The physics of TTD operation {{is distinct from}} that of silicon Schottky barrier MWIR detectors, such as PtSi/Si {{which are based on}} internal photoemission. In fact, the TTD has high detection efficiency. The architecture of a TTD array is very similar to that of microbolometer arrays, except the detector elements are thermally isolated Schottky diodes, operating under reverse bias. When the TTD array is illuminated by an infrared image, the temperature of individual detector elements will vary with the local incident power of the image. Under small signal conditions, the dark current of individual detectors will vary as temperature, resulting in an electronic image of the infrared scene. The reverse bias dark current of a Schottky diode varies exponentially with temperature. For the small temperature variations observed on the focal plane of an uncooled sensor, this variation is approximately linear. The rate of temperature variation is determined by the Schottky barrier potential and, to a lesser extent by the applied bias potential. The operating temperature range of the detector can be designed into the device by selecting a metal with the appropriate Schottky barrier height. Experimental Schottky barrier heights were determined using Richardson dark current activation energy analysis. Devices optimized for operation at room ambient temperature have a 6 %/K temperature coefficient. The use of Schottky diod...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} development of new analytical techniques to characterize shale oil, with emphasis on the heteroorganic compounds. ^ A class separation precedure using preparative liquid chromatography on an amino-bonded silica support was developed to allow separation of shale oil into four chemical classes, namely: (1) hydrocarbons (alkanes/alkenes), (2) polynuclear aromatics, (3) acids and neutral polars, and (4) bases. This procedure was applied to the analysis of two different types of shale oil, Tosco II and In-Situ. All four classes of compounds were then characterized by capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and some were also examined with the <b>thermionic</b> nitrogen specific <b>detector.</b> The acids and bases were further characterized by capillary gas chromatography with interfaced mass spectroscopy. Comparison of the two oils showed that although the level of heteroorganic compounds is different, the distribution of compounds within the same class is very similar. ^ An argentation liquid chromatographic procedure was developed for isolation of the thiophenic compounds in shale oil. This is an important class of compounds to study since it encompasses approximately 80 % of the organic sulfur content. Existing methods for isolation of thiophenes depend on a chemical reaction step. These methods fail to maintain the integrity of the thiophenes due either to discrimination dependent on the alkyl substituents present or to chemical alteration of some of the compounds. The argentation procedure avoided this discrimination since the retention time on the liquid chromatographic column was almost independent of the number and type of alkyl substituents on the thiophene ring. From direct comparison with the existing chemical methods, the argentation procedure was shown to be superior in recovering the thiophenes without discrimination. ...|$|R

The nitriles were overall only weakly correlated with CO, which is reasonable considering the greater diversity of sources for CO. However, strong correlations with CO were observed on several nights under stable atmospheric conditions and suggest regional combustion-based sources for the nitriles. These results demonstrate that the GC-FTD instrument is capable of making long term, in-situ measurements of HCN in the lower atmosphere. To date, similar measurements have not been performed, yet they are critically needed to (1) better evaluate the regional scale distribution of HCN in the atmosphere and (2) discern the influence of biomass burning on surface air composition in remote regions...|$|E

These studies have resulted in the setting up of an anti-doping control for equestrian competitions of various types, not only flat racing. During events, horses, must be calm and docile to the riders' order. Frequently, the latter use tranquillizers to try and win events. The analytical method for the research and identification of these compounds is described. The technique involves successively: 1. alkalinisation of the sample - saliva, blood or urine after enzymatic hydrolysis. 2. extraction with diethyl ether - the recovery is 70 % to 90 % depending upon the drug. 3. determination by gas-liquid chromatography with use of a retention index for qualitative analysis. We can detect up to fifteen tranquillizers in any one sample, even when present at such low concentrations as found in saliva. The use of the retention index is a reliable method for qualitative analysis. For example, the method has been used for three years, during which period the rentention index of acetylpromazine remained at 3240 +/- 7. The chromatographic analysis was performed on 3 % OV- 17 at 290 degrees. The chromatographic analysis has been performed by three columns of different polarity (OV- 1; OV- 17; SP- 2250).

The 7 -μm fibre, designed for the analysis of semi-volatile analytes was used to investigate the effect of desorption temperature and on-column focusing temperatures on peak response. The desorption temperature was found to be non-critical and an optimum focusing temperature of 40 °C was used throughout the analysis. Evaluation of the 100 -μm film fibre demonstrated its potential to adsorb greater quantities of analyte from solution and this study established that an adsorption time of 15 min gave an equilibrium distribution of the solutes between the stationary and liquid phases.

The net electric field in the three discharges has been determined from the termination of 1 s 2 s 1 SÂº - 1 snp 1 P 1 Rydberg series, from the Stark splitting and also from the observed energy shift of the spectral lines. In the homemade DC glow discharge, the net electric field is measured {{as a function of}} applied voltage at a constant gas pressure, as a function of gas pressure at a constant applied voltage and as a function of radial distance from the electrode centers. A comparison of the electric field distribution in the three discharges is described based on the Rydberg series termination, Stark shift, line broadening, and relative intensities of the observed spectral lines. The next studies are devoted to the measurements of photoionization cross sections of the excited states of helium and lithium using the saturation technique. A DC glow discharge has been used to measure the photoionization cross sections of the 3 p 1 p and 3 p 3 p excited states of helium, at threshold and in the near threshold region (0 - 2 eV) using a simple experimental setup. A smooth frequency dependence of the cross section has been observed for both the excited states in accordance to the theoretical calculations. A <b>thermionic</b> diode ion <b>detector</b> has been used for the measurements of photoionization cross sections from the 4 s 2 S, 4 p 2 p and 4 d 2 D excited states of lithium above the first ionization threshold. The behavior of the photoionization cross sections from n = 4 and â„“ = 0, 1, 2 excited states have been investigated. A smooth wavelength dependence of photo ionization cross section has been observed for the 4 p and 4 d excited states, which decrease monotonically with the decrease in the ionizing laser wavelength however the falloff for the 4 d excited state is purely hydrogenic. The cross section for the 4 s excited state first increases, attains a maximum value and then decreases monotonically with a decrease in the ionizing wavelength-strictly nonhydrogenic. The measured values of the cross sections are in good agreement with the earlier reported theoretical and experimental values. In addition, the oscillator strength distribution in discrete and continuous regions of the spectra of helium and lithium has been determined. A low-pressure RP glow discharge has been used for the measurement of oscillator strength distribution in helium while a <b>thermionic</b> diode ion <b>detector</b> has been used for the determination of oscillator strength distribution in lithium. The saturation technique has been employed to determine the photoionization cross section from the 2 s 1 SÂº excited state of helium and from 3 s 2 S 1 / 2 excited state of lithium at and above the first ionization threshold.

In the next set of experiments, the absolute photoionization cross 			section from the 3 s 3 p 1 P 1 excited states of magnesium isotopes have 			been measured in the energy region from the first ionization 			threshold up to 1. 4 eV excess energy. For these studies a two-step 			photoionization and saturated ionization technique has been employed 			in conjunction with an atomic beam source and a Time of Flight (TOF) 			mass spectrometer. The Time of Flight mass spectrometer enables us 			to separate the three stable isotopes of magnesium on the time axis. 			The absolute value of the photoionization cross sections from the 			 3 s 3 p 1 P 1 excited state near the 3 s ionization threshold is measured 			as 90 ± 16 Mb (at 354. 5 nm ionizing wavelength) for the dominating 			isotope (24 Mg) whereas the value {{at the peak of the}} 3 p 2 1 S 0 			auto-ionizing resonance is determined as 785 ± 141 Mb. The present 			experimentally measured photoionization cross sections are compared 			with the existing experimental and theoretical work showing 			excellent agreement. 			The next studies are devoted to the new measurements of the 			oscillator strengths for the 4 s 2 S 1 / 2 np 2 P 1 / 2, 3 / 2 (19 n 57), 			 3 p 2 P 3 / 2 nd 2 D 5 / 2, 3 / 2 (13 n 48) and 3 p 2 P 1 / 2 nd 2 D 3 / 2 (13 			n 50) Rydberg transitions of sodium. For these measurements the 			two-photon and two-step laser excitation techniques have been 			employed using a <b>thermionic</b> diode ion <b>detector</b> in conjunction with 			Nd: YAG pumped dye lasers. The measured f-values have been 			calibrated with the photoionization cross-sections determined as 			 0. 65 (0. 10), 7. 9 (1. 3) and 6. 7 (1. 1) Mb from the 4 s 2 S 1 / 2, 3 p 2 P 3 / 2 and 			 3 p 2 P 1 / 2 intermediate states at the first ionization threshold 			respectively. In addition, we have determined the binding energy of 			the 4 s 2 S 1 / 2 level as 15709. 444 (8) cm- 1 by employing the Rydberg 			relation to the observed np 2 P 1 / 2, 3 / 2 transitions. Addition of the 			binding energy to the known energy of the 4 s 2 S 1 / 2 level, the value 			of the first ionization potential of sodium is determined as 			 41449. 44 (1) cm- 1. A comparison of the experimentally determined 			results shows good agreement with the existing data...|$|R

Epicuticular wax in plants also determine its susceptibility to disease, and herbivore, desiccation and ultraviolet radiation damage. The epicuticular wax consisting of hydrocarbons and some volatile compounds of the leaves of Kigelia pinnata (Kigelia africana; family Bignoniaceae), a multimedicinal plant, was extracted, isolated and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively for the various chemical compositions using GC (equipped with a flame <b>thermionic</b> <b>detector</b> -GC/FTD) and GCMS (“GCMS-QP 2010 Plus, which employs a dual inlet Turbo Molecular Pump (TMP) that provides increased sensitivity and column flow capacity for improved performance and confident results. The evaluation is useful for the future comprehensive analysis of the constituents responsible for the various documented medicinal uses of the leaf. The extracted constituent revealed twelve compounds with the major ones identified as n-hentriacontane (55. 40 %) : a probable anti-tumour compound; 1 -tricosene, (18. 45 %); 11 - (2, 2 - dimethylpropyl) heneicosane, (9. 66 %); 2, 6, 10 -trimethyldodecane, (4. 43 %); pentafluoroheptadecyl ester, (4. 40 %); 2 -ethylhexyloctadecyl sulfurous acid ester, (3. 05 %); heneicosane, (1. 61 %); and hexyloctyl sulphurous acid ester, (1. 42 %). Other compounds are recorded in minute quantities. The major component, identified as hentriacontane, a C- 31 saturated hydrocarbon apparently is responsible for the plant susceptibility to diseases, protection against UV radiation and for the antitumour and antioxidative potential of the plant. This will give credence to the traditional use of the plant as an anti-inflammatory and anticancer. The ability of the plant to act as anti-sun burn {{may be due to the}} presence of the wax...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to study the bound and autoionizing Rydberg states of {{ytterbium}} employing the multistep and multiphoton laser excitation schemes {{in conjunction with a}} <b>thermionic</b> diode ion <b>detector.</b> Different intermediate levels have been used, 6 s 5 dI D 2, 6 s 6 p 3 pI, 6 s 7 s 3 SI and 4 f 13 (2 F 7 / 2) 6 s 2 6 d[3 / 2]I to record the spectra of ytterbium. The 6 s 5 dI D 2 intermediate level was populated via a two-photon excitation and the second laser was scanned to observe the l = 1 and 3 Rydberg levels. The 6 s 6 p 3 PI intermediate level was populated via single photon excitation and from this level the upper levels were excited via two-photon absorption. As a result, in the bound region, the 6 snf 1, 3 F 3 (9 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30), 6 snpI pI (12 â‰¤ n â‰¤ S 6), 6 snp 3 PI (12 â‰¤ n â‰¤ SO) and 6 snp 2 P 2 (12 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 42) Rydberg series have been observed. Three new levels due to the 4 f-innershell excitation 4 p 13 5 d 2 6 s 3 D 3, 4 f 13 5 d 2 6 sI F 3 and 4 f 13 5 d 2 6 s 3 G 3, which serve as perturbers have been identified. In order to describe the interchannel interactions among the J = 2 and J = 3 channels, the multichannel quantum defect theory have been used which supplements the level assignments. To approach the levels lying above the first ionization threshold, the 4 f 13 (2 F 7 / 2) 6 s 2 6 d[3 / 2] 1 intennediate level was populated via the 6 s 7 s 3 S 1 level (two-photon excitation) while the third laser was scanned. The first measurements of the even parity autoionizing resonances due to the 4 f-innershell excitation are reported using three-color four-photon resonant excitation technique. The 4 f 13 (F 7 / 2) 6 s 2 np[5 / 2] 2 (12 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 4 S) and 4 f 13 (2 F 7 / 2) 6 s 2 nf [5 / 2] 2 (9 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 33) have been observed.

40|$|Multi-photon and {{multi-step}} excitation schemes {{have been}} used to investigate the spectra of strontium in the discrete and autoionization regions using two different experimental arrangements, a <b>thermionic</b> diode ion <b>detector</b> and an atomic beam apparatus, in conjunction with a Nd: YAG pumped dye laser system. In the first experiment we have recorded the laser assisted collisionally induced sequential excitation and ionization spectrum of strontium using the two-photon excitation scheme. This experiment covers both direct two-photon excitation from the ground state and the sequential excitation from the 5 s 5 p IPI level. The intensity variations among the 5 snd 1 D 2 and 3 D 2 are discussed in the light of its interactions with the 4 d 6 s 1 D 2 and 3 D 2 interlopers. To supplement the experiment their interactions are parameterized using two channels MQDT-model, which seem to be appropriate to describe the 5 snd 1, 3 D 2 series perturbations. In the second experiment an even parity isolated autoionizing resonance (4 d 2 + 4 p 2) 1 D 2 has been studied via direct two-photon excitation from the ground state and via the 5 s 5 p 1 P 1 intermediate level. It is observed that although the width of the autoionizing resonance remains constant and is independent of the excitation mechanism but its line shape q-parameter does depend on the excitation path. In the third, experiment three-photon excitation four-photon ionization spectra of strontium have been recorded in the laser energy region from 14970 - 15350 cm- 1. The 5 snp 1 P 1 and 5 snf, 1 F 3 Rydberg series have been identified along with an additional dominating signal, lying adjacent to the three-photon ionization threshold, arising from two-photon resonant three-photon ionization through the 5 s 6 s 1 S 0 level. In the fourth experiment while using two-color three-photon excitation scheme a number of odd parity autoionizing Rydberg series possessing J=l, 2 and 3 have been recorded attached to the 4 d 2 D 3 / 2, 5 / 2 ionic levels excited via 4 d 2 3 p 0 and 4 d 2 3 P 2 intermediate levels. It is observed that the Rydberg levels attached to the 4 d 2 D 3 / 2 limit are observable from the 4 d 2 3 p 0 intermediate whereas only the levels built on the 4 d 2 D 5 / 2 ionization limit are observable when excited from the 4 d 2 3 P 2 intermediate level. The level assignments and the line shapes simulations of the autoionizing resonances have been made using the multichannel quantum defect theory...|$|R
