5|$|Even though Salomy Jane didn't {{return a}} profit (likely due to second-string {{distribution}} channels), its favorable reception convinced Middleton {{that his wife}} could challenge the world's top movie star, Mary Pickford. Every CMPC movie was from that time forward intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> vehicle for Michelena. Unfortunately, Michelena's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill, and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money. Mignon, The Lily of Poverty Flat, A Phyllis of the Sierras, Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit, and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given {{until the end of}} the year to be completed. Faust wasn't done by January 1916, and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy. Faust was never released.|$|E

5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>star.</b> The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E

Bassist Put-Mon (Gary Putman) took over the vocals, assuming the name Gary B.I.B.B. It's Not Unusual featured guest spots by both Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Randy Bachman.|$|E

NGC 2419 is likely in a highly elliptical orbit around the Milky Way. It has a magnitude of 10.3 and is a Shapley class II cluster; this classification indicates that it is extremely concentrated at its center. Originally thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> NGC 2419 was discovered to be a globular cluster by American astronomer Carl Lampland.|$|E

500|$|Shigeru Miyamoto {{mentioned}} in a retrospective interview that, after reviewing content of Dinosaur Planet, the similarities of Rare's anthropomorphic design of Sabre to Nintendo's Fox McCloud design were striking. The title was later changed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Star</b> Fox-brand launch {{game for the}} Nintendo GameCube. According to Tossell, the sudden change was not [...] "accepted willingly by all" [...] of the team as the plot had to be entirely re-written in places to accommodate the Star Fox canon. The updated title was originally named Star Fox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet, but [...] "Dinosaur Planet" [...] was later removed. The team later realised the potential of using the Star Fox licence in hopes of boosting awareness, and decided to switch development from the Nintendo 64 to the upcoming GameCube console. Before the change, Rare released downloadable, limited full length MP3s from the unreleased game—many of which did appear in Star Fox Adventures—to video game websites, along with numerous trailers and screenshots of gameplay.|$|E
500|$|When 20th Century-Fox {{began to}} develop Monroe's star image, they wanted her to replace the aging Betty Grable, who was their most popular [...] "blonde bombshell" [...] of the 1940s. The 1940s had been the heyday of actresses who were {{perceived}} as tough and smart, such as Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, film stars who had appealed to women-dominated audiences. The studio wanted Monroe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>star</b> of the new decade who would draw men to movie theaters. From the beginning, she played a significant part {{in the creation of}} her public image, and towards the end of her career Monroe exerted almost full control over it. Monroe devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as Sidney Skolsky and Louella Parsons, and controlled the use of her images. Besides Grable, she was often compared to another iconic blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow. The comparison was partly prompted by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair.|$|E

Hideous Kinky, a low-budget drama shot before the release of Titanic, was Winslet's sole film release of 1998. She turned down offers to star in Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) to do the film. Based on Esther Freud's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, Hideous Kinky {{tells the story of a}} single British mother yearning for a new life in 1970s Morocco. Writing for The New York Times, the critic Janet Maslin commended Winslet's decision to follow-up Titanic with such an offbeat project, and took note of how well she had captured her character's [...] "obliviousness and optimism".|$|E

Lovato is then shown on the set of a commercial for her perfume, in a pink wig with makeup being applied to her. She is uncomfortable and eventually refuses to cooperate, which angers the director (Smith). The video then cuts back to Rumor Has It with applause from the audience and ends with Beverly praising Lovato.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{released}} her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, {{was released in}} summer 2009 in Europe, {{and later in the}} US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, [...] "I wanted [...] <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>star,</b> and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [...] Black Star won the 2010 Best [...] "Women's Scent Mass" [...] by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).

It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star's [...] "follow your dreams", though the tagline for the new perfume is [...] "Dare to Discover". The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is [...] "Dare to discover more". It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.|$|E
