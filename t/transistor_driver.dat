50|$|The {{physical}} connection is realized as a serial bus with a fixed data rate of 9600 baud. There are just 2 communications signals plus the essential common-ground reference signal. The TX signal goes from the MASTER to every SLAVE device. The RX signal goes from every SLAVE device to the MASTER device. Both signals have pull-ups. The bus is driven at every transmitter by an open collector <b>transistor</b> <b>driver,</b> and isolated at each receiver with an opto-isolator - though cable harnesses carrying the communication signals may also carry 24-volt power and ground signals to devices, meaning the devices {{may not be}} isolated from {{each other as they}} share the same power bus.

Utilization of the p-channel transistor allows eliminating necessity of using of isolated power supply for the driver of the high side transistor.

40|$|The optical {{properties}} of GaAs {{make it a}} very useful material for the fabrication of optical emitters and detectors. GaAs also possesses electronic properties which permit the fabrication of high speed electronic devices which are superior to conventional silicon devices. This thesis describes three examples of the monolithic integration of optical and electronic devices on semi-insulating GaAs substrates. In the first example, an injection laser was integrated with a Gunn oscillator to yield a high frequency modulated optical source. In the second example, an injection laser was integrated with a metal semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET). The transistor was used to modulate the current through the laser. In the third example, an integrated optical repeater was demonstrated which consisted of a MESFET optical detector, a current source, a <b>transistor</b> <b>driver,</b> and an injection laser all fabricated on a single chip. The repeater displayed an optical gain of 10 dB. In order to facilitate the fabrication of more complex integrated optoelectronic circuits, a method was sought to form a laser cavity which did not occupy the entire width of a chip. The result was the demonstration of whispering gallery lasers which take the shape of quarter and half rings. The performance of the curved lasers was reduced {{from that of the}} straight lasers due to optical scattering at imperfections along the curve. A general theory is developed which describes mode conversion in perturbed dielectric resonators. This theory is applied to the case of the whispering gallery laser and its predictions are compared with experiment...|$|E
40|$|Five {{subjects}} {{related to}} monolithic integration of electronic and optical devices in the (AlGa) As material system are treated in this thesis. They are: 1. The Integrated Optoelectronic Repeater: The design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} the first monolithic integrated optical repeater is described. This device consists of an optical detector, electronic gain stage, and current modulated semiconductor laser transmitter integrated in a single crystal chip to perform the function of regenerating an optical signal as might be found in an optical communication system. The device has a measured optical gain (light out to light in) of 10 dB. 2. Ion Implanted Lasers and Schottky Gate Field Effect Transistors: The use of ion implantation as a technique to fabricate both lasers and field effect transistors is described. Devices fabricated include a beryllium implanted laser diode on N type GaAs substrate, a beryllium implanted laser diode on semi-insulating Cr doped GaAs substrate integrated with a field effect <b>transistor</b> <b>driver,</b> and sulfur implanted GaAs field effect transistors. 3. A Steady State Lateral Model of the Double Heterostructure Laser: A theoretical model of the double heterostructure laser is described which treats the p-n junction in the device correctly by using fundamental semiconductor relationships and reasonable assumptions about the device heterointerfaces. The model treats both the electronic and optical properties self consistently, making the model valid above lasing threshold. Finite element formalism is adopted as a solution technique to enable the treatment of complicated diode geometries. An example is treated and theoretical and experimental results are compared. 4. The Effect of Lateral Carrier Diffusion on the Modulation Response of a Semiconductor Laser: The effect of lateral carrier diffusion upon the modulation characteristics of the semiconductor laser is investigated. A self consistent analysis of the spatially dependent rate equations is performed using a finite element model. The transverse junction stripe laser is treated as an example and a comparison is made between lateral carrier diffusion and spontaneous emission as damping mechanisms for the resonance peak. Experimental results bear out {{the conclusion that the}} relaxation resonance in this device is damped mainly by lateral carrier diffusion. In addition, a simple analytic result is presented which illustrates qualitatively the effect of lateral carrier diffusion upon such devices. The conclusion from this result is that lateral carrier diffusion serves to damp the relaxation resonance in the semiconductor laser quite well, but probably will not serve to improve the upper limit on modulation frequency as might have been suspected. 5. Effective Permittivity Formalism and the Design of Buried Heterostructure Lasers: An approach to effective permittivity formalism is presented which clarifies and extends the use of this technique particularly in the treatment of waveguiding in the semiconductor laser. The scalar wave equation is posed in a variational form, and the effective permittivity formalism is treated as a variational approximation technique. This approach shows clearly the nature and limits of the approximation involved. The formalism is applied to the case of the buried heterostructure laser and the results differ considerably from the conventional application of effective permittivity formalism to this device when a reasonable form is assumed for the variational modal profile...|$|E

The power station is a dual source input generating station using 8 series connected 100 A, 12 V batteries per phase as backup, the solar panels being the main frame. An inverter of 12 Volt direct current input voltage was incorporated to supply an output of 3 -phase, 220 Volts and 50 hertz alternating current.

40|$|In {{these days}} {{due to the}} {{information}} technology {{there are many ways}} to control a remote servomotor. In the paper it is shown a simple and reliable way to handle the control and monitoring of a remote stepper motor using a Local Area Network (LAN). The hardware uses a common PIC microcontroller and a stand-alone Ethernet controller. The main program located in the flash program memory solves the following tasks: read packs through SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) from the Ethernet controller's buffer and decode them, encapsulate data to be sent with the Ethernet controller, control the on-off state of the transistors from the static converter and receive feedback directly from the optical sensor to monitor the actual position of the shaft. The microcontroller supervises also the Ethernet controller. The Ethernet controller's job is to receive data from the main application remote program that runs on a computer, via UTP cable. Then it stores the data for a short time in a buffer from which the microcontroller can read it. The microcontroller stores data on this Ethernet controller too and can command it to send data to the main application program running remotely.
