Let us imagine a raven {{flying through the air}} in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that the motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line.

If, after having regulated our watches by the optimal method, we wished to verify the result by means of these new signals, we should observe discrepancies due to the common <b>translatory</b> motion of the two stations. And are such signals inconceivable, if we take the view of Laplace, that universal gravitation is transmitted with a velocity a million times as great as that of light? However, in 1905 Poincaré calculated that changes in the gravitational field can propagate {{with the speed of}} light if it is presupposed that such a theory is based on the Lorentz transformation. He wrote: Laplace showed in effect that the propagation is either instantaneous or much faster than that of light. However, Laplace examined the hypothesis of finite propagation velocity ceteris non mutatis; here, on the contrary, this hypothesis is conjoined with many others, {{and it may be that}} between them a more or less perfect compensation takes place.

Material and Methods. The study was performed on the sample of 185 subjects, their age ranging from 11 to 26 years (X= 14) with early (by the age of 11 years) and late performed extraction of the first permanent molars in the maxilla and mandible and determined class I of occlusal relationship.

40|$|AbstractThe Rapid Sloshing Model {{methodology}} {{developed by}} Godderidge et al. [13], {{is used for}} the simulation of sloshing in longitudinal and transverse cross sections of membrane liquefied natural gas tanks near the critical depth. Sloshing is induced by periodic <b>translatory</b> and rotational tank motions at and near the first resonant period. Subsequently irregular <b>translatory</b> motions obtained with a realistic wave spectrum and simultaneous <b>translatory</b> and rotational motions are applied to the tank cross sections. The validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) methodology from Godderidge et al.

Simulation times are typically 0. 1 % of real time on a desktop PC. A similar level of agreement between Rapid Sloshing Model and CFD solution is observed when an irregular motion profile from a realistic seaway is applied to the tank for a duration corresponding to 35 min on a liquefied natural gas carrier. Compared to an existing phenomenological modelling approach the RSM methodology reduces the error by up to an order of magnitude in sloshing scenarios of practical interest...|$|E
