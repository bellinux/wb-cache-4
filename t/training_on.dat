It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor. For Braham, progress was slow and {{he made his first}} solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction. On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo {{for the first time in}} a Tiger Moth. In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin <b>training</b> <b>on</b> military aircraft.

5|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} the effects of combined NVC and mindfulness <b>training</b> <b>on</b> 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs.

5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure.

5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 {{pilots in}} his class to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF.
