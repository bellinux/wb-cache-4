30|$|In conclusion, {{our results}} {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} systematic difference between coaches and male and female cross-country runner intentions and perceptions of easy, moderate, and hard intensity <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> throughout a competitive season. The rationale for this has not been fully elucidated but may be related to differences in coaching supervision during easy and hard <b>training</b> <b>sessions,</b> physiological and psychosocial factors before, during, and after <b>training</b> <b>sessions,</b> communication between coaches and athletes, and athlete experience. Given the success of the athletes in this study, these results show how a simple system for monitoring training such as the sRPE method may improve control of training variables and provide a useful tool for coaches to evaluate training load placed on athletes on a day-to-day basis, in a simple, responsive way [4, 25]. Future studies should examine the link between perceptions of effort following moderate to hard <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> or following long durations of <b>training</b> <b>sessions.</b>|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the crucial role {{representations}} play in teaching physics, their use is an important aspect of teacher preparation. This study involved three <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> for physics graduate teaching assistants (TAs) that presented different representational tools or strategies targeting important topics that are common in introductory physics courses. The content of the <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> relied on physics education research findings while their design was informed by the framework of pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986 a). Fourteen participants from the Department of Physics and Astronomy attended the <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> as part of a required Teaching of Physics course during the fall of 2007. Data on the TAs' use of representations included pre- and post-assessments, and observations of them while teaching recitations. Four expert physics teachers who did not participate in the <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> served as a contrast group through the completion of the written measures. The data show that the TAs recalled the content of the <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> two to three weeks following the sessions. However, when teaching these topics in their recitations the TAs did not use the representations from the <b>training</b> <b>sessions.</b> They still relied primarily on a narrow selection of well-established representations such as mathematical representations and free body force diagrams. In addition, many did not follow established problem solving steps that were also a part of their training. This minimal impact of the <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> on their teaching is explained in part by the TAs' lack of specialized content knowledge, a type of subject matter knowledge needed for teaching (Ball et al., 2008). Based on the findings of this study, future TA <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> should be designed to explicitly focus on both representational strategies and the specialized content knowledge required to successfully implement the strategies...|$|R

5|$|Ben Arfa {{switched}} to the number 10 shirt for the 2009–10 season and made his debut on the opening match {{day of the season}} in a 2–0 away victory over Grenoble appearing as a substitute in the 68th minute. The following week, he earned his first start of the season against Lille and assisted the winning goal scored by Brandão. Controversy surfaced again, however, when, on 8 October 2009, Ben Arfa was fined €10,000 by the club for missing a <b>training</b> <b>session.</b> Ben Arfa blamed the absence on airport delays as he was in Tunisia visiting family members during the international break. A month later, on 18 November, he got into a heated argument with manager Didier Deschamps during a <b>training</b> <b>session,</b> for which Ben Arfa later apologized. Under Deschamps {{in the first half of}} the season, Ben Arfa appeared in 15 of the club's 20 league matches and only played the full 90 minutes in two matches, a 2–1 defeat against Monaco and a 2–0 defeat to Auxerre.|$|E
