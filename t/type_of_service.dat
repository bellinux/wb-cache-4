5|$|Ofcom awards {{licenses}} for digital radio services differently {{depending on the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and the platform. Ofcom advertises the licences of new digital radio ensembles and are subject to an open competition to the highest bidder. Ensemble licence awards are awarded for twelve years. To broadcast a service on a DAB ensemble, a station must hold a Digital Sound Programme Service licence from Ofcom. On digital television services, individual stations can apply for either a digital cable and satellite licence to broadcast on the aforementioned platforms, or apply for a digital terrestrial licence to broadcast on digital terrestrial television.|$|E
40|$|Though various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{skills and}} {{knowledge}} have been suggested for inclusion in service training programs {{that are designed to}} improve the competence <b>of</b> frontline <b>service</b> providers, there has been no empirical work to investigate the structural relationships among various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> skill. In this study, a total <b>of</b> twelve <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> skill are identified. A measurement model for service skills is developed accordingly and tested with the use <b>of</b> hotel <b>service.</b> The results <b>of</b> confirmatory factor analysis reveal acceptable model fit, suggesting that these twelve <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> skill can be classified into two categories: technical versus functional.

40|$|The session {{initiation}} protocol (SIP) is {{a unifying}} protocol for providing integrated telephony and Internet <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> such as Web, presence, instant messaging, and chat. To {{provide for the}} integration <b>of</b> these disparate <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> considerations must be given from a network point of view. However, {{little attention has been}} given in the literature to identify the network elements required to provide these services or the mechanisms for integrating these different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for end users. This paper describes a network-level services architecture for SIP, including network functions and entities needed to support the services integration. We will discuss how services can be incorporated at different levels in the network, and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> typically created at each of these levels. We will also describe a service access and mediation function, which blends disparate <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in creating a seamless and rewarding user experience. © 2002 Lucent Technologies Inc...|$|R

5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 35 - 50) The {{purposes of}} this study were to determine if there were ethnic differences in: (a) whether or not services were sought for mental health, (b) <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> sought for mental health, (c) satisfaction with the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> sought for mental health, (d) reasons for not seeking help, (e) <b>types</b> <b>of</b> suicide-related behaviors, (f) <b>types</b> <b>of</b> help sought for suicide-related behaviors, (g) satisfaction with the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> sought for suicide-related behaviors, and (h) reasons for not seeking help for suicide-related behaviors. This study performed a secondary data analysis of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. A series of cross tabulations was conducted to examine differences in rates <b>of</b> <b>service</b> use, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> used, reasons for not seeking <b>services,</b> and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> suicide-related behaviors. Univariate analyses of variance with Tukey pairwise comparisons were conducted to examine satisfaction. Results indicated that there were significant differences: (a) between ethnic groups in rates <b>of</b> <b>service</b> use, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> sought, reasons for not seeking <b>services,</b> and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> suicide-related behaviors reported; and (b) between Hispanics and Blacks and Whites in satisfaction ratings for medical doctors, and between Hispanics and Whites for psychologists. Results also indicated that there were significant differences between respondents with no suicidal ideation, ideation, and attempts in: (a) service use among Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites; (b) <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> sought among Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites; and (c) satisfaction ratings for medical doctors among Asians and religious or spiritual advisors among Blacks.

Regular Force officers were not eligible for any long service awards since, as they held a commission, {{they were expected to}} serve honourably and {{for a long period of}} time. Reserve Force officers were eligible for various long service decorations that granted them the use of post-nominal letters, while Reserve Force other ranks were eligible for various long service and good conduct medals, but without post-nominals.|$|E
25|$|Some organizations, such as hospitals, {{often provide}} a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> such as neonatal, while leaving others {{to provide the}} balance of services. How the service is {{actually}} provided, {{and the level of}} service that is provided, can vary from a region to another, although basic standards are quite the same. Emergency service in Italy is always free of charge. Air ambulance services are normally provided by the same regional authorities with a network of dedicated helicopters, or as an added service from a number of other government agencies, including the Italian Coast Guard, Civil Defence, and the Vigili del Fuoco (firefighters).|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand {{a filling}} station is often {{referred}} to as a service station, garage, or petrol station, even though the filling station may not offer mechanical repairs or assistance with dispensing fuel. Levels of service available include full service, for which assistance in dispensing fuel is offered, as well as offers to check tyre pressure or clean vehicle windscreens. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> is becoming uncommon in New Zealand, particularly Auckland. Further south of Auckland, many filling stations offer full service. There is also help service or assisted service, for which customers must request assistance before it is given, and self-service, for which no assistance is available.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E
25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} meant that working mothers needed access to childcare. In anticipation of mothers in {{the workforce}}, the Federal Minister of Labour was empowered to enter into agreements {{for the establishment of}} daycare facilities for the children of mothers working in war industries. From 1942 to 1946, the Dominion-Provincial Wartime Agreement allowed for subsidized day nursery care for mothers working in essential wartime industries. Provinces that were most industrialized, such as Ontario and Quebec, saw a growing demand for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and took advantage of this agreement to establish their own standards and regulations. This program provided aid to mothers working in war industries; however, it placed strict limitations similar services for women with young children in other work sectors. These wartime day nurseries boasted organized play, frequent outings and other features that would become early childhood education. In June 1946, with the war in Europe over, Federal funding for day nurseries was pulled and the majority of day nurseries were closed. However, some municipalities continued offering day care services and made up the shortfall.|$|E
500|$|Puck {{has been}} granted early release from {{juvenile}} detention {{on the condition}} that he performs community service. He picks Artie Abrams, a paraplegic, to fulfill that service, and the two busk in the school courtyard. They sing a duet of [...] "One Love/People Get Ready" [...] while Puck surreptitiously intimidates their schoolmates into giving donations. He then helps Artie get back together with Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), by setting up a double date with them and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera). Puck's caseworker Joan Martin (Michael Hyatt) had believed he was working to rehabilitate gang members, and tells him he will have to return to the detention center unless he finds an alternative <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Puck admits to Artie that despite his bravado, he was miserable when locked up and does not want to return; Artie convinces him to complete the required real community service and offers to tutor him in school.|$|E
