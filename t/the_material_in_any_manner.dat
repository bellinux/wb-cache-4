40|$|Abstract: A multiple-pass tube-drawing {{process is}} often used to obtain large {{cross-sectional}} reductions in tubular components. For a multi-pass drawing process, it is important to distribute the strains among the individual passes. With even distribution of the strains, there is less chance to exceed the formability limit of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> one pass, thus preventing defects such as drawing cracks from occurring. In the present study, an analytical model is developed, which determines the appropriate intermediate tube geometry to ensure uniform strain distributions for a two-pass drawing process. The model is based on the evaluation of the cross-sectional changes of the tube after each pass. For a desired product geometry, the model provides the intermediate diameter and intermediate thickness that should be used to distribute evenly the drawing strains between the two passes. Finite element modelling of the two-pass tube-drawing process confirms the viability and validity of the analytical model. The model has also been used to develop criteria curves for various limit strains. These criteria curves can be used to determine whether the tube will fail or will be successfully drawn in a two-pass process...|$|R

Collaboration scripts can help learners to engage in argumentation and knowledge acquisition. However, they might have differential effects for learners holding differently structured knowledge (internal scripts) on argumentation. We investigated how external scripts interact with learners' internal scripts concerning collaborative argumentation. 98 students from two secondary schools participated. Two versions of an external collaboration script (high vs. low structured) supporting argumentation were embedded within a web-based collaborative inquiry curriculum. Students' internal scripts were classified as either high or low structured, establishing a 2 x 2 -factorial design. Results suggest that the high structured external script supported all learners, regardless of their internal scripts, concerning the acquisition of domain-general knowledge. Learners' internal scripts influenced the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge. Results from two case studies reveal differences in argumentation processes attributable to the learners' internal scripts.

Working with the wave equation in mixed rather than irreducible form allows one to directly account for both, the acoustic pressure field and the acoustic particle velocity field. Indeed, this becomes the natural option in many problems, such as those involving waves propagating in moving domains, because the equations can easily be set in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) frame of reference. Yet, when attempting a standard Galerkin finite element solution (FEM) for them, {{it turns out that}} an inf-sup compatibility constraint has to be satisfied, which prevents from using equal interpolations for the approximated acoustic pressure and velocity fields. In this work it is proposed to resort to a subgrid scale stabilization strategy to circumvent this condition and thus facilitate code implementation.

International audienceThulung Rai, an endangered Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Eastern Nepal, presents two derivational suffixes associated with reflexivization:-si and-s. The first,-si, is quite productive, found in complete paradigms, and derives reflexives, reciprocals, antipassives and anticausatives from transitive verbs (and occasionally from intransitive verbs). The second marker,-s, {{is more difficult to}} analyze: it has a limited distribution in verb paradigms, only appearing with 1 PI and 3 SG forms, and appears {{in a number of different}} contexts: it is found with the same types of derivations as-si but also-in some cases obligatorily, in others optionally-with verbs that do not have reflexive (or related) functions. It is even found with some transitive verbs. In this presentation, I will propose an analysis of the phenomena above based on elicited and narrative data I have collected in the field. The-s in fact has multiple, albeit related, origins: it is a phonological reduction of-si in certain circumstances, while in others it appears to be an older reflexivizing suffix which has been integrated, to different degrees, into verb morphology. With transitives, it appears to be a trace reflecting the complex derivational history of verbs which are derived from intransitives...|$|R

This article focuses on Gandhi’s use of Biblical metaphor in the English translation of his autobiography “The Story of My Experiments with Truth” (1940). The aim of the analysis is to show how Gandhi appropriated Christian ideology to his own life story when presenting it to an English-speaking audience. Given that metaphor use is “seldom neutral” (Semino, 2008, p. 32), underlying conceptual mappings can be revealing, particularly when the same conceptual frame is employed systematically across a text or discourse situation. Analysis of the English translation reveals a use of Biblical metaphor in the English translation which may constitute a deliberate appropriation of Christian ideology. This article suggests potential motivations for this appropriation, linking the text’s metaphor use to Gandhi’s desire to reform Hinduism and intention to counter {{the rising tide of}} Hindu-Christian conversion that threatened the success of his campaign for Indian political and spiritual independence.

Sixty-four (64) university students participated in the study. Results showed that learning partners converged strongly with respect to their use of resources during the collaboration process. Convergence with respect to outcomes was rather low, but relatively higher for application-oriented knowledge than for factual knowledge. With content-specific external representation, learners used more appropriate knowledge resources without sharing more knowledge after collaboration. Learners in the computer-mediated collaboration used a wider range of resources. Moreover, in exploratory qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study found evidence for a relation between aspects of the collaborative process and knowledge convergence...|$|R

The aim of this study was to identity the types of physical activity narratives drawn upon by active spinal injured people. More than 50 h of semi-structured life-story interview data, collected as part of larger interdisciplinary program of disability lifestyle research, was analysed for 30 physically active male and female spinal cord injury (SCI) participants. A structural narrative analysis of data identified three narrative types which people with SCI draw on: (1) exercise is restitution, (2) exercise is medicine, and (3) exercise is progressive redemption. These insights contribute new knowledge by adding a unique narrative perspective to existing cognitive understanding of physical activity behaviour in the spinal cord injured population. The implications of this narrative typology for developing effective positive behavioural change interventions are critically discussed. It is concluded that the identified narratives types may be constitutive, as well as reflective, of physical activity experiences and therefore may be a useful tool on which to base physical activity promotion initiatives...|$|R

The model uses a stress-block approach to represent the stresses that develop at a cracked section by three discrete stress zones: (a) a compressive zone; (b) an uncracked tensile zone; and (c) a cracked tensile zone. It is further shown that the stress-block, and hence flexural behaviour, is a function of five principal parameters: compressive stress–strain relation; tensile stress–strain relation; fibre pull-out behaviour; the number and distribution of fibres across the cracked section in terms of their positions, orientations and embedment lengths; and the strain/crack-width profile in relation to the deflection of the beam. An experimental investigation was undertaken on both cast and sprayed specimens to obtain relationships for use in the model. The results of the study showed a reasonable agreement between the model predictions and experimental results.

But misunderstandings can also be seen as getting interactants out of (as well as into) trouble. For example, misunderstandings may be produced to deal with disaffiliative implications of ‘not being on the same page,’ and as such they may be deployed as a resource for avoiding trouble. This paper examines misunderstanding as a pragmatic accomplishment, focusing on the uses to which it is put in interactions as a practice for dealing with threats to intersubjectivity: the extent to which persons are aligned in terms of a current referent, activity, assessment, etc. A multimodal discourse analysis of audio and video recordings of naturally-occurring talk inspects moments in which misunderstandings are purported or displayed (rather than overtly invoked) as well as how such misunderstandings are oriented to as simply-repairable references, versus inferential matters more misaligned and potentially fraught. Rather than being a straightforward reflection of an experience of trouble with understanding, misunderstanding may also be collaboratively produced to manage practical challenges to intersubjectivity...|$|R

This article addresses how the introduction of a more product-oriented curriculum in Norway has challenged and altered more traditional ideas of teacher autonomy. Based on interview data, the study investigates prominent perspectives on autonomy through an analysis of how teachers, principals, a district superintendent and educational administrators perceive the current steering and control through the national curriculum. The findings show three main perspectives on teacher autonomy as (1) pedagogical freedom and absence of control, (2) the will and capacity to justify practices and (3) a local responsibility. However, these varying viewpoints are contested and highlight the multidimensionality of teacher autonomy. These should be discussed in relation to one another for an increased understanding of the associated and current dilemmas arising in the teaching profession with the shifts in curriculum control. The findings also shed light on how an increase in local responsibilities related to student outcomes and school development interferes in the unofficial contract that has historically existed between teachers and the state...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{a number of}} issues associated with the problem of calculating contributions from the electromagnetic quantum induced energy and stress <b>in</b> a stationary <b>material</b> with an inhomogeneous polarizability. After briefly reviewing the conventional approaches developed by Lifshitz el al and more recent attempts by others, we emphasize the need to accommodate the effects due to the classical constitutive properties of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> experimental attempt to detect such contributions. Attention is then concentrated on a particular system composed of an ENZ-type (epsilon-near-zero) meta-material, chosen to have an anisotropic and inhomogeneous permittivity confined in an infinitely long perfectly conducting open waveguide. This permits us to deduce from the source-free Maxwell's equations a complete set of harmonic electromagnetic evanescent eigen-modes and eigen-frequencies. Since these solutions prohibit the existence of asymptotic scattering states in the guide an alternative regularization scheme, based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula, enables us to prescribe precise criteria for the extraction of finite quantum expectation values from regularized mode sums together with error bounds on these values. This scheme is used to derive analytic results for regularized energy densities in the guide. The criteria are exploited to construct a numerical scheme that is bench-marked by comparing its output with the analytic results derived from the special properties of the inhomogeneous ENZ medium.

It is suggestive that academia, to probably a large extent, fail to bring such resourceful people to positions were their talents really can make a difference, for instance in research.

An Architectural Research Centres Consortium publication. The discussion about the legitimacy of architecture being an autonomous discipline or a part of an interrelated system of areas of knowledge has been long discussed[i]. This article connects the scenario described by Fraser[ii] and Wigley[iii] where architecture needs to be considered in an expanded field as consequence of the post-critical period, to the work of a new generation of architects whose interest lies on questions that are peripheral to architecture sensu stricto. The type of architecture that emerges in this scenario is characterised by a proclivity towards other disciplines, including politics, economics and social studies. The article presents a series of examples of recent projects and discusses the impact of their approach to architecture. As a conclusion, this paper proposes the notion of mediocritas to establish a right balance between architecture as an autonomous discipline and its contamination with other cultural fields...|$|R
