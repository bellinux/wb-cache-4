5|$|Speed Racer is an 18-year-old {{whose life}} and love has always been {{automobile}} racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, mechanic Sparky, and girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible), a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother's cars, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, but remains primarily interested {{in the art of}} the race and the well-being of his family.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of Wednesday, August 11, 1965, 21-year-old Marquette Frye, an African American man behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother's 1955 Buick, was pulled over for {{reckless}} driving by California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer Lee Minikus. After administering a field sobriety test, Minikus placed Frye under arrest and radioed for his vehicle to be impounded.

25|$|Gorshin's slender {{athletic}} build, wide mouth, {{and pale}} eyes under strong brows were ideal characteristics for screen henchmen.

He {{was on his way}} to a Hollywood screen test for the role of Petty Officer Ruby in Run Silent, Run Deep.

25|$|Many {{people believe}} that Benny appears behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Maxwell in the 1963 film It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, {{but in fact it}} was a 1932 Cadillac.] The long shots for the scene were shot months before Benny was cast—with a stunt driver at the wheel—and the role was {{intended}} for Stan Laurel (which is why the character wears a derby, which Jack almost never did). When Laurel ultimately passed on appearing, Jack agreed to play it. According to the commentary on the Criterion edition of the film, his close-ups were filmed on a rear-projection stage at the Paramount studio.|$|E

25|$|His first WRC {{event was}} the 1987 Swedish Rally behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Nova, and again two years later, driving the Sierra and {{finishing}} 15th overall. Later that year, he finished 5th overall at Rally New Zealand in a {{rear wheel drive}} Sierra Cosworth. By 1990 McRae was driving a Sierra Cosworth 4x4 and achieved sixth place in that year's RAC Rally, despite several accidents. 1991 saw McRae turn professional as he was signed by Prodrive boss David Richards to his Subaru team in the British Rally Championship for an annual wage of approximately £10,000. McRae was British Rally Champion in both 1991 and 1992, soon graduating to the Subaru factory team at World Rally Championship level. 1992 also saw Colin McRae make his début in the British Touring Car Championship, with a one-off appearance for the Prodrive-run BMW factory team at the Knockhill round. In {{the second of the}} two races of the event, McRae collided with Matt Neal. Race officials found McRae to have caused an avoidable collision and subsequently disqualified him.|$|E
25|$|Sonya and Toadie undergo {{fertility}} {{tests and}} Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) tells them that Toadie {{has a low}} sperm count. After almost giving up {{on the idea of}} having a baby, Sonya takes a standard pregnancy test before donating blood, and Rhys tells her she is pregnant. Troy returns to town and moves next door to Sonya and Toadie. He tries to gain custody of Callum and takes an intervention order out on Toadie, causing Sonya to collapse from the stress. When Troy refuses to let Callum leave his house, Sonya and Jade force their way in and Troy locks them inside. When Sonya and Jade escape, Troy falls and sustains a head injury. After he discharges himself from hospital, Troy goes to Callum's school and is confronted by Sonya and Toadie. Troy leaves, but falls unconscious at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> truck and dies. Toadie's cousin, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), moves in and bonds with Sonya over the baby. Toadie proposes to Sonya and she accepts. Sonya goes into labour two weeks early and due to complications, she has to be rushed to hospital, where she gives birth to Nell (Scarlett Anderson) via caesarean section. Sonya undergoes surgery for internal bleeding, before she is reunited with her daughter.|$|E
500|$|Shortly thereafter, Cavendish lost <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{lead-out}} man Mark Renshaw after {{struggling to}} come back after the crash which hindered his lead-out train. There were two technical turns before the finish line. Peter Sagan was sitting in third wheel of his team's train; he negotiated the final 90 degree corner with 200 m to go and profited from an unintentional lead-out by Jurgen Roelandts (...) , who had opened his sprint before Sagan outpowered him in the last hundred meters to win the day. It was Sagan's eleventh victory in Tour de Suisse history, equaling the records of Hugo Koblet and Ferdi Kubler. Because of a split in the peloton, Pinot lost five seconds to general classification rival Geraint Thomas of Team Sky.|$|E

500|$|Voeckler {{crossed the}} summit of the climb first, taking the 25 points on offer for the hors catégorie climb. The peloton crossed five-and-a-half minutes later. Voeckler also took maximum points at the Col de Richemond, and as a result, took the polka-dot jersey for the {{mountains}} classification lead from [...] rider Fredrik Kessiakoff. Sagan had dropped back to aid his teammate Vincenzo Nibali, who had attacked on the descent of the Col du Grand Colombier, but both riders were not to stay in front ahead of the -led peloton. 's Jens Voigt made up a minute on the lead quartet to join them, with around [...] remaining; Devenyns looked to go clear in the closing stages, but Voeckler had kept most in hand to take his third career Tour stage victory, three seconds ahead of Scarponi and seven ahead of Voigt.

500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider can muster on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to try to set up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti never had much of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second day in a row, Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> leadout man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early leadout left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able to come around the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Mullin leader Patrick Nee, Paul McGonagle was {{thoroughly}} livid over {{the murder of}} his brother and, believing that O'Sullivan was responsible, received permission to kill him. On March 28, 1971, after having dinner with his wife at Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant, O'Sullivan dropped his wife off at their home and told her that he had an errand to do and that he would be back in an hour. Shortly after midnight, Mary noticed that his car was parked in the driveway in front of their house at the bottom of their driveway, it was surrounded by a group of neighbors. She went out to see what her neighbors were looking at and she saw her husband's bullet riddled body. She at first did not recognize his body but made positive identification from the suit that he wore. O'Sullivan had been shot by several gunmen numerous times as he sat behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and was hanging half out of the car with the driver's door open.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, Chapman progressed {{through the}} motor racing formulae, {{designing}} {{and building a}} series of racing cars, sometimes {{to the point of}} maintaining limited production as they were so successful and highly sought after, until he arrived in Formula One. Besides his engineering work, he also piloted a Vanwall F1-car in 1956 but crashed into his teammate Mike Hawthorn during practice for the French Grand Prix at Reims, ending his career as a race driver and focusing him on the technical side. Along with John Cooper, he revolutionised the premier motor sport. Their small, lightweight mid-engined vehicles gave away much in terms of power, but superior handling meant their competing cars often beat the all-conquering front engined Ferraris and Maseratis. Eventually, with driver Jim Clark at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> race cars, Team Lotus appeared as though they could win whenever they pleased. With Clark driving the Lotus 25, Team Lotus won its first F1 World Championship in 1963. It was Clark, driving a Lotus 38 at the Indianapolis 500 in 1965, who drove the first ever mid-engined car to victory at the [...] "Brickyard". [...] Clark and Chapman became particularly close and Clark's death in 1968 devastated Chapman, who publicly stated that he had lost his best friend.|$|E
2500|$|The RUC at Forkhill {{received}} an emergency call at 3.45 pm reporting {{that there were}} two dead men on the Edenappa Road. Police arrived on the scene at 3.54 pm, where they found Breen lying dead on the roadside; alongside the body was his pen, his glasses and the white handkerchief that he had been carrying. His wallet, warrant card and pager were missing. Buchanan's body was behind <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car, with his seatbelt still fastened. Although the crime scene was cordoned off, the police were unable to remove the bodies or inspect the area due to a sudden snowstorm, therefore the bodies were not taken away until the following morning after they had been checked for booby-trap bombs. When the security forces inspected the scene, they found Kleenex tissue and a Lucozade bottle, but later forensic tests on the items did not find any fingerprints or saliva. Ballistic testing showed that the weapons used in the attack were two [...]223 Armalite rifles, one Ruger Mini-14 and a 7.62 Short rifle. A total of 25 rounds had been fired in the attack, 11 of the bullets had struck the car's front windscreen. One of the Armalites had last been used in a helicopter attack at Silverbridge on 23 June 1988 and the other Armalite had been used in the killing of alleged Garda informer Eamonn Maguire on 1 September 1987 at Cullaville. The other two guns were [...] "clean" [...] weapons.|$|E
