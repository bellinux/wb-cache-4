The GCWDA Bayport facility treats approximately 30 mgd of industrial waste received from approximately 65 customers (primarily petrochemical). Field tests consisted of operating online TOC analyzers at the influent of the Bayport facility in which TOC concentrations can range from 490 to 1020 mg/L {{with an average of}} 870 mg/L. GCWDA conducts approximately 102 TOC analyses in their laboratory per day at their Bayport treatment facility and use TOC measurements for process control and billing purposes. GCWDA plans to use online TOC analyzers for process control, detecting influent slug loads from industries and to potentially use online TOC analyzers to detect and monitor volatiles of the incoming stream. Field tests were conducted for a period of 90-days and used laboratory conformance measurements once per day to compare with analyzer output to demonstrate the instrument's overall accuracy when subjected to many simultaneously changing parameters as experienced in real-time monitoring conditions. Field test results can provide information regarding instrument design, operation and maintenance requirements which influence the performance of the instruments in field applications. The field test report includes evaluations of online TOC analyzers utilizing the following technologies: High Temperature Combustion (HTC), High Temperature Catalytic/Combustion Oxidation (HTCO), Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO), and Two-Stage Advanced Oxidation (TSAO).|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with family-based studies of association between genetic markers and binary traits. A special point of interest in family-based association studies is to separate the within family correlation and the genetic effect common among all families in the study. In family-based studies of quantitative traits within family trait correlation is explicitly modeled {{in terms of both}} alleles shared identical by descent and common environment. We have extended this notion to a binary trait setting, and formulate a generalized linear mixed model based on a log-log link and gamma distributed random effects capturing the within family correlation induced by linkage. The genetic effect common among all families is captured in the linear predictor of the model. We show that the model can be used to construct tests for a variety of situations; for <b>testing</b> <b>association</b> between single markers and a trait, for <b>testing</b> <b>association</b> between multiple markers (jointly) and a trait, and for <b>testing</b> <b>association</b> between a single marker and two diseases jointly.

40|$|Case-control <b>tests</b> for <b>association</b> are an {{important}} tool for mapping complex-trait genes.

In this review article we describe a series of approaches published over the past 2 years which use multilocus genotype data to enable valid case-control <b>tests</b> of <b>association,</b> even in the presence of population structure.

"Genomic control" methods use the independent marker loci to adjust the distribution of a standard test statistic, while "structured association" methods infer the details of population structure en route to <b>testing</b> for <b>association.</b> We discuss the statistical issues involved in the different approaches and present results from simulations comparing the relative performance of the methods under a range of models...|$|R
