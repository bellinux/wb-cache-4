6000|$|... "But then, {{in a short}} time, {{you would}} get tired of looking at them; you would become satiated, and would in fact spoil the whole {{pleasure}} by attempting to enjoy it too fast. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would perhaps do you good." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If {{someone would}} rather {{sit in the}} {{reserves}} at a big club and drive around in a Ferrari rather than going out on-loan and playing, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a sad day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{know better}} how we stand {{when we get}} the new {{machines}} to work. <b>Then,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> pretty safe, I'll buy some shares for Helen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to me {{tomorrow}} evening, {{but you must}} not expect that I shall {{be able to answer}} you <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> must <b>think</b> <b>it</b> over, and make enquiries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{returned}} Staniford lightly, [...] "so do I; but it's for {{a different}} reason, I'm afraid. I should like such a voyage as this to go on forever. Now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will; it seems always to have gone on. Can you remember when it began?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a fresh one. I cut it lately. See how bright it is!" [...] she said, laying {{it against}} the white {{background}} of Romola's fingers. [...] "They get dim, and then he lets me cut another when his hair is grown; and I put it with the Breve, because sometimes he is away a long while, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> helps {{to take care of}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|That is how I {{think and}} feel in this matter, {{but if a}} man sees the matter more gravely, if his {{conscience}} tells him relentlessly and uncompromisingly, [...] "this is a lie," [...] then it is a lie and he must not be guilty of it. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> ill becomes him to be silently excluded. His work is to clamour against {{the existence of the}} barrier that wastes him.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{one has to}} try to be as {{accurate}} as possible. You have to wear the right clothes, and in my case I wore a white wig, because I'm playing her as a mature Queen rather than when she was a younger woman. So you try and get the externals {{as accurate}} as possible, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> like any acting challenge, you just try to play the situation as truthfully as you can. So you play the spirit of the thing rather than the documentary reality of it.|$|R
500|$|On 9 January 2015, Annie Mac played [...] "Living for Love" [...] on Radio 1 {{during her}} evening dance show. In a later {{interview}} with The Independent, Mac {{said that her}} mission was to [...] "represent the landscape of new music honestly", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. [...] "I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> {{going to be all}} right to play it", Mac concluded.|$|R
5000|$|Hopper {{has worked}} closely with {{director}} Clint Eastwood for more than 20 years on films. According to Hopper she typically spends several months collecting vintage items and recreating period clothes from photographs. It {{is all part of}} her minimalist philosophy towards costuming. Hopper stated, [...] "With the work that I do with Clint, his movies are basically everyday life, so the costumes that I deal with are everyday clothes. The costumes, in a way, have to be invisible. If they show <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of distracting. It should be more about the story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{may as well}} stop here, Bull. It will {{be light}} enough to see across the river in another quarter of an hour, {{and if there are}} no boats coming <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is pretty certain that they will not begin until to-morrow night. The peasant said that they have only got 10,000 troops there as yet, and we know that Soult has more than double that, and he may wait another day for them all to come up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 25: If the [...] "rice-grain" [...] {{appearance}} is thus {{produced by the}} tops of the ascending currents (and M. Faye accepts this interpretation), <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> excludes M. Faye's hypothesis that the Sun is gaseous throughout. The comparative smallness of the light-giving spots and their comparative uniformity of size, show us that they have ascended through a stratum of but moderate depth (say 10,000 miles), and that this stratum has a definite lower limit. This favours the hypothesis of a molten shell.] ...|$|E
60|$|But if my design {{be to make}} mankind better, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is my duty, {{at least}} I am sure it is the {{interest}} of those very courts and ministers, whose follies or vices I ridicule, to reward me for my good intentions; for, if it be reckoned a high point of wisdom to get the laughers on our side, {{it is much more}} easy, as well as wise to get those on our side, who can make millions laugh when they please.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh! <b>then</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{is worth}} while {{for me to}} go,' said Theodora. 'I am much obliged to John, but I should only {{interfere}} with his course of education.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now, as I before hinted, I have no {{objection}} to any person's religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.|$|E
6000|$|If, however, {{there be}} truly other people, {{with their own}} world under their feet, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{is fair to say}} that we all have our {{infinite}} identity in the sun. That in the rush and swirl of death we pass through fiery ways to the same sun. And from the sun, can the spores of souls pass to the various worlds? And to the worlds of the cosmos seed across space, through the wild beams of the sun? Is there seed of Mars in my veins? And is astrology not altogether nonsense? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's not a {{doubt of}} it!" [...] I {{returned}} warmly, glad {{to find that}} with Edra it was all plain sailing. [...] "It must be patent to every one that women have far quicker, finer intellects than men, although their brains are smaller; but then quality {{is more important than}} mere quantity. And yet," [...] I continued, [...] "some people hold that women ought not to have the franchise, or suffrage, or whatever it is! Not that I care two straws about the question myself, and I only hope they'll never get it; but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is so illogical--don't you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Neumann, a {{philosophy}} professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario {{expressed support for}} the boycott. Neumann stated that [...] "If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will do some good, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> reasonable and perhaps justified." [...] He argued that a boycott is not anti-semitic, stating that [...] "It targets Israeli, not Jewish, professors." [...] He further stated that [...] "People may always have bad motives underlying good motives. And it's not absolutely impossible {{that some of these}} people have anti-Semitic feelings deep down, but do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that plays a large part? No, I certainly do not." ...|$|R
5000|$|Producer Roberto Orci {{responded in}} Entertainment Weekly in March {{that he was}} not aware of Card's views when he took on {{development}} of the film adaptation. He said that [...] "the movie should be judged on its message, not the personal beliefs of the original author", who had minimal involvement in the film. Orci also stated that [...] "if it's on the screen, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> fair game." [...] Lions Gate Entertainment released a statement stating that [...] "we obviously do not agree with the personal views of Orson Scott Card", while highlighting the company's longtime support of the LGBT community.|$|R
6000|$|... "That way," [...] {{and the old}} basket-maker {{pointed up}} the brook. [...] "Walked right in the water, too. I was going to follow him at first but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was any use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But there's a difference," [...] said Myrtle, earnestly. [...] "I {{know the}} daybreak {{in the city}} very well, for nearly all my life I have had to rise in the dark {{in order to get}} my breakfast and be at work on time. It is {{different}} from this, I assure you; especially in winter, when the chill strikes through to your bones. Even in summer time the air of the city is overheated and close, and the early mornings cheerless and uncomfortable. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is best to stay in bed as long as you can--if you have nothing else to do. But here, out in the open, it seems a shame not to be up with the birds to breathe the scent of the fields and watch the sun send his heralds ahead of him to proclaim his coming and then climb from the bottomless pit into the sky and take possession of it." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{think there}} is a limit, and a highly {{legitimate}} limit, to this process. I think a man may praise Pindar without knowing the top of a Greek letter from the bottom. But I think that if a man is going to abuse Pindar, if he is going to denounce, refute, and utterly expose Pindar, if he is going to show Pindar up as the utter ignoramus and outrageous impostor that he is, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be just as well perhaps--I think, at any rate, it would do no harm--if he did know a little Greek, and even had read a little Pindar. And I think the same situation would be involved if the critic were concerned to point out that Pindar was scandalously immoral, pestilently cynical, or low and beastly in his views of life. When people brought such attacks against the morality of Pindar, I should regret that they could not read Greek; and when they bring such attacks against the morality of Fielding, I regret very much that they cannot read English.|$|E
60|$|We {{have that}} to start upon, and {{consequently}} {{have been able}} to discuss in a very frank and friendly manner all sorts of questions. We have witnessed the spectacle of the British Minister in charge of the trade of this country defending at length and in detail the fiscal system--the purely domestic, internal fiscal system of this country--from very severe, though perfectly friendly and courteous criticism {{on the part of the}} other self-governing communities. If that fund of goodwill to which I have referred had been lacking, if ever a Conference had been called together when there was an actual anti-colonial party in existence, when there was really a deep hatred in the minds of a large portion of the people of this country against the Colonies and against taxation which was imposed at the request or desire of the Colonies, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is quite possible that a Conference such as this would not pass off in the smooth and friendly manner in which this has passed off.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It don't {{look much}} like my writing, sir,' he said at last. 'That is to say,' he added, by way of elucidating the matter, 'it does look like my writing, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2009, Neumann {{expressed}} {{support for}} a proposed resolution by Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) to ban Israeli professors from working in Ontario Universities. Neumann stated that [...] "If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will do some good, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> reasonable and perhaps justified."

5000|$|In 2009, Bob Rivers' Cessna 182 {{was stolen}} from the airport at which it was based by Colton Harris-Moore, who flew it to Yakima, Washington, landed the plane {{excessively}} hard and then fled the scene. The Cessna was declared a write-off by Rivers' insurance company. Rivers publicly condemned the theft and decried Harris-Moore's legend status, telling a news reporter, [...] "I'm {{not a fan of}} the media frenzy because I don't like the whole cult hero thing, but if keeping it alive helps solve <b>it,</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> worth it." [...] He said on the radio, [...] "I don't buy this folk-hero stuff. I was furious that something like this could happen. I really want him caught." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{is always}} an augury to be taken of what a peace {{is likely to be}} from the {{preliminary}} steps that are made to bring it about. We may gather something from the time in which the first overtures are made, from the quarter whence they come, from {{the manner in which they}} are received. These discover the temper of the parties. If your enemy offers peace in the moment of success, it indicates that he is satisfied with something. It shows that there are limits to his ambition or his resentment. If he offers nothing under misfortune, it is probable that it is more painful to him to abandon the prospect of advantage than to endure calamity. If he rejects solicitation, and will not give even a nod to the suppliants for peace, until a change in the fortune of the war threatens him with ruin, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> evident that he wishes nothing more than to disarm his adversary to gain time. Afterwards a question arises, Which of the parties is likely to obtain the greater advantages by continuing disarmed and by the use of time? ...|$|E

Besides, their cough is very bad--the dry cough that makes strong men swear and weak men cry. But they go on. Every day they go on. Never do they rest the dogs. Always do they buy new dogs. At every camp, at every post, at every Indian village, do they cut out the tired dogs and put in fresh dogs. They have much money, money without end, and like water they spend it. They are crazy? Sometimes I think so, for there is a devil in them that drives them on and on, always on. What is it that they try to find? It is not gold. Never do they dig in the ground. I think a long time. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a man they try to find. But what man? Never do we see the man. Yet are they like wolves on the trail of the kill. But they are funny wolves, soft wolves, baby wolves who do not understand the way of the trail. They cry aloud in their sleep at night. In their sleep they moan and groan with the pain of their weariness. And in the day, as they stagger along the trail, they cry under their breaths. They are funny wolves.|$|E
6000|$|Manston {{introduced}} into his method {{a system of}} bewitching flattery, everywhere pervasive, yet, too, so transitory and intangible, that, {{as in the case}} of the poet Wordsworth and the Wandering Voice, though she felt it present, she could never find it. As a foil to heighten its effect, he occasionally spoke philosophically of the evanescence of female beauty--the worthlessness of mere appearance. 'Handsome is that handsome does' he considered a proverb which should be written on the looking-glass of every woman in the land. 'Your form, your motions, your heart have won me,' he said, in a tone of playful sadness. 'They are beautiful. But I see these things, and it comes into my mind that they are doomed, they are gliding to nothing as I look. Poor eyes, poor mouth, poor face, poor maiden! [...] "Where will her glories be in twenty years?" [...] I say. [...] "Where will all of her be in a hundred?" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is cruel that you should bloom a day, and fade for ever and ever. It seems hard and sad that you will die as ordinarily as I, and be buried; be food for roots and worms, be forgotten and come to earth, and grow up a mere blade of churchyard-grass and an ivy leaf. Then, Miss Graye, when I see you are a Lovely Nothing, I pity you, and the love I feel then is better and sounder, larger and more lasting than that I felt at the beginning.' Again an ardent flash of his handsome eyes.|$|E
