500|$|The Dark Knight was {{nominated}} for eight Academy Awards for the 81st Ceremony, breaking the previous record of seven held by Dick Tracy for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip, or graphic novel. The Dark Knight won two awards: Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger and Best Sound Editing. It was additionally nominated for six others, these being Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Film Editing. Heath Ledger was the first posthumous winner of the Best Supporting Actor award, and only the second posthumous acting winner ever (Peter Finch posthumously won the Best Actor award for his performance in the 1976 film Network). In addition, Ledger's win marked the first win {{in any of the}} major Oscar categories (producing, directing, acting, or writing) for a superhero-based film. Notably, Richard King's win in the Sound Editing category blocked a complete awards sweep of the evening by the eventual Best Picture winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Although it did not receive a Best Picture nomination, the show's opening song paid homage to The Dark Knight along with the five Best Picture nominees, including host Hugh Jackman riding on a mockup of the Batpod made out of garbage. In spite of the film's critical success, the film was noticeably absent from the Best Picture nominee list, prompting controversy and led many to criticize the Academy Awards for [...] "snubbing" [...] the film. There was speculation that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences later changed their number of Best Picture nominees to ten, instead of the traditional five, because of the film's omission. In a question-and-answer session that followed the announcement, the Academy's then president Sidney Ganis said; [...] "I would not be <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> if I said the words Dark Knight did not come up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I see, {{you think}} ill of us," [...] says Ballantrae, [...] "but I {{will show you}} how well we think of you by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> We are Jacobite fugitives, {{and there is a}} price upon our heads." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> You know {{it as well}} as I do myself;--and you're {{throwing}} yourself away, {{and throwing}} the man who loves you over,--for such a fellow as that! Go back to him, Ruby, and beg his pardon.' ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{young man}} {{shook his head}} a bit irritably. [...] "Pardon me, sir," [...] he said, [...] "but I am <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> I am not mistaken.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{but that}} isn't fair," [...] she cried. [...] "You {{give me the}} choice of lying to you and hurting you {{in order to protect}} myself by getting rid of you, or of {{throwing}} away my protection by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> for then you, as you said yourself, would stay and urge." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He will {{certainly}} die unless the right means {{are taken to}} save him, and taken at once. It is my duty not to flinch from <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> I have made a discovery since yesterday which satisfies me that I am right.

6000|$|... 'I {{thank you}} kindly, sir, but I'm simply <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> I am not ill, as men call it, though God knows whether there be not worse sicknesses than doctors know of. I'll tell you, {{as you are}} so kind, but I trust that you won't even mention such a thing to a living soul, for it might work me more and greater woe. I am {{suffering}} from a bad dream.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{said the}} word clearly and truly. [...] "And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so, Jeff. Oh, I don't shrink from <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> you see. You mean too much to me for me to {{dissemble}} it.

6000|$|... 'I am <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> Barbara, upon my word, but {{not half}} so strong as I could wish,' said Kit. 'When I {{want you to}} be pleased to see Miss Nell, it's only because I like you to be pleased with what pleases me--that's all. As to her, Barbara, I think I could almost die to do her service, but you would think so too, if you knew her as I do. I am sure you would.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{one with}} whom I would not change places, Harry. Don't laugh like that.
