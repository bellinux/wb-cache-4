The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} <b>time</b> <b>sharing</b> many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E
5|$|In Gannon's first match {{back at the}} club, {{the team}} lost a match 2–1 to joint-leaders Fleetwood Town, who {{achieved}} a record attendance in the fixture at Highbury. Gannon managed Stockport to their first back-to-back wins in over three years, since his last stint as manager, with successive 1–0 victories over Wrexham and Darlington. Gannon steered Stockport away from the drop zone, winning eight of the last 15 league games – when the side had only managed to win nine games throughout {{the whole of the}} 2010–11 campaign – to finish 16th in the final table. Gannon again focused on youth development, inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead, Cameron Darkwah, Danny Hattersley and Ian Ormson into the starting eleven.

5|$|After {{some initial}} issues with San Antonio over his contract, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004–05 season. This {{was his best}} season yet as he was {{selected}} as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase. During the playoffs, Ginóbili's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio's third championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4–1 in the Conference Finals, before prevailing in a very defensive oriented seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons. Ginóbili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg, and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs. In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan. The former finished the 2004–05 season as the second leading scorer on the team. During the season, he became only the fourth person to win consecutive Olimpias de Oro, this <b>time</b> <b>sharing</b> the award with soccer star Carlos Tévez.|$|E

25|$|E-mail {{was first}} invented for CTSS and similar <b>time</b> <b>sharing</b> {{systems of the}} era in the mid-1960s. At first, e-mail was {{possible}} only between different accounts on the same computer (typically a mainframe). ARPANET allowed different computers {{to be connected to}} allow e-mails to be relayed from computer to computer, with the first ARPANET e-mail being sent in 1971. Multics also pioneered instant messaging between computer users in the mid-1970s. With the growth of the Internet, e-mail began to be possible between any two computers with access to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Control Data Corporation {{developed}} the SCOPE operating {{system in the}} 1960s, for batch processing. In cooperation with the University of Minnesota, the Kronos and later the NOS operating systems were developed during the 1970s, which supported simultaneous batch and timesharing use. Like many commercial timesharing systems, its interface was {{an extension of the}} Dartmouth BASIC operating systems, one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages. In the late 1970s, Control Data and the University of Illinois {{developed the}} PLATO operating system, which used plasma panel displays and long-distance <b>time</b> <b>sharing</b> networks. Plato was remarkably innovative for its time, featuring real-time chat, and multi-user graphical games.|$|E

25|$|Norsk Data (ND) was a Norwegian {{manufacturer}} of minicomputers which operated between 1967 and 1992. The company was established as A/S Nordata – Norsk Data-Elektronikk on 7 July 1967 and took into use the Norsk Data brand in 1975. The company {{was founded by}} Lars Monrad-Krohn, Rolf Skår and Per Bjørge, three computer engineers working at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment which had just built the minicompter SAM 2. ND's first contract was the delivery of a Nord-1 computer to Norcontrol. Initially in competition with Kongsberg, ND started delivering computers to Norwegian institutions. By 1972 the company had developed Sintran operating system, the 32-bit Nord-5 and a <b>time</b> <b>sharing</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Parameters {{measured}} include acceleration, angular velocity, flow rate, position, pressure, temperature, voltage, current, frequency, and others. Sensor signals were {{conditioned by}} amplifiers or converters located in measuring racks. There are four measuring racks in the IU at locations 1, 9, and 15 and twenty signal conditioning modules in each. Conditioned signals were routed to their assigned telemetry channel by the measuring distributor at location 10. There were two telemetry links. In {{order for the}} two IU telemetry links to handle approximately 200 separate measurements, these links must be shared. Both frequency sharing and <b>time</b> <b>sharing</b> multiplexing techniques were used to accomplish this. The two modulation techniques used were pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and frequency modulation/frequency modulation (FM/FM).|$|E
500|$|By {{the latter}} half of the 1960s, higher-level {{programming}} languages such as BASIC which were able to be run on multiple types of computers further increased the reach of games developed at any given location. While most games were limited to text-based designs, rather than visual graphics like Spacewar, these games became more complicated as they reached more players, such as baseball and basketball simulation games. Access to the computers themselves was also extended to more people by systems such as the Dartmouth <b>Time</b> <b>Sharing</b> System (DTSS), which connected several thousand users through many remote terminals to a central mainframe computer. By the 1967–68 school year the DTSS library of 500 programs for the system included, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz wrote, [...] "many games". Over a quarter of the system's usage was for casual or entertainment purposes, and Kemeny and Kurtz noted that [...] "we have lost many a distinguished visitor for several hours while he quarterbacked the Dartmouth football team in a highly realistic simulated game".|$|E
