40|$|Exotic marine fish {{products}} are increasingly appreciated in China. In this study, 100 samples of Cod, Salmon and Tuna products {{were collected from}} supermarkets in Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou. First the information reported on the label were assessed {{in the light of}} the Chinese legislation, paying particular attention to the fish names and the geographical origin. Then, a comparative analysis of the official <b>trade</b> <b>denominations</b> adopted by five European countries (Italy, France, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom) for Cod, Salmon and Tuna was performed. Finally, the Chinese names of the species considered in the EU list were verified consulting the available international lists. Overall, 95 % of the samples employed just generic names. In particular, 98 % of Salmon and 100 % of Tuna products were generically labeled while the labeling of Cod products was more diversified, even though 80 % reported misleading or fake denominations. The results of this work highlighted the lack of a mandatory legislation on seafood traceability and of an official naming system. In particular, this study propose the introduction of a detailed Chinese naming system based on the Chinese Latin Dictionary for Seafood Names, following the EU approach. In fact, inaccurate labeling can have both economic and health implications for consumers as well as it may distort the true abundance of fish stocks. These drawbacks can be particularly serious considering the pivotal role of China in the global fishery industry...|$|R
50|$|SFSCs are {{classified}} by Renting et al. into face-to-face, proximate, extended. Face to face {{are characterized by}} physical encounters between producers and consumers (as {{in the case of}} farmers' markets). In the proximate short food supply chains producers are not necessarily managing product distribution ({{as in the case of}} consumers' cooperatives). In the extended short food supply chains, although geographical distances between producers and consumers may be long, consumers are aware of the identity of the producers and of the products (such as in the case of fair <b>trade</b> and protected <b>denominations</b> of origin).|$|R
