5|$|With Japan's {{entry into}} the war {{following}} the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became {{more likely that the}} division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not <b>think</b> <b>were</b> physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in order to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. In order to toughen the men up, Savige decided that they would march on foot to the new camp.|$|E

25|$|Paycocke's is a {{house built}} in or around 1500 by John Paycocke (d. 1505); it is thought it was built as a wedding present for his son Thomas and daughter-in-law Margaret as the {{initials}} T.P. and M.P. appear in the wood carvings that decorate the house. The house features elaborate wood panelling and carvings, {{a testament to the}} wealth generated by the wool trade in East Anglia. It also features gates which some <b>think</b> <b>were</b> taken from the Abbey {{at the time of its}} dissolution. The Paycocke family moved into Coggeshall in the 15th century and exemplified a trend for successful butchers to acquire large flocks of their own sheep which would produce wool as well as meat. The wool could be used to make cloth and often the 'grazing butchers' would eventually evolve into clothiers. These merchants frequently became very wealthy during this process. Thomas was the last Paycocke to live in Coggeshall, dying in 1580. It was the sold to the Buxton family who were clothiers and from 1746 changed hands several times eventually being bought by Lord Noel-Buxton, a descendant of the original Buxtons, and given to The National Trust in 1924. Restoration work was carried out in the 1960s and the house is now open to the public.|$|E

Broadly, I argue that our best theories of action can explain the possibility of intentionally pursuing what one <b>thinks</b> <b>is</b> not at all good, that we need to allow for the possibility of intentionally pursuing what one <b>think</b> <b>is</b> not at all good, and that if we can intentionally pursue what we <b>think</b> <b>is</b> not at all good then we can desire it on similar grounds...|$|R

500|$|The 1997 was {{the least}} {{successful}} season ever for the Highlanders. They finished last, and managed only three wins. They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches.

Even now, people <b>think</b> <b>were</b> crazy when I tell them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell.

The second part of the episode, however, was voted the third-worst of the season, with a rating of 7.14 However, the scene with Angela licking her cat was heavily criticized by reviewers, prompting some observers to describe it as the moment when The Office jumped the shark, a phrase used to describe the moment of downturn for a previously successful television show. When asked about this during an interview, actor Oscar Nuñez responded, [...] "No show is 'Jump the Shark'-proof, but there have been other moments on The Office that I <b>think</b> <b>were</b> more 'Jump the Shark' than that."

500|$|The story Cipriano {{originally}} [...] {{wanted in}} The Inquirer was never published. Cipriano accused The Inquirer of censoring his report and giving into demands from the Archdiocese. Cipriano eventually {{was published in}} the National Catholic Reporter and editor Robert Rosenthal accused Cipriano of bias {{and not being able to}} prove his stories. Rosenthal said Cipriano [...] "has a very strong personal point of view and an agenda...There were things we didn't publish that Ralph wrote that we didn't <b>think</b> <b>were</b> truthful. He could never prove them." [...] Cipriano sued Rosenthal and The Inquirer for libel and the case was later settled out of court. In an 2001 interview with the Editor & Publisher, Cardinal Bevilacqua credited Tierney with stopping the story and noted that The Philadelphia Inquirers stories about the Archdiocese have been more positive. In 1998 Tierney was named a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II.|$|E

D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year, helped move Republican leadership. Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote. With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch, Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote. She received her commission on October 7. [...] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: [...] "That series of questions, I <b>think,</b> <b>were</b> symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [...] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today." ...|$|E

On another occasion, Hunt grabbed the microphone cord and cracked it like a whip, which yanked the microphone out of Walker's hand.

Development had lasted {{over two years}} as Stern, who had final script approval, [...] "rejected every script there was ... they were over the top comedies that I <b>think</b> <b>were</b> dumb, boring and dull". After producer Ivan Reitman got involved with the project, Stern agreed to a script developed by Len Blum and Michael Kalesniko. Filming began in May 1996 with director Betty Thomas, and lasted four months with Stern, Quivers and Norris acting as their younger and current self. The crew travelled to the film set after each radio show and stayed there to shoot on weekends. Stern embarked on an extensive publicity tour to promote the film which included numerous television appearances and magazine interview {{in his attempt to}} appeal to people who were not listeners of his radio show. Private Parts premiered on February 27, 1997 at The Theater at Madison Square Garden; outside the theatre Stern and Rob Zombie performed [...] "The Great American Nightmare", a track they recorded for its soundtrack. The film's wide release followed on March 7, 1997. It topped the US box office in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million, and earned a domestic total of $41.2 million. In 1998, Stern received a Blockbuster Entertainment award for Favorite Male Newcomer and nominations for a Golden Satellite Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Comedy) and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star. The soundtrack, , sold 178,000 copies in its first week of release and entered the Billboard 200 chart in the United States at number one in March 1997, the highest selling debut release for a soundtrack to a feature film. Three months after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping one million copies.
