5|$|Although not well-studied, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It {{is not known}} when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of Buckeyes in the Standard {{has been a}} significant factor in its survival. In the past, largely due its lack of color variations, the Buckeye has not been an especially popular exhibition breed, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> interest in the exhibition poultry fancy for this dual-purpose variety of bird. Not adopted by commercial operations, the Buckeye has generally been a bird of smaller farm flocks. Today the breed status is listed as threatened by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, threatened being defined as: Fewer than 1,000 breeding birds in the United States, with seven or fewer primary breeding flocks, and estimated global population less than 5,000. The breed is also included in the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction.|$|E

25|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping (CSM) {{is considered}} {{the gold standard for}} mapping functional regions of the brain to create a presurgical plan that maximizes the patient's functional outcome.

However, because it has the drawback of being an intraoperative technique, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> debate about its status as the preferred method.

25|$|Despite the {{therapeutic}} effectiveness and proven success of CBT, treatment availability is significantly limited {{by a lack}} of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, and expense. One way to potentially overcome these barriers is to use the Internet to deliver treatment, making this effective intervention more accessible and less costly. The Internet has already become a critical source of health-care and medical information. Although the vast majority of health websites provide general information, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> research literature on the development and evaluation of Internet interventions.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists such as Paul Goldstein {{have argued}} that the Tiwanaku empire {{expanded}} outside of the altiplano area and into the Moquegua Valley in Peru.

Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound. Evidence of similar types of artificial cranial deformation in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.|$|E
25|$|Retention {{of nurses}} by sending (often developing) {{countries}} {{can be addressed}} by improving working conditions, minimizing wage differentials, and promoting medical tourism. Retention can also be promoted through educational activities to improve job satisfaction. There can be additional unintended impacts of nurses migration abroad. For example, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>growing</b> evidence that physicians in the Philippines have shifted to the nursing field for better export opportunities. The World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Manila believes the government should invest more into its health sector as it is 3% of the Philippines' GDP.
