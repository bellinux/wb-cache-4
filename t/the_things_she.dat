5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> did were <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|Stefani {{first came}} {{face to face}} with {{designing}} clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made most of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E

Severely disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.|$|E

5|$|Scáthach teaches Cú Chulainn all {{the arts}} of war, {{including}} the use of the Gáe Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

Elbe was sometimes introduced by Gottlieb as her own sister when {{she was dressed in}} female attire. Only her closest friends knew once she had transitioned.|$|E
6000|$|Madame shivered, {{and closed}} her eyes. Presently, however, she opened them again, and stirred. Then she put her head from the window. [...] "A {{carriage}} is approaching," [...] she announced, and her tone conveyed <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> feared.|$|R

25|$|It {{is known}} that Douty went {{straight}} from the ferry to her room to drop off <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had bought which included presents for her younger son's upcoming 19th birthday. Taking the new red towel she had just purchased she headed to secluded Dinghy Bay. Butler had been following her but lost her at this time.

25|$|The studio's {{official}} {{press release}} was presented on May 20, 2010 and confirmed that Smallville would be remaining at its Friday, 8 p.m. time slot. It {{also revealed that}} Smallville would be reteaming with Supernatural, a series that was originally slotted just behind Smallville on Thursday nights for four seasons. The press release did not list Mack {{in the list of}} stars. On May 21, 2010, Mack released a statement confirming that she would not return as a series regular, but would return for multiple episodes to wind up her storyline. However, at the 2010 Comic-Con, Peterson stated that, despite her long absence and limited episode count, Mack would remain a series regular. Mack stated that her hope is that the character of Chloe will hold on to her integrity as the writers close out her storyline. For the actress, watching as her character matured over the years—from sacrificing <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wanted for the sake of her friends, to finally reaching a point where she can strive to satisfy her own needs and wants—has been important for her. Tom Welling, who served as a part-time producer for season nine, was announced as a full executive producer for season ten. Welling was also set to direct two episodes during the season, and Justin Hartley was contracted to direct another episode.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Jo {{glanced over}} her shoulder, {{but no one was}} in sight; and rather liking the joke of <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>she</b> laughed back, saying, [...] "Well, if you won't mention it, I think I will;" [...] and with two nimble steps was in the willow.|$|R
500|$|Kiper {{had told}} Shapovalov about the dream, {{and wrote the}} second phrase of the song, [...] "Mne nuzhna ona", which means [...] "I need her"; this led to Shapovalov {{conveying}} the theme of lesbianism through the track and its English language counterpart, [...] "All <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said". Shapovalov had been accused by Russian media for taking the idea of Kiper and conveying it as his own, whilst Kiper stated that the idea was all thought by herself. [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] was written by Sergio Galoyan, Kiper and Valeriy Polienko, whilst production was handled by the group's manager, Shapovalov. He also composed the track, and it was recorded by him at the Neformat Studios, Russia in the early 2000. Two versions of the single were released—the original version and an edited version that used the backing track of [...] "All <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said"; this version appeared on 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane (2002).|$|E
500|$|The bridge section has {{the girls}} laying in water while snow starts to fall. At the last {{portion of the}} chorus, t.A.T.u. are portrayed {{pointing}} in different directions, until they both walk around corner and see a vast field, where the sun is breaking out of the clouds; they clasp hands and walk off into the distance. The {{people on the other}} side of the fence are left in an eerie green light with rain falling steadily; it is also revealed that they are the ones isolated behind the fence. The video's final scene shows the girls walking further in the distance. Several frames from [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] did not appear in the visual for [...] "All <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said" [...] due to lip-syncing issues. Like [...] "All <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said", the video generated controversy for having the duo kissing, with critics particularly believing that it prompted paedophilia and lesbianism. An editor from The Age commented that the impact of the video for [...] "Ya Soshla s Uma" [...] was generally lukewarm.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot at}} Khodynka Field, Moscow by Shapovalov, and portrayed t.A.T.u. wearing school girl outfits and kissing each other behind an iron-wired fence. Whilst the kissing scene from [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] was heavily controversial in Russian media, the English adaption [...] "All <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> <b>She</b> Said" [...] popularised the group worldwide and further caused controversy. In order to promote the single, the band performed it on their 2001–02 200 Po Vstrechnoy concert tour, and it was included on their compilation albums t.A.T.u. Remixes (2003) and The Best (2006).|$|E

She has {{the powers of}} tactile telepathy and hypnosis which allows her to control or convince others to do <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wants them to by physical touch. However, Victor is immune to telepathy. Describing her role, Collins said [...] "I had to play off all the guys and their testosterone-heavy abilities. But I learned that the female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns." [...] Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts, despite her enthusiasm to work with Jackman.|$|E
500|$|... "Dance for You" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Beyoncé for the deluxe {{edition of}} her fourth studio album, 4 (2011).
