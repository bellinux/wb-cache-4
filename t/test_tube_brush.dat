40|$|Abstract A silver- and zinc-containing zeolite matrix (AgION) {{used as a}} coating for {{stainless}} steel was tested for antimicrobial efficacy against Escherichia coli 25922, Staphylococcus aureus 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, and Listeria monocytogenes 7644. Assays were performed on flat coupon surfaces and in formed steel cups. AgION reduced microbial colony-forming units when compared to uncoated steel surfaces under all conditions tested. Percent reductions ranged from 84. 536 to 99. 999 after 4 h exposure, and from 99. 992 to 100 after 24 h in all cases. The durability of the coatings declined most markedly when the coating had been applied with a wet process and scrubbed between uses with a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> <b>brush.</b> Powder-coated surfaces cleaned with a towel re-tained {{a high degree of}} activity after five cycles of use...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{fish farming}} is an {{important}} and growing industry. Fouling organisms that grow on the net cages and other structural components of the fish farms are a substantial problem for the industry. The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of net twine with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> <b>brush.</b> The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small net sections and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few twines can be extrapolated to net panel applications. The drag coefficients for the net sections in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the net sections with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to ASTM C 672, XPP 18 - 420 (French Standard) (XPP 18 420 1995) was also used. This scaling test consisted of submerging <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> of concrete in the NaCl solution for 24  h of 56 consecutive freeze–thaw cycles between + 20 and − 20  °C. For each measurement (after {{each of the}} first seven cycles as well as after the end of all 56 cycles), the <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> were <b>brushed,</b> and the loosened particles were collected and washed. They were dried in a stove at a temperature of 105  ±  5  °C overnight and then weighed {{in order to determine the}} dried mass. The NaCl solution was then renewed, and the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> was placed back inside. The cumulated mass of the particles detached from the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> surface, called the scaling cumulated mass, was thus calculated according to the cycle number.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm for designing the equilibrium base-pairing properties of a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> of interacting nucleic acid strands. A target <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> is specified {{as a set}} of desired “on-target” complexes, each with a target secondary structure and target concentration, and a set of undesired “off-target” complexes, each with vanishing target concentration. Sequence design is performed by optimizing the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect, corresponding to the concentration of incorrectly paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of the <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> To reduce the computational cost of accepting or rejecting mutations to a random initial sequence, the structural ensemble of each on-target complex is hierarchically decomposed into a tree of conditional subensembles, yielding a forest of decomposition trees. Candidate sequences are evaluated efficiently at the leaf level of the decomposition forest by estimating the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect from conditional physical properties calculated over the leaf subensembles. As optimized subsequences are merged toward the root level of the forest, any emergent defects are eliminated via ensemble redecomposition and sequence reoptimization. After successfully merging subsequences to the root level, the exact <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect is calculated for the first time, explicitly checking for the effect of the previously neglected off-target complexes. Any off-target complexes that form at appreciable concentration are hierarchically decomposed, added to the decomposition forest, and actively destabilized during subsequent forest reoptimization. For target <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> representative of design challenges in the molecular programming and synthetic biology communities, our <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> design algorithm typically succeeds in achieving a normalized <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect ≤ 1 % at a design cost within an order of magnitude of the cost of <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> analysis...|$|R
