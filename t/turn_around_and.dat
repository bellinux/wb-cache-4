5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> {{continued}} straight on, crashing {{somewhere in the}} Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor {{and back to the}} recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E

5|$|That night, two U.S. Army heavy {{equipment}} transporters entered {{the city of}} Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|One of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, {{had lost}} a topmast {{sometime}} earlier and as result was slower {{than the rest of}} the squadron. Falling behind the others, Gerraro soon found that his ship was in danger of being isolated by Lion, as Dixon steered for the rapidly opening gap between the Spanish ships. Recognising the danger, O'Neil ordered the front three frigates to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> sail to the defence of Santa Dorotea, passing close by Lion and opening a heavy fire at 11:15. Lion replied, and the Spanish frigates did not immediately turn back for a second pass, continuing ahead as Dixon closed with the straggling Santa Dorotea. In an effort to deter the ship of the line, Gerraro opened fire on Lion with his stern chasers, cannon situated in the frigate's stern, which caused considerable damage to Dixon's rigging. As Lion began to close the distance, O'Neil's ships returned, but the frigates passed Lion at extreme distance, their broadsides having no effect and again coming under fire themselves.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E

25|$|Double acting ship {{is a type}} of icebreaking ship {{designed}} to run ahead in open water and thin ice, but <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> proceed astern (backwards) in heavy ice conditions.

25|$|Some former Nazis escaped any charges. For example, Reinhard Gehlen, {{a former}} {{intelligence}} {{officer of the}} Wehrmacht, managed to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> work for the CIA, and created what informally {{became known as the}} Gehlen Organization. He recruited ex–intelligence-officers of the Wehrmacht and Nazis from the SS and SD to work for him. On 1 April 1956, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND; the German intelligence agency) was created from the Gehlen Organization, and transferred to the West German government. Reinhard Gehlen became President of the BND and remained its head until 1968.|$|E
25|$|Lechmere is {{the north}} end of the Green Line. From the opening of the Lechmere Viaduct leading to it in 1912 until 1922, {{streetcar}} lines simply fed onto the viaduct from Cambridge Street and Bridge Street (now Monsignor O'Brien Highway). In 1922 a prepayment station was opened, with a new loop for subway trains to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> a separate loop for surface cars, and no intermingling between the two. The surface lines have since been replaced with buses, but the Green Line still turns around at Lechmere.|$|E
25|$|The Hanoi area {{formerly}} {{held by the}} Han and Jin dynasties {{was easily}} recovered from the local ruler in 602. A few years later the Sui army pushed farther south and was attacked by troops on war elephants from Champa in southern Vietnam. The Sui army feigned retreat and dug pits to trap the elephants, lured the Champan troops to attack then used crossbows against the elephants causing them to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> trample their own soldiers. Although Sui troops were victorious many succumbed to disease as northern soldiers did not have immunity to tropical diseases such as malaria.|$|E

25|$|Hawking {{radiation}} {{is required by}} the Unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black hole horizons. Close to the event horizon of a black hole, a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in. An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of particles that pop out of the local acceleration horizon, <b>turn</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> free-fall back in. The condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity, which implies {{that some of these}} particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing Hawking radiation.|$|E
25|$|While the Israelis were preparing, the {{two ships}} started moving: the Emir Farouk went {{north and the}} {{minesweeper}} went south. This hastened the Israeli attack. Abramov's boat attacked first, causing the Egyptians to fire at random. Vardi's boat mistakenly turned to attack the Emir Farouk as well. Vardi failed to eject due to a technical difficulty, but managed to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> strike again. In the dark, Abramov believed that Vardi's was the extraction boat and caught on, but detached from it as well before it rammed into the Egyptian ship. Vardi's actions also confused Yitzhak Brockman on the rescue boat, who had been moving toward the Emir Farouk, and now believed that Vardi was turning around to collect Abramov. Brockman therefore started moving in Bin-Nun's direction.|$|E
25|$|During the {{recession}} of 2008, SNAP participation hit an all-time high. Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that “putting more resources quickly {{into the hands of}} the people most likely to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people who face a constant struggle against hunger.” Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a weak economy.|$|E

25|$|Lee {{devised a}} complex plan to pursue and destroy McClellan's army. Longstreet's and A.P. Hill's {{divisions}} looped back toward Richmond and then southeast to the crossroads at Glendale, Holmes's division headed farther south, to {{the vicinity of}} Malvern Hill, and Magruder's division was ordered to move due east to attack the Federal rear guard. Stonewall Jackson, commanding three divisions, was to rebuild a bridge over the Chickahominy and head due south to Savage's Station, where he would link up with Magruder and deliver a strong blow that might cause the Union Army to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> fight during its retreat. McClellan's rear guard at Savage's Station consisted five divisions from Sumner's II Corps, Heintzelman's III Corps, and Franklin's VI Corps. McClellan considered his senior corps commander, Sumner, to be incompetent, so he appointed no one to command the rear guard.|$|E

Stonewall Jackson, commanding his own division, {{as well as the}} divisions of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill and Brig. Gen. William H. C.

25|$|With {{the fall}} of Fort Henry General Grant was now {{preparing}} to move overland and capture Fort Donelson, approximately twelve {{miles to the east}} on the Cumberland River. Foote at this time insisted on returning to Cairo for badly needed repairs on his gunboats. After learning that only the Carondelet would lend naval support to his Army he urged General Halleck to have Foote promptly send more ironclads. Needing more time, Foote, however, relented and transferred men from the damaged gunboats to become part of another flotilla. On February 12, the gunboats Saint Louis, Pittsburg and Louisville passed the Conestoga and Lexington on their way to Cairo for repairs. Foote hailed the vessels and ordered Phelps to <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> join his flotilla. The badly damaged Lexington, however, continued on, while Phelps, aboard the Conestoga, joined forces with Foote and together proceeded up the Ohio River.|$|E
