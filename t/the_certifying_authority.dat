30|$|At step (1), a {{challenge}} message {{with a fresh}} nonce is issued to a platform (in this case, the TED) to attest its identity and integrity with the application service. Once this message is received, the TED platform at step (2) calls a TPM function to generate an Attestation Identity Key (AIK) and the TPM credentials. These credentials, along with other credentialsa the public part of the AIK and the original challenge nonce are signed by the private TPM Endorsement Key. The resulting signed credential is then encrypted using the public part of the certifying authority’s key. This is then sent at step (3) to <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> as a request to validate its credentials. If successful, <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> creates a signed, encrypted credential that is {{sent back to the}} platform at step (4). Step (5) is used to produce an encrypted summary of measurements of the environment held in sealed storage (the Platform Configuration Registers, or PCR) in the TPM chip. (e.g. one measurement may be a list of loaded and running processes just after boot, another measurement may be a new list of running processes several hours after boot). This encrypted measurement information is then sent back to the challenger, along with the identity credential received from <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> at step (6). Upon reception of the message, the challenging application service now validates at step (7) the measured environment and compares it to its own expected measurements that it holds. During this process, the challenging application service checks the identity credential to determine that it was signed by <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority,</b> as well as verifying the signature of the measured values and that it contains the original challenge nonce. Depending on the application requirements, step (8) may optionally be used to signal to the application client the success of the measurement and attestation process.|$|E

Nineteen eighty-five was {{the year}} in which the first halal-certified non-meat product {{appeared}} in South African stores. <b>The</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> was the Muslim Judicial Council of Cape Town and the product was Flora-margarine. The certification of a non-meat product signaled a major shift in halal in South Africa. It represented the development of a halal consciousness that extended beyond the realm of purely meat products and into the unseen, intangible, expert-controlled world of food technology. Other developments also contributed to the growing halal industry in South Africa. The end of apartheid resulted in freedom of movement for the previously disadvantaged Muslim community. The newfound freedom resulted in increased demand for halal consumption in places previously restricted or considered unwelcoming. Changes in lifestyle resulted in an increase in dual income households and overall standards of living amongst middle class Muslims. These changes contributed to an increase in demand for packaged food, dining out and the cost effective, one-stop shopping that mass retailers offered. Muslims began to spend more time on vacation, at shopping malls and at restaurants. This change in consumption behavior resulted in a demand for halal products. This demand precipitated into requests fo...|$|E

Unlike biofortification with provitamin A, biofortification with minerals, such as iron and zinc, {{does not change the}} color or the appearance of the biofortified crop. Therefore, we test the impact of both nutrition information, and branding and certification, as well as the nature of the brand and of <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> (state level versus international), on consumer demand for HIPM. We find that {{even in the absence of}} nutrition information, consumers assign a small but significant premium to the HIPM variety relative to the local variety. This is consistent with consumers’ more favorable rating of the sensory characteristics of the high-iron variety. Nutrition information on the health benefits of HIPM increases this premium substantially, and regression analysis reveals that consumers prefer international branding and international certification authority to their state-level counterparts.

40|$|When {{determining}} {{the uncertainty of}} an environmental noise calculation result, {{an assessment of the}} quality of the implementation of the used method in the software is required. Here, Nordtest Method Framework for the Verification of Environmental Noise Calculation Software ACOU 107 (2001) may prove useful. This describes a framework to verify that software intended for calculation of environmental noise levels conforms with a specific calculation method. The verification process requires a number of standard test cases for each method, with known, certified calculation results and accepted tolerances. The method was developed for Nordic calculation but, in principle, can be applied to all other methods. Thus, in 2004, the Brüel & Kjær Prediction Partnership decided to comply with it for all methods implemented in their software – Predictor Type 7810 and Lima Type 7812.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework for certification of fish production and monitoring facilities including software templates to expedite implementation of the framework are presented. The framework is based on well established and widely utilized project management techniques. The implementation templates are overlays for Microsoft Professional Office software products: Excel, Word, and Project. Use of the software templates requires Microsoft Professional Office. The certification framework integrates two classical project management processes with a third process for facility certification. These processes are: (1) organization and definition of the project, (2) acquisition and organization of project documentation, and (3) facility certification. The certification process consists of systematic review of the production processes and {{the characteristics of the}} produced product. The criteria for certification review are the plans and specifications for the products and production processes that guided development of the facility. The facility is certified when the production processes are operating as designed and the product produced meets specifications. Within this framework, certification is a performance based process, not dissimilar from that practiced in many professions and required for many process, or a product meets professional/industry standards of performance. In the case of fish production facilities, <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authority</b> may be diffuse, consisting of many entities acting through a process such as NEPA.

40|$|A clear {{need was}} {{established}} by the aero-engine manufacturers and <b>the</b> <b>certifying</b> <b>authorities</b> for a re-assessment of the published rules governing engine certification for large flocking birds.

This paper discusses the implementation of the Monte-Carlo technique to simulate bird strike events from the Rolls-Royce viewpoint and describes the various refinements that have been made in order to ensure an adequate comparison with observed service data. Subsequent to this benchmarking process, the results from the analysis have been used to calculate engine shut-down rates for various proposed large bird rule scenarios ultimately leading to the acceptance of a new flocking bird certification requirement for engines of inlet area of 2. 5 m 2 and above.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{algorithm}} for watermarking a grayscale digital image with a binary watermark in the DCT domain. The algorithm is transparent since the watermark is not really embedded in the host image. This results in zero distortion of the watermarked host image. The embedded watermark is robust to most common unintentional attacks by intelligently utilizing {{the signs of the}} DC components of the DCTtransformed host image blocks. The algorithm is blind since only the secret keys are required for watermark extraction. These secret keys are in the form of two shares. One of the shares is registered to <b>the</b> <b>Certified</b> <b>Authority</b> (CA) for additional security and protection against intentional attacks. The size of each share is much smaller than that of other techniques in the literature and the shares are generated faster. The algorithm is practical due to its very fast speed of both watermark embedding and extraction. The paper also proposes an extended version of Torus Automorphism (TA) permutation for scrambling the watermark before embedding and to reassemble it after extraction for additional security against intentional attacks...|$|R

40|$|It is a {{generally}} known fact that Hungarian products {{are at a}} disadvantage in Western markets, since a certain part of foreign customers have not yet heard of Hungarian products. Many of them believe that products made in Eastern Europe are cheap and of poor quality. How could they possibly know Hungarian products, if national food producers and traders can only invest a minimal amount to promote their products? Food producers in EU countries spend far much more to market their products than their fellows in Hungary.
