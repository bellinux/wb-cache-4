She published several further papers on this work which {{has become part of the}} mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal. This work was covered in a 1993 monograph, and in the regularly-published textbook Chemistry and Physics of Carbon. Mering continued the study of carbon in various forms, using X-ray diffraction and other methods.|$|E

John Rash of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern-day scourge."
