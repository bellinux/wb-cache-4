By applying the fin approach, models {{with and without}} streamwise conduction term in the energy equation were developed for hydrodynamically and thermally fully-developed flow. These two models were solved to obtain closed form analytical solutions for the nanofluid and solid wall temperature distributions and the analysis emphasized details of the variations induced by the streamwise conduction on the nanofluid heat transport characteristics. The effects of the Peclet number, nanoparticle volume fraction, thermal conductivity ratio on the <b>thermal</b> characteristics of <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> in microchannel heat sinks are analyzed.

40|$|International audienceSilicon is {{the most}} widely used {{semiconductor}} for photovoltaic solar cells, arid also the most extensively studied. The need for cost reduction lead solar cell producers to look for cheaper raw silicon, allowing a higher impurity content in the charge used as input for crystallization and making it very different from the extensively studied electronic-grade silicon. In order to keep a good efficiency of the solar cells, the impurities that have a huge impact over the electrical properties of the material should be removed born the final ingot. Controlling the segregation of impurities during the solidification is therefore mandatory. A study of the solidification of metallurgical grade silicon under controlled solidification parameters such as growth rate, <b>thermal</b> gradient and <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> flow was conducted in a Bridgman set-up. <b>Forced</b> <b>convection</b> was induced by a travelling magnetic field (TMF) during the solidification, and resulted in a mixing of excess impurities in the liquid, removing them from the vicinity of the solidification front.

40|$|International audienceThermal {{recovery}} from a {{hot dry rock}} (HDR) reservoir viewed as a deformable fractured medium is investigated {{with a focus on}} the assumption of local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE). Hydraulic diffusion, <b>thermal</b> diffusion, <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> and deformation are considered in a two-phase framework, the solid phase being made by impermeable solid blocks separated by saturated fractures. The finite element approximation of the constitutive and field equations is formulated and applied to obtain the response of a generic HDR reservoir to circulation tests. A change of time profile of the outlet fluid temperature is observed as the fracture spacing increases, switching from a single-step pattern to a double-step pattern, a feature which is viewed as characteristic of established LTNE. A dimensionless number is proposed to delineate between local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and non-equilibrium. This number embodies local physical properties of the mixture, elements of the geometry of the reservoir and the production flow rate. All the above properties being fixed, the resulting fracture spacing threshold between LTNE and LTE is found to decrease with increasing porosity or fluid velocity. The thermally induced effective stress is tensile near the injection well, illustrating the thermal contraction of the rock, while the pressure contribution of the fracture fluid is negligible during the late period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The resonant-mass {{technique}} {{for the detection}} of Gravitational Waves may involve, in the near future, the cooling of very large masses (about 100 tons) from room temperature (300 K) to extreme cryogenic temperatures (20 mK). To cool these detectors down to cryogenic temperatures an exchange gas (helium) is used, and the heat is removed from the antenna to the cold reservoir by thermal conduction and natural convection. With the current technique, cooling times of about one month can be obtained for cylindrical bar antennas of 2. 5 tons. Should this same technique be used to cool a 100 -ton spherical antenna the cooling time would be about 10 months, making the operation of these antennas impracticable.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 From the {{practice}} in computer industry the standard approach for electronics cooling is fan-cooled heat sinks. We developed <b>thermal</b> models for <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> heat sinks. An Intel Pentium ill chip has been adopted as a preliminary design case to develop necessary equations. We found the heat dissipated from the aluminum heat sink, based upon different modes of airflow over the fins. We also considered radiation heat transfer. We performed transient heat transfer analysis to determine the time to attain the steady state temperature for the whole system for macro and micro scale also. Next, we refined our one-dimensional analytical convection analysis using the numerical analysis. This was done using the computational fluid dynamics code Fluent to obtain accurate velocity fields over the fins. Using these improved velocities, convective heat transfer coefficients were computed. Next, we have miniaturized the processor chip size to the micrometer scale and have designed a heat sink based upon the models we have developed.

40|$|This work {{reviews and}} compares {{suitable}} {{models for the}} <b>thermal</b> analysis of <b>forced</b> <b>convection</b> over a heat source in a porous medium. The set of available models refers to an infinite medium in which a fluid moves over different three heat source geometries: i. e. the moving infinite line source, the moving finite line source, and the moving infinite cylindrical source. In this perspective, the present work presents a plain and handy compendium of the above-mentioned models for <b>forced</b> external <b>convection</b> in porous media; besides, we propose a dimensionless analysis {{to figure out the}} reciprocal deviation among available models, helping the selection of the most suitable one in the specific case of interest. Under specific conditions, the advection term becomes ineffective in terms of heat transfer performances, allowing the use of purely-conductive models. For that reason, available analytical and numerical solutions for purely-conductive media are also reviewed and compared, again, by dimensionless criteria. Therefore, one can choose the simplest solution, with significant benefits in terms of computational effort and interpretation of the results. The main outcomes presented in the paper are: the conditions under which the system can be considered subject to a Darcy flow, the minimal distance beyond which the finite dimension of the heat source does not affect the thermal field, and the critical fluid velocity needed to have a significant contribution of the advection term in the overall heat transfer process...|$|R

Airborne Doppler-radar divergence profiles from nine diverse mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are presented. The MCSs consisted of multicellular convective elements which in time gave rise to areas of stratiform precipitation. Each of the three basic building blocks of the MCSs - convective, intermediary, and stratiform precipitation areas - has a consistent, characteristic divergence profile. Convective areas have low-level convergence, with its peak at 2 - 4 km altitude, and divergence above 6 km. Intermediary areas have convergence aloft, peaked near 10 km, feeding into mean ascent high in the upper troposphere. Stratiform areas have mid-level convergence, indicating a mesoscale downdraught below the melting level, and a mesoscale updraught aloft. Rawinsonde composite divergence profiles agree with the Doppler data {{in at least one}} important respect: the lower-tropospheric convergence into the MCSs peaks 2 - 4 -km above the surface. Rawinsonde vorticity profiles show that monsoonal tropical cyclones spin-up at these elevated levels first, then later descend to the surface. Rawinsonde observations on a larger, continental scale demonstrate that at large horizontal scales only the 'gravest vertical mode' of MCS heating is felt, while the effects of shallower components of the heating (or divergence) profiles are trapped near the heating, as predicted by geostrophic adjustment theory...|$|R

The authors’ in-house C++ previously-developed code was modified to calculate the amount of heat transfer by convection and radiation. In this software, an iterative Broydon-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) inverse method was applied to estimate the amount of heat delivered to the plate when the appropriate sensitivity criteria were defined. The methodology was validated by accomplishing lab-controlled experiments on stainless steel AISI 304 L and aluminum 6065 T 5 plates.
