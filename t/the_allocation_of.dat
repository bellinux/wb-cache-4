In couple families with only older (than 12 years) children, <b>the</b> time <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> partners appear to be independent. In contrast, in couple families with younger children the time allocated to home duties and employment-related activities by the partners are substitutes. Children therefore affect <b>the</b> time <b>allocation</b> decisions in couple families through reducing the apparent complementarity in time <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> their parents...|$|R

5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about <b>the</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from North Africa, No. 6 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. The grouping of the commandos into brigades underneath the divisional-sized Special Service Group headquarters was part of the general reorganisation that took place in late 1943 as the evolution of their role from raiding to assault infantry was formalised. This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in <b>the</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> indirect and direct fire support weapons at commando level. Further support units were added at brigade level, including administration, transport, logistics and signals.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Gardner and James Patton {{suggested}} in 1976 that Allen's O.rivularis {{may be the}} same species as O.bombycinus. They considered O.bolivaris as probably the same as O.nitidus and listed castaneus as a synonym of O.capito (equivalent to modern Hylaeamys megacephalus and closely related species plus Transandinomys talamancae). In 1984, Benshoof and colleagues reported the first record of Oryzomys bombycinus from Honduras. Guy Musser and Marina Williams reviewed O.talamancae in 1985 and included O.castaneus {{as one of its}} synonyms, though without having examined the holotype. In the 1993 second edition of Mammal Species of the World, Musser and Michael Carleton used the name Oryzomys bolivaris for the species previously known as O.bombycinus, and in 1998, Musser and colleagues fully documented <b>the</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the names bolivaris, castaneus, rivularis, bombycinus, alleni, and orinus to the same species, Oryzomys bolivaris. They noted its similarity to O.talamancae, but did not attempt to determine phylogenetic relationships among the species they discussed. In their limited material, they found geographic variation within the species inconsequential and they recognized no subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{despatched}} his lieutenant Baltasar Guerra {{to pacify}} the rebel Chiapanecas and Zoques, and the victorious conquistadores in turn demanded encomiendas. The general instability continued, but the Mazariegos family managed {{to establish a}} power base in the local colonial institutions. In 1535, the Mazariegos faction succeeded in having San Cristóbal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative. In practise, the quick turnover of encomiendas continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists. At around the same time, the Audiencia de los Confines intervened, appointing judges to exert greater control over <b>the</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> encomiendas.|$|E
