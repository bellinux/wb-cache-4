The station's passenger usage seems set to grow further, as there has been considerable housing development on brownfield land, which was the site of a mine, within a few hundred yards of the station. Indeed, the town continues to grow, overall, as a commuter suburb.|$|R
500|$|Roper {{was asked}} to {{demonstrate}} his 'self propeller' at the Charles River velodrome, a banked concrete bicycle racing track, where he first paced the racing cyclists, then raced professional rider Nat Butler, easily outpacing the bicyclists with timed laps at around 30mph (120.2sec/mile on the 1/3mile track). He was then encouraged to give a demonstration of maximum speed, and was timed at over 40mph, when a 'sudden pallor' was seen on his face, and his machine wobbled to a stop, Roper falling off his cycle.

50|$|The second depot {{was built}} in 1902, and was {{electrified}} {{with the rest of}} the line three years later. The 1902-built station originally had a canopy above the Valley Stream-bound platform, that extended southwest of the station house, and another one above Cedar Lane designed to protect horse carriage passengers from rain, snow, and other inclement weather. A freight house also existed across the tracks. The canopy for horse carriages was abandoned around 1939. <b>The</b> <b>track-side</b> covered platforms were removed with the installation of high-level platforms sometime around 1968. Aside from these modifications, the station still exists as it {{was built in}} 1902.|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to notice that these last two figures provide the utilisation rate (assuming 20 daily operating hours) {{as a function of}} the number of movements in the stations; it means that each train (entering the station and then leaving) in reality counts for 2 movements (i.e. the total number of served trains is equal to half of the total number of movements). Additionally the abacuses account for different scenarios related to the percentages of trains which only pass through the node (thus on the main tracks, i.e. platforms 1 and 2), which stop on <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> platforms (1 and 2) and/or which stop on passing platforms.|$|R
50|$|The {{newcomer}} Enrique Bernoldi, racing for Arrows, retired on lap three after {{colliding with}} the wall {{out of the}} first corner. A lap later, Jacques Villeneuve's BAR ran into the back of Ralf Schumacher's Williams at high speed whilst Schumacher was braking into turn three. The collision launched Villeneuve's car into the air toward <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> concrete barriers, shedding wheels and bodywork as it cart-wheeled along the wall to a halt deep in the gravel trap. Ralf Schumacher spun into the same gravel trap after bottoming across the track and kerbs, with a missing rear wing and apparently compromised rear-left suspension, incapable of rejoining the race.|$|R
50|$|The Great Train gang intercepted the Glasgow-London {{mail train}} in Buckinghamshire {{in the early}} hours of 8 August 1963. After {{tampering}} with <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> signal lights, they stopped the train at Sears Crossing and moved the engine and high-value carriage to Bridego Bridge, near Cheddington, and they escaped with £2,600,000 of used banknotes (£ today). The driver, Jack Mills, was beaten over the head and suffered from related complications for the rest of his life—opinion is divided as to whether the injury was a factor in his death. The gang's temporary hideout at Leatherslade Farm was quickly found. Most of the gang were captured, tried, and imprisoned, but Edwards evaded arrest with his £150,000 share of the stolen money.|$|R

The three had followed each other closely through the first three rounds, but in the fourth heat, Silvio Fauner and Bjørn Dæhlie managed to break with Jari Isometsä. The event was the best attended of any in the games, with an estimated 100,000 spectators at the stadium and along the tracks.

40|$|Under {{the generic}} term ‘Next Generation Train - NGT’ the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has {{introduced}} vehicle concepts for various railway applications. All train concepts {{have in common}} that the required energy {{is supposed to be}} supplied through a catenary-free energy transfer system that uses inductive power transmission. The transition from a sliding electrical contact to catenary-free current transmission requires fundamental changes to the overall design of the power supply system primarily due to the different energetic conversion processes needed for an inductive power transmission. However, existing technological limitations, especially power electronics, have a serious impact on the system design. The challenges related to the dimensioning of <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> power supply system, considering technological limitations of today’s equipment are discussed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} opened {{with the line}} in 1876, but the building {{in its current form}} was built in 1878 by the Weimar-Gera Railway Company (Weimar-Geraer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), apart from two changes described below. In 1908, the open staircase {{in the middle of the}} building was replaced by a new central building. In 1981, the supervisory building was added on the platform side of the reception building. The station building was renovated in 2000 and attracted some retail outlets (shops selling magazines, flowers and model trains and several snack bars). The deportation of Jews, Sinti and Romani during the Second World War is commemorated by a flower-decked plaque at <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> entrance of <b>the</b> entrance building.

This gang, although very successful in the criminal underworld, had virtually no experience in stopping and robbing trains. So it was agreed to enlist the help of another London gang called The South Coast Raiders. This group, which included Tommy Wisbey, Bob Welch and Jim Hussey, who were already accomplished train robbers, also included Roger Cordrey - a man who was a specialist in this field and knew how to rig <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> signals to stop the train.

The track was divided lengthwise by a barrier that contained obelisks, temples, statues and lap-counters. The best seats were at <b>the</b> <b>track-side,</b> close to <b>the</b> action; they were reserved for Senators.

30|$|With the {{introduction}} of Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems to high-speed train communications [10], the handover delay could be significantly reduced to less than 1 second [11]. Due to the limited uplink resource and inadequate uplink scheduling, the LTE system may still suffer from frequent handover failures caused by unreliable uplink measurement reports at high mobility. Furthermore, for a train with hundreds of passengers, {{a large amount of}} handover requests in a short time may easily leads to signaling congestions. To address this issue, there are numerous interests in adopting LTE-based mobile relays dedicated for high speed train scenario [12] where user traffics are aggregated by a mobile relay fixed {{on the top of a}} train carriage and then communicated to the track side base stations (BS). The system only needs to maintain one high-mobility link between the mobile relay and <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> BS, e.g. <b>the</b> mobile backhaul, instead of hundreds of individual access links. Mobile relay can reduce the possibility of signaling congestions, but it still requires a large overlapped cell boundary area for smooth handovers.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the long}} {{distance}} to New York City and the fact there was no high-speed electric service, commuter ridership at Riverhead stations, such as Laurel was minimal. Statistics from the winter of 1930 reveal {{that there were no}} daily commuters to western LIRR terminals, and there was no change the following summer. The low numbers at Laurel, forced the railroad to take action.As early as 1925, the LIRR petitioned the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) to allow for the discontinuation of its Laurel station agent. The PSC denied the request on July 14, 1925. Nevertheless, the LIRR won a second request in May 1938 and was allowed to close the Laurel agency. The stipulation was that the company maintain suitable facilities for the receipt of carload and less-than-carload shipments of freight. Since it was a non-agency station, it was placed under control of nearby Mattituck. In the next few months in 1939, the Laurel depot was made into a shelter by boarding up the windows and removing <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> wall. <b>The</b> shed was razed in the year 1967.|$|R
60|$|So {{time went}} by, {{until one day}} Keawe went upon a visit as far as Kailua to certain of his friends. There he was well feasted; and left {{as soon as he}} could the next morning, and rode hard, for he was {{impatient}} to behold his beautiful house; and, besides, the night then coming on was the night in which the dead of old days go abroad in the sides of Kona; and having already meddled with the devil, he was the more chary of meeting with the dead. A little beyond Honaunau, looking far ahead, he was aware of a woman bathing in the edge of the sea; and she seemed a well-grown girl, but he thought no more of it. Then he saw her white shift flutter as she put it on, and then her red holoku; {{and by the time he}} came abreast of her she was done with her toilet, and had come up from the sea, and stood by <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> in her red holoku, and she was all freshened with the bath, and her eyes shone and were kind.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{wireless}} sensors, {{there has been an}} increasing amount of {{research in the area of}} energy harvesting, particularly from vibration, to power these devices. An interesting application is the possibility of harvesting energy from <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> vibration due to a passing train, as this energy could be used to power remote sensors mounted on the track for strutural health monitoring, for example. This paper describes a fundamental study to determine how much energy could be harvested from a passing train. Using a time history of vertical vibration measured on a sleeper, the optimum mechanical parameters of a linear energy harvesting device are determined. Numerical and analytical investigations are both carried out. It is found that the optimum amount of energy harvested per unit mass is proportional to the product of the square of the input acceleration amplitude and the square of the input duration. For the specific case studied, it was found that the maximum energy that could be harvested per unit mass of the oscillator is about 0. 25 J/kg at a frequency of about 17 Hz. The damping ratio for the optimum harvester was found to be about 0. 0045, and the corresponding amplitude of the relative displacement of the mass is approximately 5 mm...|$|R

After the Renault engine in Elio de Angelis's Lotus failed and {{littered}} the racing line at the very fast Jochen Rindt Kurve with slippery oil, the leaders Piquet and Prost came through- Piquet slipped and slid slightly through the corner- but Prost, while trying to hold 4th gear in place spun his car and crashed into <b>the</b> <b>track-side</b> Armco barrier. Lauda, who had passed 3rd placed Patrick Tambay coming out of the Bosch Kurve moved up into 2nd, and then began chasing Piquet; Lauda passed him going into the fastest corner on the track, the Tiroch Kurve. Piquet dropped back with ruined tires, and Lauda slowed down a lot after losing 4th gear in the Texaco Panorama curves. Lauda was able to stay in front of Piquet and become the only Austrian to win his home Grand Prix. Italian Michele Alboreto in a Ferrari finished 3rd.|$|R
