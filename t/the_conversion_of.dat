40|$|In {{order to}} more {{effectively}} control NO emissions in coal-fired flue gas, the denitration reaction {{is carried out}} with simulated industrial boiler flue gas in a fixed bed reactor. The influence of char types, reaction conditions, the composition of flue gas and other factors on <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO are discussed. The result shows that the industrial semi-coke is the most suitable experimental coal in the three coals studied, and the industrial semi-coke particle size of 0. 6 ~ 1  0 mm is relatively suitable; <b>The</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO increases gradually {{with the increase of}} temperature, and when the reaction temperature is 700 ℃ and the space velocity is 10 000 h- 1 , <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO can reach 99 %; <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO decreases gradually as airspeed increases, but the airspeed change has no effect on <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO at 700 ℃; under anaerobic conditions,the change of NO concentration has no effect on <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO; at the same temperature, NO conversion rate is higher at the presence of oxygen compared with that at anaerobic situation, and <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO is the highest when O 2 concentration is 4 %; under aerobic conditions, the concentration change of SO 2 and CO 2 has no effect on <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> NO...|$|R

5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work together for <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> non-Christians within their territories. He urged <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E

40|$|We firstly propose <b>the</b> {{coupling}} <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> bio-derived furans and methanol over ZSM- 5 {{for enhancing}} aromatic production. <b>The</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> bio-derived furans and methanol {{was conducted in}} a continuous fixed bed reactor. 2 -Methylfuran (MF) {{was used as a}} probe molecule to identify the possible reaction pathways. The effects of the methanol to MF molar ratio, reaction temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the product distribution from <b>the</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> MF and methanol were investigated. The experimental results showed that the aromatic yield from <b>the</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> MF and methanol is about 5. 2 times higher than that of the catalytic fast pyrolysis of only MF. In addition, it can also enhance the yield of olefins, the selectivity of xylenes and reduce coke formation. These results indicate that there is a significant synergistic effect between MF and methanol. The synergistic effect could be attributed to the methanol-to-olefins reactions, the Diels-Alder reactions of furans with olefins, and the alkylation reaction of benzene/toluene with methanol occurring during <b>the</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> MF and methanol. The reaction conditions for maximizing the synergistic effect were a methanol to MF molar ratio of 2 at 550 C. Moreover, the comparative study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> different bio-derived furans (MF, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF), furfural (FF) and furfuryl alcohol (FA)) and methanol were also considered in this study. <b>The</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> DMF and methanol exhibited maximum yields of aromatics, olefins and a minimum yield of coke, suggesting that DMF is the best candidate of bio-derived furans for aromatic production in <b>the</b> coupling <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> bio-derived furans and methanol...|$|R
