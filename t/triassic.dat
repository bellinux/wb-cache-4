5|$|Division 2. Order Amiiformes– the relict bowfin, (halecomorphids), {{the only}} extant {{species in the}} order Amiiformes which {{date back to the}} <b>Triassic</b> period.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, these {{characteristics}} were {{not present in}} the <b>Triassic</b> ancestors of the mammals. Nearly all mammaliaforms possess an epipubic bone, the exception being modern placentals.|$|E
5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the <b>Triassic.</b> The largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle <b>Triassic,</b> some 230 million years ago, and wings are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems to have taken place some time during the <b>Triassic.</b> The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may push back the origins of the order to the early Permian period.|$|E
5|$|The {{north-eastern}} {{boundary of}} this geologic region {{is marked by}} the Murihiku escarpment, which runs along {{the southern edge of}} the dormant Hillfoot fault line. The Catlins ranges are strike ridges composed of <b>Triassic</b> and Jurassic sandstones, mudstones and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of feldspar. Fossils of the late and middle <b>Triassic</b> Warepan and Kaihikuan stages are found in the area.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} of reptiles, the diapsids, began to diversify during the <b>Triassic,</b> notably the dinosaurs. By the late Mesozoic, the large labyrinthodont groups that first {{appeared}} during the Paleozoic such as temnospondyls and reptile-like amphibians had gone extinct. All current major groups of sauropsids evolved during the Mesozoic, with birds first appearing in the Jurassic as a derived clade of theropod dinosaurs. Many groups of synapsids such as anomodonts and therocephalians that once comprised the dominant terrestrial fauna of the Permian also became extinct during the Mesozoic; during the <b>Triassic,</b> however, one group (Cynodontia) {{gave rise to the}} descendant taxon Mammalia, which survived through the Mesozoic to later diversify during the Cenozoic.|$|E
5|$|After the Carboniferous {{rainforest}} collapse amphibian dominance {{gave way}} to reptiles, and amphibians were further devastated by the Permian–Triassic extinction event. During the <b>Triassic</b> Period (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians, leading {{to a reduction in}} both the amphibians' size and their importance in the biosphere. According to the fossil record, Lissamphibia, which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early <b>Triassic.</b> The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating, but the most recent molecular study, based on multilocus sequence typing, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin for extant amphibians.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the fossil record of insects is scant, including beetles from the Lower <b>Triassic.</b> However, there are a few exceptions, such as in Eastern Europe. At the Babiy Kamen site in the Kuznetsk Basin, numerous beetle fossils were discovered, including entire specimens of the infraorders Archostemata (e.g. Ademosynidae, Schizocoleidae), Adephaga (e.g., Triaplidae, Trachypachidae) and Polyphaga (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Byrrhidae, Elateroidea). However, species from the families Cupedidae and Schizophoroidae are not present at this site, whereas they dominate at other fossil sites from the Lower <b>Triassic.</b> Further records are known from Khey-Yaga, Russia, in the Korotaikha Basin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Permian (299–252 {{million years}} ago) and <b>Triassic</b> periods, the Variscan orogeny {{resulted}} in the formation of several mountainous areas including Dartmoor in the south, Exmoor and the Quantocks, and the Mendips.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{professional}} animosity, Cope also assigned species to Coelurus; in 1887, he named fossils from the Late <b>Triassic</b> of New Mexico as C. bauri and C. longicollis. He later gave them their own genus, Coelophysis.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} <b>Triassic</b> follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late <b>Triassic</b> and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late <b>Triassic.</b> Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Cicadomorpha first {{appeared}} in the Upper Permian. The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. The Upper Permian Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China. The Upper <b>Triassic</b> Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In the Taunton area Permian (295–250 {{million years}} ago) red {{sandstones}} and breccia outcrop, while rocks of <b>Triassic</b> age (248–204 million years ago) underlie much of Somerset and form the solid geology to the Somerset Moors and Levels.|$|E
5|$|In the Taunton area Permian (299–252 {{million years}} ago) red {{sandstones}} and breccia outcrop, although rocks of <b>Triassic</b> age (252–201 million years ago) underlie much of Somerset and form the solid geology of the Somerset Moors and Levels. There are no glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|Life on Earth {{seemed to}} recover quickly after the Permian extinctions, {{though this was}} mostly {{in the form of}} {{disaster}} taxa such as the hardy Lystrosaurus. Specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity, complex food webs, and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. Current research indicates that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction, which inhibited recovery, and to prolonged environmental stress to organisms that continued into the Early <b>Triassic.</b> Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-Tr extinction, i.e. in the late <b>Triassic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the clade may include Eoraptor from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as Herrerasaurus, Chindesaurus from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and {{possibly}} Caseosaurus from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, Alwalkeria from the Late <b>Triassic</b> Maleri Formation of India, and Teyuwasu, known from very fragmentary remains from the Late <b>Triassic</b> of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted {{that it had been}} incorrectly suggested that Staurikosaurus pricei was a juvenile Herrerasaurus. This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile Herrerasaurus were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of Staurikosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Rugose or horn corals became {{dominant}} by {{the middle}} of the Silurian period, and became extinct early in the <b>Triassic</b> period. The rugose corals existed in solitary and colonial forms, and were also composed of calcite.|$|E
5|$|Some earwig {{specimen}} fossils {{are in the}} extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, {{the former}} dating to the Late <b>Triassic</b> and the latter to the Middle Jurassic. Many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to earwigs, though the icebugs of Grylloblattaria are most likely.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals first {{appeared}} in the Middle <b>Triassic,</b> but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose corals of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times stony corals numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} the area {{consists}} of Permo-Triassic sandstones and particularly <b>Triassic</b> mudstones. These old rocks lie beneath sea-level and are invisible beneath drift made up of glacial till deposits and post-glacial colluvium and alluvium deposits; there is a smaller amount of peat.|$|E
5|$|The dentary {{gradually}} became the main bone {{of the lower}} jaw which, by the <b>Triassic,</b> progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles).|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle <b>Triassic</b> (around 240 million years ago), and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late <b>Triassic.</b> Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the <b>Triassic,</b> about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{soils are}} mostly a strong, brown, dry earth, well adapted for arable farming {{and the growing}} of grains of all kinds {{that contributed to the}} area being a mostly farming community until the modern era. Soils were further enriched over the millennia by alluvial deposits from the River Taff. The bedrock under the whole area is predominantly sandstone, dating from both the Devonian period (Old Red Sandstone) and the <b>Triassic</b> (New Red Sandstone) laid down in arid conditions. These may subsequently have been ground down by the Taff valley glacier during the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. Radyr Stone is a <b>Triassic</b> breccia used widely for decorative work in the Cardiff area, including Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff Docks and in the bridges of the Taff Vale Railway.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by <b>Triassic</b> reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|A single large wing from {{a species}} of Diptera in the <b>Triassic</b> (10mm instead of usual 2–6mm) was found in Australia (Mt. Crosby).This family Tilliardipteridae, despite of the {{numerous}} 'tipuloid' features, {{should be included in}} Psychodomorpha sensu Hennig on account of loss of the convex distal 1A reaching wing margin and formation of the anal loop.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late <b>Triassic</b> tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossils {{have been}} found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica, giving them a nearly {{worldwide}} distribution during the Late <b>Triassic.</b> Many aetosaur remains {{have been found}} from the Chinle Group in the southwestern United States. Most fossils have been found from Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Some remains have also been found from Utah, particularly in Canyonlands National Park and Zion National Park. Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark Supergroup along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They have been found from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been found from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco. During the Late <b>Triassic,</b> Morocco {{would have been in}} close proximity with the Newark Supergroup of North America in the supercontinent of Pangaea. It is also possible that Desmatosuchus was present in Africa, as fossils have been found from the Zarzaitine Series in Algeria that were referred to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{disagree}} as {{to whether}} Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the <b>Triassic</b> proto-frog, Triadobatrachus.|$|E
5|$|Burrow Mump, {{an ancient}} {{earthwork}} {{owned by the}} National Trust, is a natural hill of <b>Triassic</b> sandstone capped by Keuper marl, standing at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. It probably served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of Athelney {{at the end of}} the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late <b>Triassic</b> period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle <b>Triassic</b> strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, <b>Triassic</b> and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was alternately inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Triassic</b> (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment to the surrounding basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among the most basal (primitive) members of the group. Although their fossils are {{relatively}} rare and their group small in numbers, they lived across all continents except Australia and Antarctica for approximately 100 million years, from the Late <b>Triassic</b> to the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Hymenoptera in {{the form}} of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Lower <b>Triassic.</b> Apocrita, wasps in the broad sense, appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; they appear to have evolved from the Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early <b>Triassic,</b> roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the <b>Triassic</b> and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus {{has several}} {{features}} of the head in common with basal theropods such as other ceratosaurs and coelophysoids, but it also convergently shares a number of traits, including the beak and the fused sternum, with the later coelurosaurs. The overall aspect of the animal, including the long neck and legs, {{is very similar to}} that of the Cretaceous ornithomimid theropods, as well as the <b>Triassic</b> non-dinosaurian archosaur Effigia, representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Since 1977, {{the rich}} {{vertebrate}} fauna found at Baden-Württemberg reflect a moist {{region of the}} Middle <b>Triassic</b> in Germany. Along with Batrachotomus, palaeontologists recovered remains of fishes, amphibians, such as Gerrothorax and Mastodonsaurus, and even animals like nothosaurs and the distinct marine reptile Tanystropheus. Flora of the locality consisted of horsetails, ferns, cycads and conifers, suggesting that there was rich vegetation.|$|E
