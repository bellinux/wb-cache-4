40|$|How and why {{parasite}} virulence (<b>terms</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> font {{are in the}} Glossary) evolves are arguably some of {{the most}} important questions addressed by evolutionary biologists. The 1990 s saw rich and abounding research in this area, mostly based on the ‘trade-off hypothesis ’ (Anderson & May, 1982), which states that virulence is an unavoid-able consequence of parasite transmission (see Box 1). In this review, we first briefly outline the seldom-discussed history of virulence evolution. Then, we expose the current debate in the field, which can be summarized as a challenge to the trade-off hypothesis. Finally, to answer this challenge, we discuss the advances made in the past decade and we argue that, in the light of these advances, we need not abandon the trade-off model. Instead, we argue that these new insights ought to b...|$|E
40|$|Countries {{that are}} {{candidates}} for European Union (EU) accession face {{the complex and}} urgent task of building administrative institutions {{so that they can}} fulfil the “Copenhagen criteria”. Such institutions must be able to implement the acquis communautaire within tight budget constraints and ensure favourable conditions for a competitive private sector. They must also provide candidate countries with the institutional capacity to participate effectively in future policy-making within the European Union upon accession. This paper lays out basic principles, tools and issues for building institutions. The target audience includes all those involved in Institution Building within candidate countries, EU Member States, the European Commission and the aid community. The paper highlights the issues associated with building effective institutions while providing concrete examples of how Member States and candidate countries have responded to such challenges.

40|$|This report aims {{to outline}} {{the testing of}} {{object-oriented}} programs. At present there is little research being conducted, covering this area. A review of the current literature in the area is provided. The testing process for object-oriented programs is compared and contrasted with the traditional approach of unit, and integration testing. The change of emphasis for testing from the routines themselves, to the testing {{of the interaction between}} routines via the data-members of a class is achieved by the application of a state-based approach which separately tests the definition and uses of the data-members. This new technique is described, and examples are provided for clarification. This report assumes a basic knowledge of both object-orientation and testing; however, the majority of <b>terms</b> (those <b>in</b> <b>bold)</b> are usually explained in both footnotes (briefly) and in the glossary which appears towards the rear of this document.

40|$|This is for {{students}} with some philosophical background, but we presuppose none in philosophy of language. The philosophy of language aims to answer many questions about language and its nature, some of which are: (1) What is a language? (2) What {{kind of thing is}} meaning? (3) What are the most basic meaningful parts of language and how do they allow us to express more complex things? (4) How is linguistic meaning implicated in communication? (5) What is the source of meaning? (5) How do we come to understand meaningful languages? (6) What governs linguistic rules or norms? Answering these questions is deeply important for understanding our linguistic activities. Philosophers, and linguists, sometimes together, have offered differing theories in response to each of them. For example, with respect to question (1), some believe that a language is a thing unique to an individual – that each of us has our own idiolect. Others believe that languages are public objects shared among individuals who speak the same language. You may see already that how you answer one of these questions determines a lot about how to proceed in studying language, whether at a philosophical or even scientific level. For instance, if we all have individual idiolects, then we ought to focus only on individual speakers in our studies of language. However, if language is something shared, we must focus on the collective understandings of it. Philosophy of language, then, can play a large role in setting the research agenda when we study language. Answers to the remaining questions, among others, compose the rest of this book. Understanding the phenomenon of language is an important endeavor. Linguistic activity is highly complex behavior that animals like us, and possibly others, engage in regularly and easily. Simply understanding how this is made possible would be a great achievement. Studying the nature of language can help us understand what kind of cognitive being is capable of engaging in linguistic activity. It might also impact our knowledge of our evolutionary history (our theories of language must allow for them to have evolved within a certain period of time), our general psychological nature (our theories of how we learn language might also help us understand how we learn other topics, like mathematics, for example), other representational systems (such as economics or art), and potentially the nature of the world we inhabit (language is about the world at first blush, and if so, studying language could shed light on what there is beyond linguistic phenomena). In tackling such a broad topic, {{it is hard to know}} even where to start. We will begin by first studying what a language is, its most basic properties, and how it is structured. This is the topic taken up in the very first section of the book. Though most texts do not start here, for us, it makes the most logical sense. After all, if we failed to have a working understanding of a language in general, the rest of the book would seem to have little point, and would make little sense. For this reason, it is not until our second section that we begin studying the phenomenon of meaning in earnest. In this section, we not only give a characterization of the general functions a theory of meaning ought to fill, we also offer a first pass at what meaning at an abstract level could be, and we distinguish the phenomenon of meaning from other related phenomena. Now that we understand what a language is, what a theory of meaning is, and what meanings might be, we need a grasp of where these meanings might come from, and how we might come to know them. This is the topic of the third section of the text. While you might skip this section and instead read the fourth one first, we do not recommend reading either of the last two sections without having read the first two. Finally, in the fourth section, we address various specific theories of what meanings are, one by one. Here are a few points to note about chapter structures. Each chapter has technical <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> and then shortly thereafter defines them. Furthermore, each chapter also gives a list of main points to remember, as well as a list of suggested readings, some of which are directly relied on in the text, but others of which readers may simply wish to explore, and so their length varies from chapter to chapter. There is naturally some unevenness to this feature of the text, as some chapters rely heavily on technical notions and others less so. Some topics are easier to summarize than others, and therefore, the points to remember sections vary in their detail and length as well. It should be noted that you cannot get the thrust of the arguments by merely relying on these points to remember sections. They are not so intended. They are intended merely to serve as memory prompts, not comprehensive summaries. We have not gone the conventional route in how the book is organized. It is not organized historically, nor is its organization author or puzzle-based. A few reasons for this are that (1) the history of philosophy of language does not neatly address separate topics as such and therefore is highly confusing, (2) the same would be true if the book were organized according to author, (3) puzzles about philosophy of language are only truly gripping once one has some background in philosophy of language, and (4) its organization, starting with a broader focus, reflects the current state of concerns in the philosophy of language. At this point, philosophy of language is more focused on abstract topics than on giving any particular theory of the nature of meaning itself. While the content of the original book has been maintained, it occurs in different places now, and involves putting it within a more contemporary context. Some discussions have also been significantly expanded, such as the discussion of Chomsky, and the discussion of the difficulties of providing a compositional semantics. In addition, some chapters are entirely new. For example, the chapter on propositions, the chapter on Montague, and the two chapters that were added by Melissa Ebbers on two different theories of in the last section. Even some topics are entirely new, such as the topics covered in section three of the book. In general, the book’s content has been significantly reorganized, and significantly expanded in order to accommodate developments in the area of philosophy of language since it was first published...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, the {{synthesis}} of DNA has been a tedious, time consuming, expensive and experimentally challenging task. But advances in automated instrumentation and improved chemistry have now {{made it possible to}} make any moderate-length sequence of DNA in any quantity. The ease of automated chemical synthesis of DNA has triggered a whole new industry of low-cost DNA suppliers around the globe. The convenience of ordering DNA sequence by mail has opened new avenues in research both in academia and in the healthcare products developed by pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, these advances have made it theoretically possible to synthesize DNA {{that could be used to}} do harm. This article aims to describe the first stages of DNA synthesis, from readily available raw materials to medium-sized segments with a desired sequence (oligonucleotides), and examines whether there are points at which such activities could be, for example, monitored or controlled. Some academic and commercial applications of DNA synthesis require the construction of very small quantities of the desired sequence; others involve synthesis at the gram scale or larger. I provide comments on possible intervention points for both types of application. <b>Terms</b> shown <b>in</b> <b>bold</b> are defined <b>in</b> the glossary.
