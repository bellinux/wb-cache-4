5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of periglacial landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each {{side of the}} porch is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E

That evening, an impressive typhoon attacks the ship. Lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with a musket.

500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

The rock is actually the visible above-ground part of a segmented ridge, the surface expression of a large igneous batholith, called the Town Mountain Granite of middle Precambrian (...) material that intruded into earlier metamorphic schist, called the Packsaddle Schist. The intrusive granite of the rock mass, or pluton, was exposed by extensive erosion of the surrounding sedimentary rock, primarily the Cretaceous Edwards limestone, which is exposed a few {{miles to the south}} of Enchanted Rock.|$|E
2500|$|In Sir Henry Taylor's play, Edwin the Fair (1842), the {{character}} Earl Athulf {{was based on}} Elliot. Taylor also mentioned Elliot in his poem, [...] "Heroism in the Shade" [...] (1845). Elliot was made Knight Commander of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1856. He died in retirement at Withycombe Raleigh, Exmouth, Devon, England, on 9 September 1875. He is buried in the churchyard of St John-in-the-Wilderness, Exmouth. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> headstone inscription to his grave reads in worn lead lettering [...] "To the memory of/Adm Sir Charles Elliot KCB/Born 15th August 1801/Died 9th September 1875/The souls of the righteous {{are in the hands}} of God".

2500|$|The {{dark brown}} colours of <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> upper layers give {{the name to}} the Brown (or Middle) Jurassic. The colours {{are a result of}} highly {{concentrated}} iron. The layer of the Dogger which is 135m thick forms the main part of Hesselberg's slopes. The lowest sub-layer (Dogger alpha) is formed of 75m thick Opalinus-clay. The soil of these layers is very susceptible to landslides which has resulted in the unevenness of the meadows. On top of the Opalinus-clay lies a layer of iron sandstone (Dogger beta), which is 40m thick. This layer is very distinctive due to its steep rise. Because the Opalinus-clay layer is impervious to water, a spring horizon has formed at the transition to the iron sandstone. The layers of Dogger gamma (Sowerbyi layers) (1 m), Dogger delta (Ostreen-lime) (4m), and Dogger epsilon (Oolith-lime) (2m) are summarised under the term [...] "ooliths". These layers contain many fossils. On {{the very top of the}} Middle Jurassic layers is the Ornate's clay layer (Dogger zeta), which is only 2m thick. This small layer forms a terrace around the Hesselberg. On its southern side the buildings of the folk high school were constructed.|$|E
50|$|On May 20, 2010, Dish Network {{announced}} that it was dropping <b>The</b> <b>Weather</b> Channel at midnight ET that day in favor of its own similar <b>weather</b> information channel, <b>The</b> <b>Weather</b> Cast. <b>The</b> switch was due to high rates that <b>The</b> <b>Weather</b> Channel demanded Dish Network to pay (<b>The</b> <b>Weather</b> Channel requested a rate increase from 11 cents per subscriber per month to 12 cents).
