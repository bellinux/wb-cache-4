25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> {{for such}} reform {{stemmed from the}} {{intrusion}} of modernism. The cultural stream of interest and invention coming from the Christian Europeans caused many Muslims {{to search for a}} proper and adequate response. Merely to learn the foreign ways risked becoming alienated from one's own people and faith, yet modern science and technology, and perhaps government and social culture also, were becoming an ever-increasing challenge. The desire to reform appeared across the Muslim world, among the Ottomans and among the more remote Iranians and Mughals, as well as the Arabs. If {{for no other reason than}} the performance of European armies and fleets, these modern ways were necessary to master. Devout Muslims realized that a proper place must be located in their tradition for this wealth of the new.|$|E

Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing [...] "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was [...] "a funny paradox" [...] and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi.|$|E

They also liked <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> brought about with the logic chess, and called the game's use of sound effects excellent. AsbelGrants at Jeuxvideo.com called Ace Attorney Investigations 2 the best entry in the series, saying that the plot and characters were the game's highlights, keeping the player in suspense until the end. They found the first episode surprisingly strong, {{as it was a}} [...] "long and exciting case" [...] compared to other Ace Attorney games' tutorial-like first episodes. They noted how the gameplay was mostly the same as in Ace Attorney Investigations, but did not consider this a problem as they thought it had the best type of investigations in the series, and they enjoyed the implementation of the logic chess feature. They enjoyed the music, calling it memorable.|$|E

500|$|This {{painting}} exemplifies Lichtenstein's {{use of the}} background/foreground {{shift and}} ironic colloquialisms in critical commands. Although most of Lichtenstein's war imagery depicts American war themes, this depicts [...] "a scarred German submarine captain at a battle station". The manner of depiction with the commander's face pressed against the periscope reflects fusions of industrial art of the 1920s and 1930s. [...] The ironic aspect of this in 1963 is {{in part due to}} its temporal displacement referring back to World War II during the much later period of the Cold War. The styling of the balloon content, especially that of the large font characters, is complemented by or complementary to the other traditional visual content of the painting. Lichtenstein's alterations heightened <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in the image, however, they also offset that menace by forming a detached work. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that {{this was one of the}} [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.|$|E

2500|$|The arrival on February 13 {{of rumors}} that a {{preliminary}} peace agreement {{had been reached}} in Paris heightened <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> among the nationalists.

[...] Washington responded that he sympathized both with the plight of his officers and men and with those in Congress, but that he would not use the army to threaten the civil government. [...] Washington believed such a course of action would violate the principles of republicanism for which they had all been fighting. [...] It was unclear to the Congressional nationalists whether Knox, who had been a regular supporter of army protests to Congress, would play a role in any sort of staged action.

2500|$|The Oregon years saw an {{increased}} emphasis on Rajneesh's prediction that the world might be destroyed by nuclear war or other disasters sometime in the 1990s. Rajneesh had said as early as 1964 that [...] "the third and last war {{is now on the}} way" [...] and frequently spoke of the need to create a [...] "new humanity" [...] to avoid global suicide. This now became the basis for a new exclusivism, and a 1983 article in the Rajneesh Foundation Newsletter announcing that [...] "Rajneeshism is creating a Noah's Ark of consciousness... I say to you that except this there is no other way", increased <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in building the Oregon commune. In March 1984, Sheela announced that Rajneesh had predicted the death of two-thirds of humanity from AIDS. Sannyasins were required to wear rubber gloves and condoms if they had sex, and to refrain from kissing, measures widely represented in the press as an extreme over-reaction since condoms were not usually recommended for AIDS prevention because AIDS was considered a homosexual disease at that stage.|$|E
2500|$|Yoav Fromer, {{writing in}} The Washington Post, thanked Iron Dome {{for the lack}} of {{fatalities}} and the relatively low casualty rate among Israeli civilians, and said that the technology appears to provide [...] "both a physical and a psychological solace that enables Israelis to go about their business." [...] However, in his view, over time, Iron Dome may do the Israeli public more harm than good because despite the fact it is a [...] "tactical miracle" [...] it may help create a serious strategic problem to Israelis' long-term security because, by temporarily minimizing the dangers posed by rocket attacks, it distracts Israelis from seeking a broader regional political solution that could finally make systems such as Iron Dome unnecessary. [...] In Fromer's view, the Israeli government is [...] "not exactly brimming with creative ideas to reignite the peace process with the Palestinians. And with Iron Dome, why would it? As long as the Israeli public believes it is safe, for now, under the soothing embrace of technology, it will not demand that its political leaders wage diplomacy to end violence that mandated Iron Dome in the first place. Since Iron Dome has transformed a grim reality into a rather bearable ordeal, Israelis have lost <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and outrage that might have pushed their government" [...] to make necessary concessions in exchange for peace. [...] In Fromer's view, Israelis risk confusing the short-term military advantage provided by Iron Dome with the long term need for an original and comprehensive diplomatic solution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} global {{serializability}} {{has been a}} quite intensively researched subject in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Commitment ordering (CO) has provided an effective general solution to the problem, insight into it, and understanding about possible generalizations of strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which practically and almost exclusively has been utilized (in conjunction with the Two-phase commit protocol (2PC) [...] ) since the 1980s to achieve global serializability across databases. An important side-benefit of CO is the automatic global deadlock resolution that it provides (this is applicable also to distributed SS2PL; though global deadlocks have been an important research subject for SS2PL, automatic resolution has been overlooked, except in the CO articles, until today (2009)). At that time quite many commercial database system types existed, many non-relational, and databases were relatively very small. Multi database systems were considered a key for database scalability by database systems interoperability, and global serializability was urgently needed. Since then the tremendous progress in computing power, storage, and communication networks, resulted in orders of magnitude increases in both centralized databases' sizes, transaction rates, and remote access to database capabilities, as well as blurring the boundaries between centralized computing and distributed one over fast, low-latency local networks (e.g., Infiniband). These, together with progress in database vendors' distributed solutions (primarily the popular SS2PL with 2PC based, a de facto standard that allows interoperability among different vendors' (SS2PL-based) databases; both SS2PL and 2PC technologies have gained substantial expertise and efficiency), workflow management systems, and database replication technology, in most cases have provided satisfactory and sometimes better information technology solutions without multi database atomic distributed transactions over databases with different concurrency control (bypassing the problem above). As a result, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> that existed with the problem at that period, and in general with high-performance distributed atomic transactions over databases with different concurrency control [...] types, has reduced. However, the need in concurrent distributed atomic transactions as a fundamental element of reliability exists in distributed systems also beyond database systems, and so the need in global serializability as a fundamental correctness criterion for such transactional systems (see also Distributed serializability in Serializability). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), and sophisticated systems management the need for effective global serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications seems to increase, and thus also the need in Commitment ordering (including the popular for databases special case SS2PL; SS2PL, though, {{does not meet the}} requirements of many other transactional objects).|$|E
