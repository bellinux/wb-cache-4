25|$|Organic cofactors {{may have}} been present even earlier {{in the history of}} life on Earth. The {{nucleotide}} adenosine is present in cofactors that catalyse many basic metabolic reactions such as methyl, acyl, and phosphoryl group transfer, as well as redox reactions. This ubiquitous chemical scaffold has, therefore, been proposed to be a remnant of the RNA world, with early ribozymes evolving <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>a</b> restricted set of nucleotides and related compounds. Adenosine-based cofactors are thought to have acted as interchangeable adaptors that allowed enzymes and ribozymes <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> new cofactors through small modifications in existing adenosine-binding domains, which had originally evolved <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>a</b> different cofactor. This process of adapting a pre-evolved structure for a novel use is known as exaptation.|$|R
