It is proposed to form a union for commercial purposes--to altogether abolish the frontier <b>tariff</b> <b>line,</b> with its double sets of custom house officials now existing between the two countries, and to agree upon one tariff for both, the proceeds of this tariff to be divided between the two governments on the basis of population. It is said that {{a large proportion of the}} merchants of Canada are in favor of this step, as they believe it would materially add to the business of the country, by removing the restrictions that now exist on trade between Canada and the States. Those persons who are opposed to the measure believe that it would increase the material welfare or the country, but it would loosen the bonds between Canada and England; and this sentiment overrides the desire for commercial prosperity. Whether the sentiment can continue to bear the strain put upon it is a question. It is thought by many that commercial considerations must in the end prevail. It seems also to be generally agreed that such a zollverein, or common customs union, would bring practically more benefits to the Canadian provinces than to the United States. (It seems to me a certainty of time, sooner or later, that Canada shall form two or three grand States, equal and independent, with the rest of the American Union.

40|$|We use two {{alternative}} approaches {{to analyze the}} trade restrictiveness of the Canadian and EU import tariff structures for agricultural goods. The first involves direct, detailed calculations at the <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> level of summary protection indexes. We compare the newer method of welfare and import equivalent indexes to the standard trade weighted method of aggregation. The second approach involves indirect index calculations, where we map tariff data into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, and then use the model to generate the summary. Each approach has its advantages. The direct <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> approach reflects sector detail more comprehensively, but misses the sector and regional linkages captured by the CGE model. As an empirical illustration we simulate the impact of market access liberalization proposed in the WTO draft modality paper of February 2008. Pursuant to a tiered formula, we reduce bound and applied tariffs at the 6 -digit <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> level. We find that the direct <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> approach and the hybrid <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> CGE approach yield similar results. These indicate that access to Canada's agricultural sector is particularly restricted for milk imports from high-income countries. In contrast, developing countries have particular difficulty accessing the EU's Single Market, where high trade restrictions on beef, sugar, and rice are most relevant.

40|$|Trade {{policy is}} defined at the <b>tariff</b> <b>line.</b> Yet most {{analyses}} of trade liberalization are conducted {{at a much}} more aggregated level. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are universally susceptible {{to the problem of}} policy aggregation. Moreover, these models become increasingly irrelevant as policy negotiations intensify into sensitive sectors. At this level of detail, countries employ a mix of standard and nonstandard policies at very disaggregate levels, which are not well represented in current CGE analyses. ^ Further commitments to liberalize trade in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) will be implemented at the <b>tariff</b> <b>line.</b> Hence, from a practical standpoint, it is important that future CGE-based analyses be able to accurately represent trade policy options at this level. The purpose of this thesis is to extend CGE analysis to the <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> in selected sectors by developing a detailed, econometrically estimated, <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> sub-sector model and embedding this in a global CGE framework. In doing so, this thesis will improve our understanding of the effects of agricultural border policies that are defined and negotiated at the <b>tariff</b> <b>line.</b> ^ A case-study approach is adopted focusing on the heavily protected U. S. dairy sector which contains a number of tariff-rate quotas, complex administration methods, high Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs and preferentially applied tariff rates. A mixed-complementarity formulated sub-sector model calibrated to 2001 policy levels in U. S. dairy represents bilateral and multilateral trade policy at the <b>tariff</b> <b>line.</b> Equilibrium outcomes in the sub-sector model are iteratively introduced in a modified CGE model tracking liberalization results from dairy reforms. The analysis examines a comprehensive set of TRQ reform options viz á viz over-quota tariff reductions, quota expansion, simultaneous liberalization as well as competition for and expansion of the global, MFN quota. ^ The results suggest that the path of dairy trade liberalization in the U.

The total value of imports from LDCs has been increasing, but the imports granted both zero tariffs and substantial preference margins over non-LDC countries were not successful.

40|$|The author {{presents}} a tariff index that uses constant-elasticity-of-substitution aggregators of <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> data to calculate how preferential tariff reductions affect both prices and average tariff rates. A simple general-equilibrium model with sector-specific {{factors of production}} can be combined with the tariff indices to calculate how a preferential trade arrangement affects sectoral output, factor prices, and general welfare. The general equilibrium model is simple enough {{that it can be}} calculated on an Excel spreadsheet, and is flexible enough to be used with different ranges of available domestic data. The author {{presents a}}n example of the model, simulating the effects of free trade agreements between Chile and MERCOSUR countries and between Chile and NAFTA countries. Calculations for the case of Chile show that the index is simple to calculate because of its recursive structure, which allows large amounts of detailed <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> data to be aggregated for use with domestic production data that is available only at a more aggregated level. The author finds that results using the tariff aggregators may differ substantially from those derived using simpler averages of tariff reductions. Reductions in import prices using the index were 10 to 30 percent larger than those calculated using a simple average of tariffs. Ignoring the information available in <b>tariff</b> <b>line</b> data could lead to a substantial overestimate of the average tariff rate on imports after a preferential reduction. The tariff index could be extended to incorporate the role of quantitative restrictions. The general equilibrium model could be usedto consider the effects on domestic production of allowing reallocation of capital between industries over time.

40|$|The WTO {{negotiations}} {{dragged on}} for over seven years because of the divergent interests of the WTO members. Even among the developed countries, the United States (US) has different interests compared to the European Union (EU). The US is aggressively demanding for significant reduction in tariffs. Compared to the US, the EU is unable to lower its tariffs drastically because further tariff reductions will erode border protection for some of its important agricultural products. In this study, EU agricultural products are examined by <b>tariff</b> <b>lines</b> at eight digit level to reveal the sensitive agricultural products in the EU. These products are butter, skim milk powder, beef meat, poultry meat, pig meat, white sugar, wheat, barley, and maize. A spreadsheet model is used as an analysis tool to complement the various modelling approaches in identifying the sensitive agricultural products of the EU. The spreadsheet projection model is a simple forecasting model that uses a set of projection values from other models to predict possible outcomes. The sensitivity of EU agricultural products is analysed with various exchange rates (USD 0. 90 per Euro to USD 1. 50 per Euro), different tariff reduction formulas (according to the EU proposal, WTO draft proposal, and US proposal), and the scale limits in the Draft formula and US formula. Out of the many proposals submitted to the WTO for the tariff reduction formula, the US proposal is the most extreme and the EU proposal is the most lenient with the G- 20 proposal and the WTO draft proposal being in the middle. It is natural that the EU proposal will generate a lower number of sensitive products compared to the WTO draft proposal, and the US proposal will generate {{the highest number of}} sensitive products. The results demonstrate that cereals such as wheat, barley, and maize are the most resilient to the erosion of border protection due to further reduction in tariffs in the projected Doha Round. In contrast, poultry meat has the weakest border protection in the projected Doha Round. The examined EU agricultural products are very sensitive to the fluctuations of exchange rate. In the projected Doha Round, there are no sensitive agricultural products in the EU if the Euro is very weak - USD 0. 90 per Euro. On the contrary, a very strong Euro (USD 1. 50 per Euro) will create the highest amount of sensitive products in the projected Doha Round. WTO members are entitled to select and designate an appropriate number of sensitive products. Proposals have extended from as little as one percent to as much as fifteen percent of <b>tariff</b> <b>lines.</b> The EU has proposed eight percent of the <b>tariff</b> <b>lines</b> to be designated as sensitive products in contrast to the proposal for only one percent by the US and G- 20 group.

40|$|Market access {{has been}} at the core of eight {{negotiating}} rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet, agricultural trade remains a heavily protected sector, characterized by higher tariffs relative to industrial goods, large tariff dispersions, numerous specific tariffs and systems of tariff-rate-quotas. This has made the analysis of trade liberalization a formidable task among policy analysts. Previous studies of agricultural trade liberalization have used partial or general equilibrium models of trade. However, each of these modeling strategies has their drawbacks. General equilibrium (GE) models have been criticized because they face serious aggregation issues and miss much of the policy detail that occurs at the <b>tariff</b> <b>line.</b> Partial equilibrium (PE) models on the other hand are often more disaggregated but lack internal consistency and have nothing to say about the economy-wide effects from trade reform. The {{purpose of this paper is}} threefold. One, we develop a methodology that combines PE and GE modeling techniques permitting us to extend GE to the <b>tariff</b> <b>line.</b> Two, we introduce a fully disaggregated U. S. dairy sector and compare PE and GE liberalization results from global dairy reform, thereby offering some insight into the potential errors implicit in current GE studies. Finally, we illustrate how our methodology allows for an explicit treatment of tariff rate quotas in the U. S. dairy sector on a bilateral basis for narrowly defined product lines. agricultural trade, mixed-complementarity problem, partial equilibrium, general equilibrium, Doha Development Agenda, WTO, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries, F 01, F 17, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|E
