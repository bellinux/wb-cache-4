5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> in 2005.|$|E

All <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> (initial body weight 5. 0 - 6. 1 kg) in the floating net cages changed into males {{by the end of}} the experiment, while the smaller ones (initial body weight 4. 5 - 5. 2 kg) remained female. The fastest sex change was in cage 1 where <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> had atretic oocytes one month after stocking and was milting after four months. In the other cages, milt production in <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> was observed 6 - 10 months after stocking. In the tank-reared groupers, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>fish</b> (initial body weight 6. 4 kg) in the tank with four fishes was found to be milting about two months after stocking while the smaller fishes (initial body weight 3. 4 - 4. 0 kg) were still females. The fishes started to spawn two months later. In another tank that was stocked with two females, no sex change was observed in <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> even 16 months after stocking. These results indicate that female groupers can be sexually changed into male by social control at the shortest period of four months in floating net cages and two months in tanks. However, there may be cases wherein sex change will not occur...|$|R

He estimates the cost at US$7 billion. As of December 2005, he had spent US$400,000 of personal money, and raised US$1 million in donations. In December 2006, the New York Times reported that he continued to have that goal. Lynch's book, Catching <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process. Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008. He told a reporter, [...] "In life, he revolutionised the lives of millions of people.... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions of people who will know and understand what the Maharishi has done."

2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Shashanka's kingdom, the Bengal region {{was in a state}} of anarchy. There was no central authority, and there was {{constant}} struggle between petty chieftains. The contemporary writings describe this situation as matsya nyaya ("fish justice" [...] i.e. a situation where <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>fish</b> eat the small fish). Gopala ascended the throne as the first Pala king during these times. The Khalimpur copper plate suggests that the prakriti (people) of the region made him the king. Taranatha, writing nearly 800 years later, also writes that he was democratically elected by the people of Bengal. However, his account is in form of a legend, and is considered historically unreliable. The legend mentions that after a period of anarchy, the people elected several kings in succession, all of whom were consumed by the Naga queen of an earlier king on the night following their election. Gopal, however managed to kill the queen and remained on the throne. The historical evidence indicates that Gopala was not elected directly by his citizens, but by a group of feudal chieftains. Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region.|$|E
