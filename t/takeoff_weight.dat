5|$|The final {{iteration}} of the Yer-2 {{series was}} a 1941 production aircraft re-engined with ACh-30BF engines and redesignated as the Yer-4. It had a slightly larger wingspan, increased <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> and improved armament. The prototype was tested in December 1943, {{but did not}} enter production.|$|E

The F-4's nine external hardpoints have a capability of up to 18,650 pounds (8,480kg) of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and unguided, guided, and thermonuclear weapons. Like other interceptors of its day, the F-4 was designed without an internal cannon.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} E-0 series {{were built}} in small numbers. Fitted with Jumo 211 A-1 engines loaded with retractable radiators and exhaust systems. The variant could carry 1,700kg (3,748lb) of bombs, giving it a <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> of 10,300kg (22,707lbs). The development team for the Jumo 211 A-1 engines managed to increase engine power to , subsequently the He 111 E-1s bomb load capacity increased to 2,000kg (4,410lb) and {{a top speed of}} 242mph (390km/h).|$|E
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was {{the first}} model produced, a total of 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Following the -100SR, Boeing {{produced}} the -100BSR, a 747SR variant with increased <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> capability. Debuting in 1978, the -100BSR also incorporated structural modifications {{for a high}} cycle-to-flying hour ratio; a related standard -100B model debuted in 1979. The -100BSR first flew on November 3, 1978, with first delivery to All Nippon Airways (ANA) on December 21, 1978. A total of twenty -100BSRs were produced for ANA and JAL. The -100BSR had a 600,000lb MTOW and was powered by the same JT9D-7A or General Electric CF6-45 engines used on the -100SR. ANA operated this variant on domestic Japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in March 2006.|$|E

5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater fuel capacity. The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight.</b> These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice {{the thrust of the}} Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised Zveno-SPB (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which {{consisted}} of a Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN mothership and two Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 fighters. Each of the fighters was armed {{with a pair of}} 250kg (550lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs. Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100kg (220lb) of bombs, once hoisted in the air by the TB-3 it could reach 410km/h (220 knots, 255mph) at 2500 m (8,200ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310ft), and could dive at up to 650km/h (350 knots, 405mph). Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> of 22000kg (48,500lb), a top speed of 268km/h (145 knots, 165mph), and a range of 2500km (1,350 NM, 1,550mi). The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.|$|E

5000|$|The Learjet 40XR is an {{upgraded}} version introduced in October, 2004, offering higher <b>takeoff</b> <b>weights,</b> faster cruise speeds and faster time-to-climb rates {{as compared to}} the LJ40. The increases are due to the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration. These are the [...] "BR" [...] engines. LJ40 owners can upgrade their aircraft through the incorporation of several service bulletins.|$|R
5|$|The P-4 {{contained}} {{many changes}} from the P-2 and P-3. The jettisonable loads {{were capable of}} considerable variation. Two external SC 1800kg (3,960lb) bombs, two LMA air-dropped anti-shipping mines, one SC 1,800kg plus four SC 250kg; or one SC 2,500kg external bomb could be carried on an ETC Rüstsatz rack. Depending on the load variation, an 835 L fuel and 120 L oil tank could be added {{in place of the}} internal bomb bay. The armament consisted of three defensive MG 15 machine guns. later supplemented by a further three MG 15s and one MG 17 machine gun. The radio communications were standard FuG X(10), Peil G V direction finding and FuBI radio devices. Due to the increase in defensive firepower, the crew numbers increased from four to five. The empty weight of the P-4 increased to 6,775kg (14,936lb), and the full <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight</b> increased to 13,500kg (29,762lb) owing to the mentioned alterations.|$|E
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its <b>takeoff</b> <b>weight.</b> Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E
