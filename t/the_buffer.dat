40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>The</b> <b>buffered</b> failure {{probability}} {{is an alternative}} measure of reliability that offers several theoretical, practical, and computational advantages over the traditional {{failure probability}}. It is handled with relative ease in design optimization problems, accounts for the degree of violation of a performance threshold, and is more conservative than the failure probability. This paper examines the difference between <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> failure probability and the failure probability in several examples and find that <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> failure probability typically overestimates the failure probability of a structure with a factor of three. We examine the use of <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> failure probability in reliability-based optimal design and present three algorithms for {{the solution of the}} resulting optimization problems. Computational results on six engineering design examples indicate that the problems are solvable in few seconds using standard optimization solvers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the rendezvous problem is to construct a method that enables a population of agents {{to agree on a}} spatial (and possibly temporal) meeting location. We introduce <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> gossip algorithm as a general solution to the rendezvous problem in a discrete domain with direct communication between decentralized agents. We compare the performance of <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> gossip algorithm against the well known uniform gossip algorithm. We believe that a buffered solution is preferable to an unbuffered solution, such as the uniform gossip algorithm, because the use of a buffer allows an agent to use multiple information sources when determining its desired rendezvous point, and that access to multiple information sources may improve agent decision making by reinforcing or contradicting an initial choice. To show that <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> gossip algorithm is an actual solution for the rendezvous problem, we construct a theoretical proof of convergence and derive the conditions under which <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> gossip algorithm is guaranteed to produce a consensus on rendezvous location. We use these results to verify that the uniform gossip algorithm also solves the rendezvous problem. We then use a multi-agent simulation to conduct a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance between <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> and uniform gossip algorithms. Our results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> gossip algorithm can solve the rendezvous problem faster than the uniform gossip algorithm; however, the relative performance between these two solutions depends on the specific constraints of the problem and the parameters of <b>the</b> <b>buffered</b> gossip algorithm...|$|R
50|$|With no signal applied, due to {{the current}} mirrors Q3/Q4 & Q5/Q6, the {{collector}} currents of Q4 and Q6 will be equal in magnitude if the collector currents of Q1 and Q2 are also equal in magnitude. Thus, no current will flow into <b>the</b> <b>buffer's</b> input (or equivalently no voltage will be present at <b>the</b> <b>buffer's</b> input). In practice, due to device mismatches the collector currents are unequal and this results in the difference flowing into <b>the</b> <b>buffer's</b> input resulting in an offset at its output.

5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. <b>The</b> <b>buffer</b> capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acidâ€“base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

Again, Americaâ€™s shift towards interdiction also failed, and the Johnson administration was forced to change the priority of the bombing campaign.
