500|$|As governor, Johnson {{followed}} a strict small-government approach. According to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett, [...] "Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always {{was to ask}} if government {{should be involved in}} that to begin with." [...] He vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in office—a national record of 47% of all legislation—and used the line-item veto on most remaining bills. [...] In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget. [...] In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a repeal of <b>the</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> tax, a $47 million income tax cut, and a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed. During the November 1995 federal government shutdown, he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget. Although Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending, in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third. [...] When drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement, Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchers—a key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor.|$|E

[...] Former Editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, [...] has stated that [...] "It's time to take the Food and Drug Administration back from the drug companies.... In effect, the user fee act put the FDA on the payroll of the industry it regulates.

2500|$|Medicaid {{provided}} the largest portion of federal {{money spent on}} health care for people living with HIV/AIDS until the implementation of Medicare Part D when <b>the</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> costs for those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid shifted to Medicare. [...] Unless low income people who are HIV positive meet some other eligibility category, they {{are not eligible for}} Medicaid assistance unless they can qualify under the [...] "disabled" [...] category to receive Medicaid assistance — as, for example, if they progress to AIDS (T-cell count drops below 200). The Medicaid eligibility policy contrasts with the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) guidelines which recommend therapy for all patients with T-cell counts of 350 or less, or in certain patients commencing at an even higher T-cell count. [...] Due to the high costs associated with HIV medications, many patients are not able to begin antiretroviral treatment without Medicaid help. [...] More than half of people living with AIDS in the US are estimated to receive Medicaid payments. Two other programs that provide financial assistance to people living with HIV/AIDS are the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income.|$|E
