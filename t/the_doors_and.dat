5|$|By 14 March 2012, all {{elevated}} {{stations have}} been retrofitted with <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> are operational. These doors prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas. Under the Rapid Transit Systems Act, acts such as smoking, eating or drinking in stations and trains, {{the misuse of}} emergency equipment and trespassing on the railway tracks are illegal, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The Sognsvann Line was {{finished}} upgraded to metro standard on 7 January 1993, allowing the first T1000 trains to operate through the Common Tunnel into the western network, converting {{parts of the}} Oslo Tramway to metro. The Røa Line {{was finished}} on 19 November 1995, allowing all trains from the east to operate through the city center. To have sufficient metro-compatible trains, six two-car T2000 units were bought, and during the mid-1990s {{were considered to be}} a possible replacement for the T1000s. Starting in 1995, Oslo Sporveier made an interior and livery upgrade to the T1000 trains. The main red color to the exterior was kept, but <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> around the windows were painted blue. The lights and seats were changed, and the latter colored gray. The interior walls were painted red at the end, white on the sides, blue on <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> received yellow hand bars.|$|E
5|$|The Turk {{made its}} debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen {{addressed}} the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> drawers of the cabinet, allowing {{members of the audience}} to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.|$|E
60|$|She {{knocked at}} <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was no}} answer. She tried <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> it {{resisted}} her from the inside. The sullen, unmanageable Norah was locked in.|$|R
6000|$|... [A {{knock at}} <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> MAIRE BRUIN opens {{it and then}} takes a sod of [...] turf out of the hearth in the tongs and passes it through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> [...] closes <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> remains {{standing}} by it.|$|R
60|$|Will set his teeth, {{and marched}} up to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> struck {{it like a}} man {{delivering}} a challenge. Kinney opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> started back in fear when he saw who it was.|$|R
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> wall plate.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows to the house were shut, except for {{the window in the}} main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's true! Him again, dear Mrs Flintwinch,' {{cried the}} stranger. 'Open <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{let me take}} my dear friend Jeremiah to my arms! Open <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> let me hasten myself to embrace my Flintwinch!' ...|$|R
60|$|Pillingshot walked silently to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{flung it}} open. He {{looked up and}} down the passage. Then he closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{returned}} to <b>the</b> table, where he took from his waistcoat-pocket a used match.|$|R
6000|$|After {{stepping}} carefully round it, Francis {{took his}} post round the angle close to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> waited. Presently he heard footsteps approaching--three knocks were given on <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> a voice within asked, [...] "Who is there?" ...|$|R
5|$|Each train {{runs with}} a three-person crew: two {{operators}} control the train {{from the cab}} at {{the front end of}} the train and handle related operations, while a third crew member is the Customer Service Ambassador. Stationed in a designated car in the middle of each train, the Customer Service Ambassador operates <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> wheelchair ramp, makes station stop announcements, and is dedicated to assisting customers on board. Bombardier Transportation is responsible for providing train operations, taking over from CN crews in 2007 and CP crews in 2015. GO trains achieve on-time performance of approximately 95%, and a refund will be provided if a train is more than 15 minutes late, with some conditions.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Simpson {{family has}} barricaded all <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows {{except for the}} back door, which Homer forgot to do. Several zombies break into the house: Homer sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape, but the zombies leave him when they realize {{he does not have}} enough brains for them to eat. Lisa realizes that the school library must have a book that can reverse the spell. The Simpsons arrive at the Springfield Elementary library and Bart casts the {{appropriate}} counter spell, causing all zombies to return to their graves.|$|E
6000|$|The latter opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{said to his}} wife: [...] "My dear, I {{have brought}} an old friend up to see you;" [...] and as Harry entered he closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{went down to the}} library again.|$|R
60|$|So {{the four}} captains betook {{themselves}} to the porch, two of them seating themselves on the little bench {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> two of them on the little bench {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> lighted their pipes.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{knock at}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> it was {{immediately}} opened. They both turned round. It was Stella who stood there. She looked at them both for a moment in surprise. Then she closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> came into <b>the</b> room.|$|R
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of each wing have separate uses. In {{the west wing}} is the baptistry, in the north is the main altar, the main entrance and a notary area, separated by inside corner walls made of chiluca stone and tezontle. Chiluca, a white stone, covers the walls and floors and the tezontle frames <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows. At the crossing of the structure is an octagonal dome framed by arches that form curved triangles where they meet {{at the top of}} the dome. The principal altar is in the ornate Churrigueresque style and crafted by indigenous artist Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque. It was inaugurated in 1829.|$|E
5|$|The {{main house}} {{protected}} John McQueen's family and neighbors during attacks from invading Creeks in 1802; {{he wrote that}} at one time 26 people took refuge there. Following raids from Americans during the Patriot Rebellion in 1813, the house was gutted and vandalized. Plantations as far south as New Smyrna were destroyed by rebels fleeing into Georgia. When Kingsley arrived, there were no metal fixtures in <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> the wooden slave quarters had been burned down. John Rollins added sections to the east and west sides of the house in between the pavilions in the 1890s and removed at least three of the fireplace chimneys from the pavilions. One of the clubs that owned the island in the 1920s added electricity.|$|E
60|$|He held <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open <b>and</b> {{she passed}} out, {{with a single}} upward and {{wondering}} glance. Wingrave closed <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> seated himself close to where Barrington was standing.|$|R
6000|$|In {{another ten}} minutes the gig was at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> Father Eustace went out, {{and in another}} minute was gone. Sophy stood at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> watched them drive down into the village. Then she went in <b>and</b> shut <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> So far her plans had succeeded--would they to the end? ...|$|R
60|$|Making {{sure that}} the coast was clear this time, Hal {{unlocked}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> let himself out. Then he locked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> again, <b>and</b> threw <b>the</b> key under the table.|$|R
5|$|Travelling to {{the airport}} for her flight home, Diane and Ric come across a woman in labour, Joanna (Akofa Edjeani Asiedu), who is also {{suffering}} from malaria and having trouble breathing. It is unlikely she will survive a natural childbirth, and the nearest hospital is two hours away. They travel back to Kumi's clinic, collecting an inebriated Abra along the way. After Abra threatens to force entry, Kumi unchains <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> they manage to deliver the baby and save Joanna.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses some aspect of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus {{to the other side of}} the Doors of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches <b>the</b> <b>Doors</b> <b>and</b> fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the Doors in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the Doors while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> flashlight, {{albeit with}} slightly altered usage. The doors {{can only be}} closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E

50|$|Custom weatherstripping, {{compared}} to pre-weatherstripped units, requires {{much more time}} and {{is considered to be}} a specialized skill. Weatherstrippers install a threshold, cut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> install a sweep or J-hook to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> nail spring-steel bronze into the doorjamb to seal the gap.|$|R
5|$|Green Day {{began the}} {{recording}} process for 21st Century Breakdown in January 2008. Later that year, it was {{confirmed that the}} band worked with producer Butch Vig. The album was recorded with Vig throughout 2008 and into early 2009 at four locations in California: Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, Studio 880 in Oakland, Jel Studios in Newport Beach, and Costa Mesa Studios in Costa Mesa. While recording in Hollywood, the band members bought cheap turntables from Amoeba Music and listened to many vinyl records for inspiration, including albums by The Beat and The Plimsouls. Armstrong cited as inspiration the music of The Kinks' Ray Davies, The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow, The Doors' <b>The</b> <b>Doors</b> <b>and</b> Strange Days, and Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell. Drummer Tré Cool noted the influence of Eddie Cochran and The Creation on Armstrong's writing.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after he sees the weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut. The congregation is forced to stay longer while Groundskeeper Willie defrosts <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> then Marge is unable to start her car because of the cold.|$|E
