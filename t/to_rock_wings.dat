50|$|On August 18, 1993, an American International Airways, Inc. Douglas DC-8-61 (N814CK), {{with three}} crew members on board struck level terrain 1,400 feet {{west of the}} {{approach}} end of the runway while landing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The right wing appeared to stall, the aircraft rolled to 90-degree angle of bank and the nose pitched down. Probable cause of the accident attributed primarily to the impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue resulting from extended flight/duty hours.|$|R
40|$|Wing rock is an oscillatory {{rolling motion}} which arises at high angles of attack in {{aircraft}} with highly-swept wings.

50|$|To {{execute a}} banked turn from flying {{straight}} and level, the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> worked moderately effectively, {{but when the}} aeroplane's lateral equilibrium had been compromised, tipping the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> {{in the opposite direction}} to the down-going wing to right itself had a tendency to yaw the aircraft in that direction. In effect, the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> did not fully assist in correcting conditions of instability since the pilot had no means with which to induce or correct a yawing motion. Another possible reason behind the <b>rocking</b> <b>wing</b> idea not progressing beyond Watson’s experiments was that it could only be applied to relatively light and small aircraft.|$|R

40|$|A {{functional}} unsteady aerodynamic {{model with}} state equation representation is proposed and investigated {{with the purpose}} of evaluating it as computationally affordable model to be used in conjunction with the equations of motion <b>to</b> simulate <b>wing</b> <b>rock.</b> This state space formulation has three internal state variables that represent parameters related to the physics of the flow. Each airplane lifting surface that the airplane is split into is associated with a set of three state space equations which represents its dynamics, and with one observer equation which outputs its lifting force coefficient. The airplane lifting force coefficient is the summation of the coefficients of each lifting surface panel. The products of the panel force coefficients and their moment arms with reference to the longitudinal axis are summed up to find the global airplane rolling moment coefficient. The proposed airplane state space representation is identified against a combination of experimental aerodynamic data available in the open literature for slender delta wings. The identifications for the proposed formulation are found to match the experimental data well. The simulations in pure roll oscillations revealed that even though it was identified against simulated data based on scarce published experimental results, the model presents the expected qualitative behavior and that the concept is proved to be useful <b>to</b> simulate <b>wing</b> <b>rock.</b> Nomenclature b = wing span cr = wing root chord Cl = roll moment coefficient f, g = generic functions Ixx = moment of inertia with respect to the longitudinal axis L = roll moment p = roll rate q = dynamic pressure S = wing planform area φ = roll angle () •, 1 τ = transient time constant () •, 2 τ = time-delay constant I...|$|R

The breakdown positions, mean surface pressures, rolling moments, normal forces, and streamwise center-of-pressure locations compare reasonably well with experiment. In some cases, the primary vortex suction peaks are significantly underpredicted due to grid coarseness.

40|$|ABSTRACT) The {{objective}} of the present research is to investigate unsteady aerodynamic models with state equation representations that are valid up to the high angle of attack regime {{with the purpose of}} evaluating them as computationally affordable models {{that can be used in}} conjunction with the equations of motion <b>to</b> simulate <b>wing</b> <b>rock.</b> The unsteady aerodynamic models with state equation representations investigated are functional approaches to modeling aerodynamic phenomena, not directly derived from the physical principles of the problem.

40|$|AbstractOver the {{configuration}} of a pointed ogive-cylindrical body with 30 ° swept wing, wind tunnel experiments are conducted <b>to</b> investigate the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> motion in pitching-up {{as well as the}} flow structure responsible for it. Results show that <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> would present as a sinusoid like motion during angle of attack 20 °∼ 85 ° in high rate pitching-up. And the evolvement of forebody vortices with angle of attack should be responsible for the sinusoid like motion. Firstly, the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> is triggered by forebody asymmetric vortices at moderate angle of attack (about 30 °). Secondly, the variation of forebody asymmetric vortices with angle of attack sustains the <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> during angle of attack 30 °∼ 60 °.

40|$|Wing rock {{phenomenon}} is manifested by a limit cycle oscillation predominantly in roll about the body axis. This self-induced rolling oscillation is highly annoying {{to the pilot}} and poses serious limitation to the combat effectiveness. The maneuvering envelope of an aircraft exhibiting this behavior is also seriously restricted because the maximum angle of attack (AOA) is often limited by the onset of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> before the occurrence of stall. This thesis deals with the control and simulation investigation of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> phenomenon by the five new control schemes for the different assumptions of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> model. First, a variable phase control scheme, {{based on the results}} of energy analysis of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> hysteresis, is developed for <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> suppression. Its main advantage is small control power need. For the tracking control of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> at a fixed AOA, fuzzy PD control is then designed; however, if <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> suffers from external disturbance, fuzzy PD control exhibits a big tracking error. To overcome this disadvantage, variable universe fuzzy PD control is proposed to achieve the precise tracking control. For the tracking control of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> with a time-varying AOA and uncertainties, the NDOFEL scheme, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) combined with a feedback-error-learning (FEL) strategy, is proposed for a class of time-varying nonlinear systems with unknown disturbances, where the nominal model of <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> control is assumed available. The proposed NDOFEL not only extends the NDO into time-varying nonlinear systems but also improves the precision of tracking control. Finally, because aircraft at a high AOA operate in nonlinear flight regimes in which the dynamics are very complex, aircraft's <b>wing</b> <b>rock</b> model is usually unavailable. A reinforcement adaptive fuzzy control scheme is presented to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of the tracking error. The proposed control schemes emphasize stability, robustness, and simplicity such that they can be applied for on-line learning and real-time control. Numerical cases in each scheme are used to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes...|$|R
