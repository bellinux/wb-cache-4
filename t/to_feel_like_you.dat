[...] Sparks were initially somewhat surprised by the invitation to write a musical for Swedish radio, and were hesitant to take on the project. However, after several months of persuasive effort from Wennersten, via e-mail and telephone, they decided to accept the challenge. [...] "We originally thought of it as a side project between albums, but once we started working on it, it took on a bigger life," [...] Sparks have said. [...] "As Americans we have almost abandoned radio drama and it was truly exhilarating for us to work in a medium where the imagination of the listener is so integral a part of the work.

When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E

Strong and Gray settled on a visual theory about [...] "an emotional and physical landscape". Their goal was to depict the physical landscape in a way that differed visually from the emotions they were trying to depict. To do this, fixed television cameras were used to photograph the geographical landscape (beaches, cliffs, the estate field behind the Latimer house, etc.) and for establishing shots of interiors. A Steadicam or hand-held camera was used when the episode needed to depict the emotional relationships between people. This allowed the cinematographer to get very close to the actors without interfering with their performances.|$|E
