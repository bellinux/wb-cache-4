5|$|This line of {{occupation}} of Britain was consolidated {{as one of}} the limites (defensible frontiers) of the empire by its construction. It is a stone fortification built across the width of what is now northern England. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 80 Roman miles (73.5 statute miles or 117 kilometres) long, its width and height dependent on the construction materials which were available nearby. East of the River Irthing <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> made from squared stone and measured 3metres (9.7ft) wide and 5–6 metres (16–20ft) high, while west of the river <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> originally made from turf and measured 6metres (20ft) wide and 3.5metres (11.5ft) high; it was subsequently rebuilt in stone. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> augmented by various ditches, berms, and forts.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, the {{pavement}} close to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> excavated {{to a depth}} of two and half metres, exposing an additional two courses of large stones.|$|E
5|$|The double album <b>The</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> written {{almost entirely}} by Waters and is largely based on his life story, and having sold over 23million RIAA {{certified}} units in the US as of 2013, {{is one of the}} top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA. Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album, and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the album's sleeve art. The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of <b>The</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.|$|E

5|$|A second {{documentary}} titled Behind <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> first {{broadcast on}} 12 November 2010, {{and looks at}} the case of another similar detainee, while probing more closely at a four-month period in Ashley Smith's detention while at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, Prairies, Saskatoon. The program also depicts the two-year conflict between The Fifth Estate and CSC to broadcast more footage of the last days of Ashley Smith.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish {{access to the}} Western Wall. However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the armistice agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
50|$|When a box {{is slowly}} expanded, the {{frequency}} of the light recoiling from thewall can be computed from the Doppler shift. If <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> not moving,the light recoils at the same frequency.

5|$|In early 1920, {{the first}} Jewish-Arab {{dispute over the}} Wall {{occurred}} when the Muslim authorities were carrying out minor repair works to the Wall’s upper courses. The Jews, while agreeing that the works were necessary, appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities, because <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> an ancient relic.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|The first fortifications in Malta {{were built}} during the Bronze Age. At least six sites have been {{identified}} as possible fortified settlements. The best preserved of these is the village of Borġ in-Nadur, close to the modern town of Birżebbuġa. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar access to their village. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built facing inland, showing that the people living in the village were more afraid of attacks from the land than from the sea.|$|E

The differences between the brick strength and <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> strength <b>were</b> less than 20 %. A finite element analysis (FEA) was performed and the uniformity of the compressive stress distributions in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>was</b> evaluated. Finally, it was observed that the partial replacement of the cement by crushed ceramic waste is possible...|$|R
5|$|The {{record was}} a {{departure}} from Jackson's previous work for Motown Records. Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism, liberation, loneliness, hedonism and romance. Several critics observed that Off <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> crafted from funk, disco, soft rock, jazz, Broadway and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained critical acclaim and recognition, and won the singer his first Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|The town {{wall was}} kept in good repair whilst there was a threat of {{invasion}} from the Scots. In 1342, David II of Scotland invaded Northumberland and laid siege to Newcastle, without success. In 1388, another Scottish army under the Earl of Douglas assaulted the town, but was repulsed. As the border wars between England and Scotland became less frequent, and in particular following the union of the two crowns in 1603, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> allowed to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|Against this fraught background, Philip {{started the}} siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC. Perinthos {{occupied}} a strong position on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip {{did not have a}} large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city. Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 cubits high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and in a short time, a section of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> breached. However, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his satraps on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the Byzantians sent a body of soldiers and their best generals.|$|E

50|$|The Temple protestant de Reims was {{designed}} by Charles Letrosne in a flamboyant neo-Gothic style. Originally <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> lavishly decorated in Art Deco style by Gustave Louis Jaulmes, but in 1973 <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> painted white, giving an austere appearance.|$|R
5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle {{beyond the bounds of}} the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked a large part of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>was</b> left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E
5|$|ESPN's Chantel Jennings tweeted {{a picture}} of a Flag of Canada redone in Michigan's team colors of maize and blue at Crisler Arena on December 4. One of her {{followers}} noted that the big version on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> a general Stauskas fan flag and that a little version of the flag was added next to it for each three-pointer Canadian Stauskas made in the game. By mid-December of his freshman season, the students in the Maize Rage (Michigan student section at Crisler Arena) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag. The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas. The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January.|$|E

5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} from the walls, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> frequently mentioned in Nazi propaganda, where its size and strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all of the nations where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E
5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest {{date back to the}} days when <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>was</b> still standing. They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of the building of the Wall, for every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross {{at the scene of the}} event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated on the east side of the Reichstag building.|$|E
50|$|The area {{within the}} now ruined ramparts is 1560 m2. Most of the {{buildings}} are ruined. The only partially standing building is a three-story donjon. The length of <b>the</b> eastern <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 9.60 m and its height is 12 m. <b>The</b> northern <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 11.5 m long and 13 m high. The width of <b>the</b> outer <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> 1.50 m. <b>The</b> masonry of <b>the</b> inner <b>walls</b> <b>is</b> of ashlar blocks and <b>the</b> outer <b>walls</b> <b>is</b> of bossage blocks.|$|R
