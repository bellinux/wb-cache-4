25|$|On August 24, 2014, US {{fast food}} chain Burger King {{announced}} that it was in negotiations to merge with Tim Hortons Inc; the proposed $18 billion merger would involve a <b>tax</b> <b>inversion</b> into Canada, with a new holding company majority-owned by 3G Capital, and the remaining shares in the company held by current Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders.

500|$|Although [...] "tax inversions" [...] (in which {{a company}} {{decreases}} {{the amount of}} taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains {{the majority of their}} operations in their previous location) have been a recent financial trend, it will not have as much of an impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada: the corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%, but Burger King had used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of <b>tax</b> <b>inversion,</b> news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>inversions</b> are {{a form of}} tax avoidance, whereby {{corporations}} and individuals arrange their affairs to legally reduce their tax obligations. Unlike the law of most other developed nations, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code imposes income tax on the profits of American corporations' foreign subsidiaries. [...] This creates a strong incentive for American companies with large overseas markets to seek to recharacterize themselves as a foreign corporation.|$|R
50|$|Ireland is a {{centre of}} {{corporate}} <b>tax</b> <b>inversions,</b> a common strategy {{in which a}} United States-based company takes over a foreign company and shifts its headquarters overseas to a country, such as Ireland, with low corporate tax rates. Such corporate inversions were performed by medical device manufacturer Medtronic (which bought Covidien and reincorporated in Ireland) and Johnson Controls (which merged with Tyco International and moved to Cork, Ireland).|$|R
50|$|This {{strategy}} has helped Ireland bolster its GDP growth, but is politically controversial in the U.S. because it lowers U.S. tax revenue. In April 2016, the U.S. government announced new rules {{in a bid}} to reduce the economic incentives to perform corporate <b>tax</b> <b>inversions.</b> The changes in U.S. policy caused a planned merger between the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer and the Irish pharmaceutical company Allergan to be dropped.|$|R

Richard Phillips, senior policy analyst at Citizens for Tax Justice, praised Clinton for her support for limiting inversions (which he described as [...] "a loophole through which U.S. companies pretend to be foreign in order to avoid taxes"), but criticized her proposal to use the new revenue to reduce corporate taxes, arguing that the revenue should go toward public investments or deficit reduction instead.|$|R
40|$|The current United States <b>tax</b> code {{regarding}} <b>inversions</b> {{and collection}} of foreign taxable income is outdated in a heavily globalized world market. Multinational corporations have played games {{to circumvent the}} current <b>inversion</b> <b>tax</b> code, Section 7874, in order to lower their effective tax bill. The avoidance of taxes stems from the high corporate tax rate combined with the United States’ worldwide taxation policy, which few countries {{in the developed world}} implement. The fear for United States politicians and citizens alike is that the current trend of <b>tax</b> <b>inversions</b> will increase to the point of an exodus of corporations to tax havens. This paper will begin by analyzing inversions, from both a corporate view and a government view. It will delve into why inversions have become so prevalent today. This paper will offer a proposal to prevent unfair inversion practices by U. S. corporations and make suggestions to remove the root of the problem: a high corporate tax rate. Ultimately, this paper will conclude that an adaption of the current inversion prevention provision combined with lower taxes will not only benefit the U. S. corporations, it will maintain the current government tax revenue received from corporations, and increase cash flow into the United States...|$|R
40|$|The tax-driven {{expatriation}} of US corporations is {{a troubling}} phenomenon. In a "corporate inversion," a new foreign corporation, typically {{located in a}} low-tax or no-tax country, replaces the existing US parent corporation of a multinational enterprise (MNE). The US corporation then becomes {{a subsidiary of the}} new foreign parent. Since the US tax treatment of an MNE operating in the United States is sig-nificantly less favorable when the top-tier parent corporation is a domestic rather than a foreign corporation, the inversion transaction averts a substantial amount of US <b>tax.</b> <b>Inversions</b> have attracted adverse attention from tax specialists, media, the US Treasury Department, and Congress.

5000|$|Earnings {{stripping}} is {{a commonly}} used technique in United States domestic tax avoidance {{in which a}} U.S. corporation uses loans between different divisions of the same company to shift profits out of high-tax jurisdictions and into lower-tax ones. According to the New York Times, a multinational could reduce its [...] "American tax bill by having its American subsidiary borrow money from a foreign parent company and then deduct the interest on that loan against its earnings." [...] Earnings stripping {{is one of the}} most common tax avoidance techniques facilitated by <b>tax</b> <b>inversions.</b> In addition to allowing U.S. companies to avoid tax on non-U.S. profits, inversion also allows them to avoid taxes on some domestic profits because it facilitates several techniques for re-allocating U.S. profits to lower-tax foreign jurisdictions. One study of four inverted companies in 2004 found that most tax saving was generated by earnings stripping, not by avoiding tax on genuinely foreign profits.|$|R
40|$|The recent wave of {{corporate}} <b>tax</b> <b>inversions</b> has triggered {{interest in what}} motivates these tax-driven transactions now. Corporate executives have argued that inversions are explained by an “anti-competitive” U. S. tax environment, {{as evidenced by the}} federal corporate tax statutory rate, which is high by international standards, and by its “worldwide” tax base. This paper explains why this competitiveness narrative is largely fact-free, in part by using one recent articulation of that narrative (by Emerson Electric Co. ’s former vice-chairman) as a case study. The recent surge in interest in inversion transactions is explained primarily by U. S. based multinational firms’ increasingly desperate efforts to find a use for their stockpiles of offshore cash (now totaling around $ 1 trillion), and by a desire to “strip” income from the U. S. domestic tax base through intragroup interest payments to a new parent company located in a lower-taxed foreign jurisdiction. These motives play out against a backdrop {{of corporate}} existential despair over the political prospects for tax reform, or for a second “repatriation tax holiday” of the sort offered by Congress in 2004...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, several {{high-profile}} U. S. -based multinational corporations have changed their tax residence from the United States to Bermuda or some other tax haven. They have accomplished these expatriations, and the resulting {{millions of dollars of}} annual tax savings, merely by changing the place of incorporation of their corporate parent, without the need to make any substantive changes to their business operations or their U. S. -based management structure. Congress and the media have focused significant attention on this phenomenon. Despite this attention, Congress initially enacted only a non-tax provision targeting corporate expatriations - a purported ban on expatriated companies entering into contracts with the Department of Homeland Security. This Article addresses this alternative sanction, concluding that it is prototypical symbolic legislation, with no instrumental effect. The Article also discusses {{the extent to which the}} initial Congressional debate over expatriations may have had indirect instrumental effects by furthering the informal enforcement of social norms. Ultimately, after almost three years of debate, Congress enacted a tax provision intended to deny the desired tax benefits to expatriating corporations. The Article also addresses the substantive tax policy implications of this response, concluding that it illustrates the tenuous normative underpinnings of the place-of-incorporation rule for determining corporate residence and the need for Congress to reconsider what makes a corporation American in an increasingly globalized world. <b>Tax,</b> international <b>tax,</b> <b>inversions,</b> expatriation, symbolic legislation, social norms, multinational corporation...|$|R
2500|$|On November 23, 2015, Pfizer and Allergan, Plc {{announced}} {{their intention to}} merge for an approximate sum of $160billion, making it the largest pharmaceutical deal ever, and the third largest corporate merger in history. As part of the deal, the Pfizer CEO, Ian Read, was to remain as CEO {{and chairman of the}} new company, to be called [...] "Pfizer plc", with Allergan's CEO, Brent Saunders, becoming president and chief operating officer. As part of the deal, Allergan shareholders would receive 11.3 shares of the company, with Pfizer shareholders receiving one. The terms proposed that the merged company would maintain Allergan's Irish domicile, resulting in the new company being subject to corporation tax at the Irish rate of 12.5%--considerably lower than the 35% rate that Pfizer paid at the time. The deal was to constitute a reverse merger, whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to [...] "Pfizer, plc". The deal was expected to be completed {{in the second half of}} 2016, subject to certain conditions: US and EU approval, approval from both sets of shareholders, and the completion of Allergan's divestiture of its generics division to Teva Pharmaceuticals (expected in the first quarter of 2016). On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan announced they would be calling off the merger after the Obama administration introduced new laws intended to limit corporate <b>tax</b> <b>inversions</b> (the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).|$|R

The company completed the complex <b>tax</b> <b>inversion</b> in February 2015. The inversion - which formally resulted {{in the creation of a}} new company, Mylan N.V., with 78% of its shares held by former Myland Inc. shareholders and 22% of its shared held by Abbott Labs shareholders - was expected to immediately drop Mylan's U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% (from 24%) in the first year [...] "and into the high teens over the next three to five years." [...] The New York Times said there was something [...] "disconcerting" [...] about a company that benefits from large government contracts renouncing their citizenship for tax benefits.

500|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century the company {{returned}} to independence when it was purchased from Diageo {{by a group of}} investment firms led by TPG Capital for [...] in 2002. The new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, culminating with the company being taken public in 2006 with a highly successful initial public offering. The firms' strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns, a revamped menu strategy, a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores, and a new restaurant concept called the BK Whopper Bar. These changes re-energized the company. Despite the successes of the new owners, the effects of the financial crisis of 2007–2010 weakened the company's financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor McDonald's grew. The falling value of Burger King eventually lead to TPG and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a [...] sale to 3G Capital of Brazil. Analysts from financial firms UBS and Stifel Nicolaus agreed that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. After the deal was completed, the company's stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange, ending a four-year period as a public company. The delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's without having to worry about pleasing shareholders. 3G later took the company public again after a series of changes to its operations and structure. Burger King would eventually be merged with Canadian-based donut and coffee chain Tim Hortons, igniting a political controversy in the United States over <b>tax</b> <b>inversions.</b>|$|R
40|$|The English East India Company {{was first}} {{chartered}} in 1600, endured {{until the late}} nineteenth century, and, in a clever act of corporate resurrection, has even recently returned as a global, upmarket retail outlet selling fine foods and commemorative coins. It has also endured in the popular imagination and culture, churning out heroes and villains alike in film, television, and video games. The script writer for a forthcoming BBC miniseries, in which the East India Company stars as the prime antagonist, even noted recently that the Company was like “the CIA, the NSA, and the biggest, baddest multinational corporation on earth” wrapped into one corporation. All of this attention of late {{to one of the}} largest and most enduring corporations of its time, which managed a commercial and political system separated by half a world at upwards of a year and half’s distance, is perhaps unsurprising given the great legal, political, and economic conundrums surrounding the modern multinational corporation, from questions about global management to controversial issues such as <b>tax</b> <b>inversions,</b> monopoly, state-owned corporations, as well as the corporate person’s rights to free speech, religion, and so on. However, from outlandish film productions to the most sober of scholarship, the connections between the Company’s past and our present seem to have become all things to all people, stretched almost to the point of breaking. Though it would be impossible to be exhaustive, this Article nonetheless seeks to outline the various ways in which the East India Company’s legacy has been drawn upon in a range of fields, but especially legal and business scholarship, for a wide range of purposes. In so doing, it proposes that the sheer diversity of uses to which the Company’s history has been put, as well as the lack of any agreement about the meaning and nature of such comparisons, might suggest that the lessons the East India Company can offer to the financial, commercial, and organizational history of the modern corporation, while inherently interesting and heuristically instructive, must necessarily be limited, cautionary, and entertained at one’s own risk...|$|R
50|$|Expecting the {{likelihood}} of the proposals passing through Congress to be low, the Obama administration acted administratively to discourage inversions.

The September 22, 2014, Notice describes future regulations that can be separated into two categories: (i) special rules regarding ownership threshold requirements (ii) rules targeting certain tax planning after an inversion, primarily to access foreign earnings of the U.S. acquired corporation.|$|R
