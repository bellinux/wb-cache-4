The growing importance of maintenance sector not only in Malaysia but also increasingly globalized, the difficulty in selecting an appropriate procurement method and lack of research in this area provide an impetus for this research. There were 19 procurement selection criteria identified. In addition, there were 4 types of procurements methods which include outsourcing by specialist term contract, outsourcing by <b>tendered</b> <b>schedule</b> term contract, outsourcing by repair and maintenance contract and outsourcing by measured term contract identified to be the most popular procurement methods adapted by public universities currently and at the same time were considered most important. The decision making framework was developed based on AHP technique and principles. Expert Choice Software was employed as development tool where the criteria and alternatives were integrated into the framework. Finally, structured interview was conducted to validate the framework developed. The validation process was carried out through structured interview with selected public university...|$|R

As of that date, all public domestic companies were required to submit their filings via EDGAR, except for hardcopy paper filings, which were allowed under a hardship exemption. Third-party filings with respect to these companies, such as <b>tender</b> offers and <b>Schedule</b> 13D filings, are also filed via EDGAR.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the selection of procurement method for building maintenance management for public universities in Malaysia through the use of Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) particularly the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A large number of different types of procurement methods have been developed to overcome the weaknesses of the existing procurement method and to meet the range of service requirement. Thus, it is more challenging for the decision maker to select the most appropriate procurement method for a specific building as different types of procurement method suit different types of project. It is indeed very vital to develop a systematic approach that can assist the maintenance personnel in decision making on selecting procurement method for a particular building. The study adopted mixed method that is the combination of both qualitative and quantitative method. There were 26 procurement selection criteria identified from literature review that were divided into three main categories that were clients’ requirement, project characteristic and external environment or factor. In addition, there were 13 types of procurements methods identified in literature review. A questionnaire survey was conducted among all public universities in Malaysia with 85 per cent response rate. The finding of this research proves that the selection of procurement methods by university organizations is neither strategic nor systematic as there is no guidance available for the decision maker to rely on in order to select the most appropriate procurement strategy thus provides impetus for this study. Through the questionnaire survey, there were 19 procurement selection criteria which were categorized into 3 main criteria were shortlisted and 4 procurements methods which include outsourcing by specialist term contract, outsourcing by <b>tendered</b> <b>schedule</b> term contract, outsourcing by repair and maintenance contract and outsourcing by measured iv term contract were identified to be the most popular procurement methods adapted by public universities currently (Percent of Cases > 50...|$|R

40|$|Oil well {{drilling}} operation {{is the subject}} of many activities, and for each part of its works and activities there is a particular <b>tender</b> for time <b>schedule,</b> quality and cost. I want to go back over an event which began in 2009 and finished 15 months later after continuous operation; the Bazian exploration oil well, Bn- 1. As far as I am concerned, the most important point that I want to convey is the relation between the three main points above, giving attention to these aspects and asking some questions in this regard, which will be easy for me to answer because I was working there and I was a part of those operations. New technology, a professional team, logistic support, security, skilled staff and team work were all main elements hidden within the above-mentioned main activities. The aforementioned uses only a normal running of casing pipes, and these operations will normally take one day, but in the Bazian Bn- 1 exploration oil well the time taken was more than one month. In this paper I want to make a very quick review of most of the operations performed for running 9 - 5 / 8 ” casing for the interval from 1195 m to 2028 m, which will clearly show that after three attempts {{we were not able to}} run the casing 100 % as planned, and I will provide a technical recommendation for future operations in a similar situation...|$|R
