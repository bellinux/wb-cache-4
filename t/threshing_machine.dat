If the verb is transitive, it can be used in its intransitive meaning in form of a present passive participle: gydomasis vanduo – healing water. Compare: geriamasis vanduo – drinking water. The difference in those cases is only semantic (water cannot be healed, thus it is accepted that gydomasis vanduo denotes water having healing properties, but not water being healed).|$|E
25|$|While {{working for}} Jefferson {{over the years}} Bacon saved {{numerous}} letters and other documents in Jefferson's own handwriting, giving him directions how to manage the farm, grounds, garden, livestock of different kinds, and all the various matters connected with daily activity at Monticello. He also wrote many memoirs regarding these things, which he also saved. Historians have use Bacon's memoirs, records and letters to discern the daily activities at Monticello, as well as Jefferson's personal life and character. They show that Jefferson began to lose interest in farming after he returned from his ambassadorship to France, and that when he retired in 1794, his agricultural pursuits almost ceased completely. During this period, Bacon's memoirs record Jefferson's attention to semi-industrial activities, like the production in his nailry, building a new <b>threshing</b> <b>machine,</b> constructing a flour mill and digging a canal at the Rivanna River.|$|E

500|$|The {{mechanisation}} and rationalisation {{of agriculture}} was another important factor. Robert Bakewell and Thomas Coke introduced selective breeding, and initiated {{a process of}} inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid 18th century, such as the New Leicester sheep. Machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation, such as Jethro Tull's seed drill of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and Andrew Meikle's <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> of 1784. Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham iron plough in 1730 to James Small's improved [...] "Scots Plough" [...] metal in 1763. In 1789 Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies was producing 86 plough models for different soils. Powered farm machinery began with Richard Trevithick's stationary steam engine, used to drive a <b>threshing</b> <b>machine,</b> in 1812. Mechanisation spread to other farm uses through the 19th century. The first petrol-driven tractor was built in America by John Froelich in 1892.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{was raised}} on the family's farm, but did not care for farm life. [...] At an early age, he entered into his first {{business}} proposition: to husk a neighbor's corn. His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a <b>threshing</b> <b>machine.</b> As this type of equipment was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates tired {{of this type of}} work and he sold his interest in the <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses at the card table.|$|E
500|$|Holt {{adapted the}} combine {{to work on}} slopes. He added two {{separate}} wooden frames which enabled the drive wheels to be raised or lowered independently. This allowed the combine to operate on slopes as steep as 30 degrees while the <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> remained level. In 1890, Holt built his first experimental steam traction engine, nicknamed [...] "Old Betsy". Built on a [...] frame, it developed [...] from a single cylinder ( [...] , [...] ). The firebox could burn wood, coal, or oil as fuel. Carrying [...] of water, the traction engine weighed [...] and rode on huge metal wheels. Holt's tractors were popular despite their weight and awkward size because they could harvest large fields for one-sixth {{the cost of a}} horse-drawn combine. Foresters soon adapted them to haul redwood logs out of road-less forests. By 1897, the company had about 200 employees and had sold over 800 of their combined harvesters in California. Holt Manufacturing made about 130 steam-powered tractors between 1890 and 1904.|$|E

His father had introduced the first metal plough, importing it from England, but it had worn so quickly that he later helped a Mr. Marshall establish an iron foundry in Puebla. Marshall went on to make a considerable fortune out of the manufacture and repair of farm and textile equipment. Eulogio also acquired other technology such as a <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> developed in the United States. Unfortunately, the machine did not work well at the Chautla Hacienda, because the grain produced was coarser than the U.S. varieties. The <b>threshing</b> <b>machine</b> was left to rust in a shed. Eulogio offered to donate the machine to the Smithsonian Institution, but only on condition that it be exhibited with a large sign saying, [...] "This machine, awarded {{a gold medal in}} the Philadelphia exhibition, proved to be entirely useless in Mexico." [...] Eulogio also worked to establish an agricultural college on the property, and built the English-style residence house on the dam to house teachers.
