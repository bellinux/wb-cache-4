40|$|A wheat {{stubble field}} (clay-loam, light alkali; light salty and poor of organic matter) was {{established}} to carry out an experiment at Gökhöyük Agricultural Institute, Turkey. Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined spring tine cultivator-spike <b>tooth</b> <b>harrow</b> <b>for</b> consecutive secondary tilling. Reduced tillage included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill. Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The highest penetration resistance (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system. Reduced and no tillage systems could be proposed for Gökhöyük region if alternative solutions is found to prevent soil compaction and reduce mechanical impedance in root growth zone. Long-term investigations were suggested {{based on the results}} of this study in order to better understanding of the effects of the tillage systems on crop growth and yield for the region...|$|R
