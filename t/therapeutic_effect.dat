A shorter, 12-hour extended-release formulation {{is available}} under the brand Adderall XR and {{is designed to provide}} a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect</b> and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses 4hours apart. The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the immediate and extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect)</b> of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect</b> has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcupuncture is an {{important}} component part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> may be influenced by a variety of factors. Stimulation quantity is one of the factors for achieving good <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> in acupuncture practice. With the development of science and technology, besides the influence of manual manipulations, the parameters adopted for electroacupuncture have become the benchmark of stimulation quantity. This study, by referring to the related literatures, is designed to explore the influence of manual manipulations and electrical parameters on <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of acupuncture. The results from the present study show that different manual manipulations and electrical parameters may exert different <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of acupuncture, which are closely related to the characteristics of diseases. Different manual manipulations and electrical parameters should be adopted according to syndrome differentiation of TCM. This is very important in acupuncture treatment...|$|R

25|$|A {{very common}} {{iatrogenic}} effect {{is caused by}} drug interaction, i.e., when pharmacotherapists fail to check for all medications a patient is taking and prescribe new ones that interact agonistically or antagonistically (potentiate or attenuate the intended <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect).</b> Such situations can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions to drugs, even when unexpected by pharmacotherapists, are also classified as iatrogenic.|$|E

Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E

25|$|Bioequivalence {{does not}} mean generic drugs must be {{exactly the same as}} the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect</b> of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E

Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety, benzodiazepines have remained a mainstay of anxiolytic pharmacotherapy due to their robust efficacy, rapid onset of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect,</b> and generally favorable side effect profile. Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine whether or not the histopathological <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of preoperative chemotherapy could be useful for determining prognosis in women with locally ad-vanced breast cancer. The patients were 37 women with locally advanced breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy between 1977 and 1987. The histological grade of malig-nancy (HGM) and histopathological <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of chemotherapy (TEf) were examined in resected specimens. Patients with HGM 3 showed a poorer 10 -year overall survival (38 %) than those with HGM 1 or 2 (62 %). Patients showing a better histopathological response (TEf 1 b plus 2) had a poorer 10 -year overall survival (20 %) than those with a poorer response (TEf 0 plus / 1 a) (60 %). <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> were significantly related to histological grade, nuclear atypia and mitotic index (P= 0. 03, 0. 005 and 0. 002, respectively).

40|$|Conducted {{a test to}} {{determine}} if a benzodiazepine would enhance or hinder the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of exposure. The test consisted in assessing the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of alprazolam on flight phobics by means of questionnaires and ambulatory recordings. Physiological measures included heart rate, skin conductance levels and fluctuations, finger temperature and respiratory arrhythmia. The test was conducted by means of 2 flights 1 week apart, using 28 female Subjects with flying phobia, who were administered alprazolam and placebos in different sequences and combinations. A control group of 14 non-phobic Subjects was used for comparison purposes. Study results indicate that alprazolam increases physiological activation under acute stress conditions and hinders <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effects</b> of exposure in flight phobics.

In fact, intrinsic and sometimes adverse effects of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy — necessarily aggressive for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect</b> — frequently produce such iatrogenic effects as hair loss, hemolytic anemia, diabetes insipidus, vomiting, nausea, brain damage, lymphedema, infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is iatrogenic, {{as in the case}} of diabetes consequential to the removal of all or part of the pancreas.|$|E

25|$|Diarrhea {{can cause}} {{electrolyte}} imbalances, renal impairment, dehydration, and defective immune system responses. When oral drugs are administered, {{the efficiency of}} the drug is to produce a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>effect</b> and the lack of this effect {{may be due to the}} medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can have a profound effect on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults in long term care facilities (nursing homes).|$|E
