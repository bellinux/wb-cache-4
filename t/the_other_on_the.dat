5|$|Alan Tudyk had {{the idea}} for an episode about a planet that is always day on one side, and night on <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of {{pheromone}} on himself and the crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased {{back to the ship}} by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.|$|E
5|$|Because they {{deferred}} their {{selection to}} the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half. The Hokies continued to rotate between quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor during the possession, and picked up two first downs, one {{through the air and}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E

5|$|On the field, the Australians {{continued}} to flourish. The Third Test was a rain-affected draw, {{and between the}} First and Fourth Tests, they won four of their five county matches, drawing <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{final day of the}} Fourth Test, Australia's batsmen set a world Test cricket record by scoring 404 to win the match, thereby taking a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Orange-spotted Emerald – {{only ever}} known from two areas in {{southern}} England, one around the River Stour and Moors River in east Dorset, where the species was recorded from 1820 to 1963, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River Tamar in Devon where the species {{was recorded in}} 1946 only.|$|E

5|$|The {{video game}} {{adaptation}} {{was part of}} a resurgence of popularity in Japanese horror sparked by the original book, and was released alongside a film adaptation and two manga comics; one based on the book, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> video game. The original title was also followed by two video game sequels: Parasite Eve II in 1999 and The 3rd Birthday in 2010, and was re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Muxloe Castle is {{positioned}} {{set back from}} the village of Kirby Muxloe on low-lying land; the castle's gardens and orchard probably stood to the north and west of the current site. John Goodall suggests that the earlier residence on the site was built around two courts, one of which survives within the later castle, with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north-west side of the site. The historian Anthony Emery, however, argues that the earlier manor was similar in size and shape to the current castle: he suggests that it was fortified and was protected by a moat similar to that seen today. The foundations of the first residence discovered between 1912 and 1913 were left uncovered after the excavations and remain visible in the castle lawns.|$|E
5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} {{the aftermath of the}} shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E

5|$|The Prussian army {{marched in}} two columns toward Kay, {{one on the}} road {{directly}} to Kay, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to Mosau. Barely had they emerged from the ravines surrounding the town when they fell into combat with some Russian skirmishers. The Prussians repulsed the initial group, but the arrival of reinforcement meant the onset of generalized action. The Russians subsequently fired on the Prussians from the heights surrounding Kay. General Heinrich von Manteuffel took six battalions and attacked on the artillery; initially they threw him back. A contemporary participant maintained that Manteuffel succeeded in over-running the positions and took 40 pieces of cannon, {{but there is no}} official evidence to support his statement. There were three assaults at Kay in that afternoon, and each was thrown back.|$|E
5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part}} of the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E

50|$|Green Street is a road {{discontinuous}} from <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{western side}} of the reservation in Milton and Canton. It runs from Royall Street in Canton northeast to a junction with Washington Street in Milton, skirting the westernmost edge of the reservation. This section of the reservation was acquired in the 1940s; the road was originally a municipal street.|$|R

These newer counties (one name earlier lost to Kentucky, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following list) are respectively, Madison and Rappahannock. Both the newer counties of that name are located in Virginia's Piedmont region.|$|E
25|$|In later years, a {{more subtle}} method of disrupting Christian {{holidays}} involved broadcasting very popular movies one after <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major holidays when believers are expected to participate in religious processions, especially during the Easter celebration. Apparently, this was intended to keep those whose faith was uncertain or wavering {{in their homes and}} glued to their TVs.|$|E
50|$|Alice and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Umbrella Corporation {{freighter}} Arcadia, now {{faced an}} attack by an assaulting fleet of tiltrotor V-22 Ospreys led by Alice's former ally, Jill Valentine, resulting {{in the killing of}} many of the survivors in the ship.

A petrosomatoglyph or stone footprint at North Yell, up Hena, is {{known locally as}} the 'Wartie' and was used to wash in dew or rain-water and standing in {{it was supposed to}} get rid of warts.

25|$|Both armies {{faced each}} other for days, yet none dared to attack <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> 26 May 1249, Enzio ordered his troops to assume a formation, he split his army into 3 corps and {{positioned}} them into 2 lines. Ugoni divided his forces into 4 corps on a broad line. Once, the 2,000 additional troops from Bologna had arrived, Ugoni charged for battle.|$|E
25|$|Two inquests {{were held}} into the events, {{one on the}} Gateshead side and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Newcastle side.

Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister appointed one Captain Ducane of the Royal Engineers to attend on the government's behalf, and dispatched Alfred Swaine Taylor FRS to investigate the chemical causes of the explosion.|$|E

50|$|Each {{class has}} its own {{distinctive}} ribbon, the first three classes being worn around <b>the</b> neck, and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest. In the military division, the SSA ribbon is plain dark blue and the SSAS ribbon is dark blue with a white band down the centre.

50|$|Each segment {{has four}} bundles of chaetae, with two <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underside, and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides. The bundles can contain one to 25 chaetae, and include muscles {{to pull them}} {{in and out of}} the body. This enables the worm to gain a grip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soil or mud as it burrows into the substrate. When burrowing, the body moves peristaltically, {{alternately}} contracting and stretching to push itself forward.|$|R
