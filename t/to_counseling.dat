500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} {{with what was}} on the screen, later recalling, [...] "It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door <b>to</b> <b>counseling</b> from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E

2500|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{includes several}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>counseling</b> and therapy. Among the earliest approaches {{we find the}} developmental theory of Abraham Maslow, emphazising a hierarchy of needs and motivations; the existential psychology of Rollo May acknowledging human choice and the tragic aspects of human existence; and the person-centered or client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers, which is centered on the client's capacity for self-direction and understanding {{of his or her}} own development. Client-centered therapy is non-directive; the therapist listens to the client without judgement, allowing the client to come to insights by themselves. [...] The therapist should ensure that all of the client’s feelings are being considered and that the therapist has a firm grasp on the concerns of the client while ensuring that there is an air of acceptance and warmth. [...] Client-centered therapist engages in active listening during therapy sessions.|$|E

More recent clinical techniques used in the United States have been limited <b>to</b> <b>counseling,</b> visualization, social skills training, psychoanalytic therapy, and spiritual interventions such as [...] "prayer and group support and pressure", though there are some reports of aversive treatments through unlicensed practice {{as late as the}} 1990s.

2500|$|Over {{a period}} of decades, Bartlett has weighed the {{question}} whether psychotherapy is truly effective. In 1987, his book When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide <b>to</b> <b>Counseling</b> and Therapy was published and subsequently adopted by the Psychology Today Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club. The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals. The book {{was followed by the}} publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy, about which psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: [...] "It is one of the best, if not the best, that I have read on this subject." [...] Similarly, psychologist Hans H. Strupp, who has extensively studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy, commented: [...] "I find myself in substantial agreement with [...] major points which are well stated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{originally}} developed his theory {{to be the}} foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called this [...] "non-directive therapy" [...] but later replaced the term [...] "non-directive" [...] with the term [...] "client-centered" [...] and then later used the term [...] "person-centered". Even before the publication of Client-Centered Therapy in 1951, Rogers believed that the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts and not just in the therapy situation. As a result, he started to use the term person-centered approach later in his life to describe his overall theory. Person-centered therapy is the application of the person-centered approach to the therapy situation. Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, cross-cultural relations and other [...] "helping" [...] professions and situations. In 1946 Rogers co-authored [...] "Counseling with Returned Servicemen," [...] with John L. Wallen (the creator of the behavioral model known as The Interpersonal Gap), documenting the application of person-centered approach <b>to</b> <b>counseling</b> military personnel returning from the second world war.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was born}} (with his twin sister Cassandra) in San Diego, California, to 19-year-old Sandy Williams and her husband, 18-year-old Errick Williams. He was born inside of Jack Murphy Stadium, also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Murph" [...] by San Diegans. Growing up middle class, his parents divorced in 1983 and Williams, at the age of five, was taking care of his sisters by putting them to bed and even cooking for them. Perhaps due to his broken home and the fact that his father was gone at such an early age, Williams suffered from anger issues that eventually led his mother to send him <b>to</b> <b>counseling.</b> He also struggled academically, despite a test he took as a six-year-old which revealed that he had the intelligence of someone twice his age. Williams himself once said, [...] "I was always very bright, but not necessarily a hard worker. I think I was in eighth grade when I became really focused as a student and started getting good grades." [...] By high school Williams was an honor roll student and was named to the San Diego Union-Tribune All-Academic team.|$|E
