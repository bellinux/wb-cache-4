5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from <b>the</b> <b>Census</b> <b>Bureau,</b> which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward.

5|$|The FIPS {{county code}} is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely {{identifies}} counties and county equivalents in the United States. The three-digit number {{is unique to}} each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Addison County, Vermont is 001, Belknap County, New Hampshire and Alachua County, Florida are also 001. To uniquely identify Addison County, Vermont, one must use the state code of 50 plus the county code of 001; therefore, the unique nationwide identifier for Addison County, Vermont is 50001.
