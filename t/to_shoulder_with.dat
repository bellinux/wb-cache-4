500|$|Marc Buxton of Den of Geek {{gave the}} episode four stars out of five, praising the {{reveal that the}} [...] "dull threat" [...] of Lucy Bauer was just masking the true villain, Morrow.

It’s a tour of many different pieces of the Marvel Universe"; and the connections to Agent Carter, which he said were [...] "cool to see [...] make her defunct series {{more important to the}} tapestry of the MCU." [...] Evan Valentine at Collider scored the episode four stars out of five, indicating a [...] "very good" [...] episode that [...] "has left me more excited for the future of this season than the show ever has. “The Good Samaritan” managed to blend in nearly all the crazy aspects of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and produce a quality episode that stands shoulder <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> their best."

But Khrushchev is trying in vain... Under the leadership of the PLA, the Albanian people have scored historic victories in the course of these twenty years: they liberated the country from the fascist invaders and established the people's state power, reconstructed the war-ravaged country, liquidated the centuries-old backwardness and achieved great successes in the construction of socialist society... Our Party is fighting for a great cause, for the truth of Marxism-Leninism... On this course, marching shoulder <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> the sister Marxist-Leninist parties and the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries, as well as with all the revolutionary forces of the world, our Party and people will score complete victory over the imperialist and revisionist enemies. Marxism-Leninism cannot be vanquished! Socialism and communism will triumph!" ...|$|E

On 2 December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the ongoing flood situation with Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. In the Lok Sabha, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said that Singh would chair a high-level meeting to deliver relief to the people of Tamil Nadu.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether differences in variability at address exist between golfers of low and high handicaps. A consistent shot type was employed by 20 golfers from 2 skill groups over 10 – 15 shots with a midiron. Kinematics analysis revealed only one significant difference between skill levels: the alignment relationship between the stance and <b>shoulders,</b> <b>with</b> the high skill golfers demonstrating reduced variability. Whole group variability was significantly reduced between {{the distance of the}} ball and the midpoint of the stance, pelvis and shoulders. Alignment variability also significantly decreased toward distal segments of the kinematic sequence where variable error decreased between the alignment of stance relative <b>to</b> <b>shoulders</b> and pelvis relative <b>to</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>with</b> no effect of skill level. Results suggest the more distal segments of the kinematic sequence present a greater need for reduced detrimental variability. Coaches should ensure that golfers understand the importance of shoulder alignment in relation to the stance and how on course slopes and lies can influence the positions presented at address for distal segments of the golf swing kinematic sequence...|$|R

2500|$|The gun emplacements were {{finished}} on 28 April. Eleven batteries {{with a total}} of 48 guns (varying from 3-pdrs to 24-pdrs) and 18 siege mortars (varying from 30 to 60 pounds caliber) were in place. These guns would fire about 14,000 projectiles during the three days of the bombardment, that started on 28 April. The devastation of the fortress and town was immense. Hardly a house remained undamaged. The front of the attack was leveled. Around 2,000 people (both soldiers and civilians) were killed (one mortar bomb killed a woman and her eight children at one stroke). But the civilians took part in the defense, organised as artilleurs-bourgeois (burgher artillerists) and stood shoulder <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> the battalions of the Meuse and [...] Moselle that formed the garrison. Their wives nursed the wounded and succoured the dying. The city would later collectively receive the Légion d'Honneur for its bravery.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{few years}} in the early eighteenth century Wesley {{found himself in the}} vortex of controversy. Brought up in the dissenting tradition, he had swerved into {{conformity}} {{at some point during the}} 1680s, possibly under the influence of Tillotson, whom he greatly admired (of. Epistle to a Friend, pp.5–6). In 1702 there appeared his Letter from a Country Divine to his friend in London concerning the education of dissenters in their private academies, apparently written about 1693. This attack upon dissenting academies was published at an unfortunate time, when the public mind was inflamed by the intolerance of overzealous churchmen. Wesley was furiously answered; he replied in A Defence of a Letter (1704), and again in A Reply to Mr. Palmer's Vindication (1707). It is scarcely to Wesley's credit that in this quarrel he stood shoulder <b>to</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>with</b> that most hot-headed of all contemporary bigots, Henry Sacheverell. His prominence in the controversy earned him the ironic compliments of Daniel Defoe, who recalled that our [...] "Mighty Champion of this very High-Church Cause" [...] had once written a poem to satirize frenzied Tories (Review, II, no. 87, 22 September 1705). [...] About a week later Defoe, having got wind of a [...] collection being taken up, for Wesley—who in consequence of a series of misfortunes was badly in debt—intimated that High-Church pamphleteering had turned out very profitably for both Lesley and Wesley (2 October 1705). But in such snarling and bickering Wesley was out of his element, and, he seems to have avoided future quarrels.|$|E
