5|$|Coonhounds existed as a {{distinct}} type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to World War I raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from destroying crops.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} days of the war, Göring was {{repeatedly}} ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from falling into enemy hands.|$|E
5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 18/19 October, the Japanese cut the route that the Australians were using to supply the 2/17th {{defending}} Jivevaneng and established a road block astride the Jivevaneng–Sattelberg road. The 2/17th {{and a number of}} other Australian units, such as most of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, as well as part of the 2/28th, became isolated behind Japanese lines. In order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> supplied, emergency air drops of ammunition were flown in by pilots of No. 4 Squadron RAAF.|$|E

5|$|In August, Schuyler left to {{meet with}} representatives of the Iroquois Confederacy in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> neutral during the invasion, leaving Montgomery in command of the forces at Fort Ticonderoga. While Schuyler was away, Montgomery {{received}} intelligence that the British were building two gunboats on Lake Champlain, which, when complete, would give the British military access to the lake. Without asking permission from Schuyler, he moved 1,200 men north on the schooner Liberty and the sloop Enterprise. Montgomery wrote a letter to Schuyler, explaining the situation.|$|E

5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of beetle, perhaps for {{protection}} against adverse conditions and predators. The rove beetle Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the rising tide. The maternal beetle patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> well-oxygenated.|$|E
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E

5|$|The Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association added a Chautauqua Day to {{the camp}} meeting in 1885, and it became highly popular. It {{occurred}} on the first Thursday of the meeting. A number of people, including Lyman Abbot, frequented the Chautauqua Days as a speaker. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from interfering with other camp meeting activities, the day {{was moved to the}} Tuesday before the official start of the meeting in 1886, but in 1889, it was moved to the first Wednesday.|$|E
5|$|The Røros Line was {{connected}} to the station at Brattøra at 24 June 1884, allowing Marienborg to be us as a common maintenance depot for both lines. The Meråker Line's locomotives were then renumbered, starting at 51, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> distinguished from the Røros Line's. From the same year, the Meråker Line was assigned two Class 8 locomotives. From 1896, Class 15 locomotives were used, and two years later supplemented by the Class 17.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E

5|$|They {{are kind}} birds but the male Sebright may get {{protective}} around hens and may turn {{on its own}} owners like all roosters may do. And due to their light, flighty nature it might be best <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> contained to a smaller, fenced off area. Sebrights often will live happily living amongst other breeds as well. Sebrights are not prolific egglayers and hens are only expected to produce 60-80 creamy-white eggs each season.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> all straight.|$|E
5|$|After {{the breakup}} with Esperanza, Martín resumes his romance with Constanza and {{eventually}} proposes marriage to her, {{in order to}} improve his chances of winning custody of the three siblings. The judge, who thought that Esperanza was a bad influence on the children, gives the adoption to Constanza instead of Martín, forcing him to marry her. Their marriage proves difficult; Constanza is demanding and possessive, and despises the adopted siblings, who hate her as well. Martín finally breaks with Constanza when she pretends to be blind to keep him with her. The children's custody battle delays the divorce, as Martín wants <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
