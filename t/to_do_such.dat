5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} {{undercut}} their own long-term financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source of theatrical income {{was a new}} James Bond film {{every two or three}} years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong arguments for the rights <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> films.|$|E

He was the first South African <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such.</b> In addition, Drum is only the second English language film to have won the Golden Stallion at FESPACO, the first being Kwaw Ansah's Heritage Africa in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E

5|$|Only then, in April 879, did Ibn Tulun {{return to}} Egypt. Abbas fled west with his supporters, and from Barqa {{tried to take}} over Ifriqiya. Defeated by the Ifriqiyans (probably {{in the winter of}} 880–881), he retreated back east to Alexandria, where he was finally confronted and {{captured}} by Ibn Tulun's forces. After being publicly paraded seated on a mule, Ibn Tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions, who had driven him to rebel. Ibn Tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would refuse <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> a dishonourable act, but he agreed. Weeping, Ibn Tulun had Abbas whipped and imprisoned. He then named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir-apparent.|$|E
5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he {{was enrolled in a}} cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E

25|$|Plans of {{extending}} the Red Line to the Eastside {{have been set}} aside with opening of the Metro Gold Line East extension to the neighborhoods of Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles in 2009. Although {{there are no plans}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such,</b> it is conceivable that plans for a future eastward extension could involve the San Gabriel Valley rather than the Eastside. Some citizen proposals have included the conversion of the El Monte Busway to heavy rail, although this would disrupt the existing bus and Metrolink service along that corridor. Other rights-of-way that could host a Red Line extension, whether subway or at-grade, include the Union Pacific's Alhambra Trench, the former Pacific Electric two-track right of way extending through the City Terrace area to El Monte and Covina, and the median of Huntington Drive, which also held a two-track Pacific Electric line extending as far as Azusa & Glendora, until 1951, when it was removed.|$|E

The Carnegie Hall performances included the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The Tokyo concerts in December were an acclaimed success but the Hong Kong Concert on December 29 had to be canceled {{two hours before the}} show. The cancellation was due to an oversight by the promoter in applying for the entertainment license necessary to perform the show. However the date was fulfilled on the following day, December 30, by Yoshiki performing for free with ticket holders being refunded, the first time ever for a major music artist <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> a thing in Hong Kong. The concerts in Carnegie Hall on January 12 and 13 were successful sellout shows. Yoshiki also included in the show a surprise performance of The Star-Spangled Banner after a heartfelt speech about his personal pursuit of the American Dream.|$|E
25|$|The Isle of Man TT {{was part}} of the FIM Motor-Cycle Grand Prix World Championship (now MotoGP) between 1949 and 1976.

After the 1972 races, multiple world champion and dominant motorcycle racer of his time Giacomo Agostini announced he would never race again at the Isle of Man, declaring it too dangerous for international competition and that it was outrageous that such a race should never be part of a scenario where riders were forced <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> a race; at this point the Isle of Man TT was not suited to the growing professionalism and business aspects of Grand Prix motorcycle racing. More and more riders joined his boycott, and by 1976 the race was stricken from the championship and replaced by the British Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|Ross {{first went}} to Washington, D.C. in 1816 {{as part of a}} Cherokee {{delegation}} to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, {{he was elected to the}} National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of mixed blood. Even the traditionalist full-blood Cherokee perceived that he had the skills necessary to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, the first time a tribe had ever shown the audacity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>such</b> a thing. Along the way, Ross built political support in the capital for the Cherokee cause.|$|E
