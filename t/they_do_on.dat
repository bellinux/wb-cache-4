5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
25|$|Every day, {{apart from}} Sundays, {{activities}} take place after classes have finished. All pupils {{are required to}} partake in an activity but are free to choose what activities they do. At {{the beginning of the}} term pupils can decide which ones <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> what days from the available list. Some activities are only available at certain points in the year such as cricket in the summer term. During heavy exam periods activities become optional but usually only for senior years pupils.|$|E

25|$|After {{reaching}} Quorn, work moved {{ahead to}} extend the second track to Loughborough. The double track between Loughborough and Rothley opened on 1 June 2000. This gave additional capacity, which is especially useful at galas, where up to six trains may be in operation at any one time. This enables the running of non-passenger-carrying trains (freights, TPO set) during galas {{to a greater extent}} than any other heritage railway. It also means that the timetable can be generally adhered to, as delays do not cascade, as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> single track lines.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide {{from one side to the}} other. While they are primarily water creatures, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> occasion venture onto land. When they do, the plate can be covered with a metal cap for protection. In some versions of the legends, kappa spend spring and summer in the water, and the rest of the year in the mountains as Yama-no-Kami (山の神, “mountain gods”). Although they are reported to live throughout Japan, they are often said to be particular to Saga Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Price and Pavelich have {{an entirely}} {{different}} view of the Internet than other free daily publishers. While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, the creators of the Palo Alto Daily News model have refused to put their content online. They argue that posting their stories online will reduce demand for their printed newspapers, which will also reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print ads. They note that readers have dropped their subscriptions to paid newspapers because they can get the same stories online, yet those newspapers make far less money on their websites than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> their print editions.|$|E

25|$|The S79 SBS route {{began on}} September 2, 2012. While the routing was left mostly intact, the S79 had all local service {{eliminated}} {{and replaced by}} local service on the S59 route along Richmond Avenue and the S78 route along Hylan Boulevard. The route was also straightened through New Springville to bypass the Yukon Bus Depot. This route uses rigid 40-foot Orion VII hybrid-electric diesel buses, {{and is the only}} SBS line that does not utilize off-board fare collection. Additionally, it was the only SBS line in the 5 boroughs that did not use 60-foot articulated buses before the B46 SBS was introduced as well as the only SBS line to not have blue destination signs until July 2017. Riders must pay the fare on board, as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> local, limited-stop, and express buses. The S79 Select Bus Service is based out of the Yukon Bus Depot.|$|E
25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry auction market environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E

When Charles and his band counter with their original version, Garrett Morris tells them, [...] "Sorry. That'll never make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Xtort was pre-produced and tracked in Seattle at Hole in the Wall Studio, and {{recorded}} and mixed in Chicago at Chicago Recording Company. [...] Konietzko contacted F. M.

[...] Konietzko also brought {{in a number of}} Wax Trax! alumni, such as Chris Connelly of Revolting Cocks and Bill Rieflin of Ministry, to help with the album's creation, along with assistance from more than a dozen studio musicians. Konietzko required all the album's contributors to be on call thirteen hours a day during production, saying [...] "I don't care what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> their own time, but when they do KMFDM, if they don't comply with the schedule, they're out." ...|$|E
500|$|To bring {{authenticity}} to the film's {{portrayal of}} spelling bees, George Hornedo, who competed in spelling bees in real life, {{was hired to}} play contestant Roman and be [...] "an unofficial technical consultant." [...] Hornedo helped the actors to recreate [...] "certain habits and idiosyncrasies <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> stage to help them spell." [...] Thus, Akeelah skipping rope to memorize the words was added as [...] "something that was normal for the spelling bee" [...] but Atchison tried to create it in a [...] "subtle" [...] way as he thought the audience could consider this unrealistic. Hornedo and other children who had never acted before were cast because of their authentic portrayals of nervous contestants; other kids, in Atchison's eyes, were [...] "too old in how they acted". Also, Jacques Bailly, who won the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1980 and is currently the contest's official pronouncer, since 2003, played himself in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Mead {{stated that}} the Arapesh people, also in the Sepik, were pacifists, {{although}} she noted that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> occasion engage in warfare. Her observations about the sharing of garden plots among the Arapesh, the egalitarian emphasis in child rearing, and her documentation of predominantly peaceful relations among relatives {{are very different from}} the [...] "big man" [...] displays of dominance that were documented in more stratified New Guinea cultures—e.g. by Andrew Strathern. They are a different cultural pattern.|$|E
2500|$|Daily {{cleaning}} of dentures is recommended. Plaque and tartar can build up on false teeth, just as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> natural teeth. [...] Cleaning {{can be done}} using chemical or mechanical denture cleaners. Dentures should not be worn continuously, but rather {{left out of the}} mouth during sleep. This is to give the tissues a chance to recover, and wearing dentures at night is likened to sleeping in shoes. The main risk is development of fungal infection, especially denture-related stomatitis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state of}} Puebla {{is located on}} the east side of the volcanoes of Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, {{opposite}} of the Valley of Mexico and Mexico City. The two volcanoes have as much significance here as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> the west side, with many communities nearby maintaining ritual specific to honoring the two. These arose as fertility rituals but today are called “birthdays” with 12 March reserved for Popocatepetl and 30 August for Iztaccíhuatl. [...] On these events, special foods and gifts are prepared as offerings and left in certain places. These traditions have survived despite the evangelization efforts of the colonial period.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} Muslim {{countries}} try to overcome {{some of these}} difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, Malaysia, Indonesia, {{and a few others}} begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> this subject, and what they actually do.

2500|$|Since {{its initial}} appearance, many coaches have become {{reluctant}} to use the strategy amid those criticisms of it, as well as doubts about its ultimate effectiveness in minimizing scoring. One contributing factor to those doubts is that players sometimes show a penchant for making {{a greater percentage of}} his free throws when the Hack-a-Shaq strategy is being employed against them than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>on</b> the whole. [...] Some have theorized that sending O'Neal to the foul line repeatedly over a short period of time, as the Hack-a-Shaq strategy did, ran the risk of allowing him to [...] "get into a rhythm" [...] in shooting his free throws. When that happened, then the strategy would negate itself by inadvertently transforming O'Neal (temporarily) into a better free throw shooter.|$|E
