My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evidence tell me it is not.

This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law....

30|$|In {{all these}} studies, it is {{proposed}} that similarity-based fuzzy reasoning methods {{do not require}} {{the construction of a}} fuzzy relation. Accordingly, they are based on the computation of the degree of similarity between <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> antecedent of a rule in a rule-based system. Then, based on the similarity value between the membership values of the elements of the fuzzy set representation of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> corresponding fuzzy set in the antecedent of the rule, the membership value of each element of the consequent fuzzy set of the rule is modified to obtain a conclusion. This is the same for all existing similarity-based reasoning schemes. The modification procedure is different for different schemes.|$|R

In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come to, is that the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will not look at <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a black-out, with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E
500|$|Woon was {{the first}} Attorney-General in {{more than ten years}} to {{personally}} appear in court. On 28 July 2008, he argued before the Court of Appeal that a woman who had manipulated her teenage lover into killing her husband should be given a life sentence. The Court held that a life sentence was inappropriate due to the defendant's psychiatric condition, and affirmed the nine-year jail term imposed by the High Court. Woon elected to take proceedings against Tang Wee Sung, chairman of the company C.K. Tang which owns Tangs department store, for the illegal purchase of a human organ– a kidney– in the first case of its kind in Singapore. The decision to do so was criticised by Dr. Lee Wei Ling, Director of the National Neuroscience Institute and daughter of Minister Mentor and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in an article published in The Straits Times on 5 September 2008. Woon replied, pointing out a number of misconceptions she held as to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law, and emphasising that the prosecution had been brought as no one was above the law. Subsequently, in response to further comments by Dr. Lee, he wrote an extended article entitled [...] "Wrong Facts and Faulty Logic" [...] that appeared in The Straits Times on 18 September 2008.|$|E

It is precisely for this reason the group remains relevant today.
