25|$|Hitler {{never gave}} the go-ahead, for reasons still {{uncertain}} today.Some people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> neutral Switzerland {{would have been}} useful to hide Axis gold and to escape for war criminals in case of defeat. This was also the reason for maintaining Sweden's neutrality. Although the Wehrmacht feigned moves toward Switzerland in its offensives, it never attempted to invade. After D-Day, the operation was put on hold, and Switzerland remained neutral {{for the duration of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|When Louis XVI {{swore to}} observe the {{constitution}} of September 1791, the emperor professed to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> settlement had been reached in France. The attacks {{on the rights of}} the German princes on the left bank of the Rhine, and the increasing violence of the parties in Paris which were agitating to bring about war, soon showed, however, that this hope was vain. Leopold meant to meet the challenge of the revolutionists in France with dignity and temper, however the effect of the Declaration of Pillnitz was to contribute to the radicalization of their political movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{placebo effect}} {{is related to}} the {{perceptions}} and expectations of the patient; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but, if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the nocebo effect. In 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will feel different leads a person to actually feel different. According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect, and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those that <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.|$|E

25|$|Laws on {{domestic}} violence vary by country. While {{it is generally}} outlawed in the Western world, {{this is not the}} case in many developing countries. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a UNICEF survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, 80% in Central African Republic. Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries: for instance 62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica {{was first}} {{described}} by Henry Charles Andrews {{in the seventh}} volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P.wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P.wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P.corallina and P.corallina var. triternata, and P.wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P.triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P.corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P.wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow {{was the first to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P.wittmanniana to P.corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P.corallina, P.mlokosewitschii, P.macrophylla, P.wittmanniana, and introduced P.wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P.triternata and P.corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P.corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P.wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P.mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P.corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P.mlokosewitschii, P.wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P.tomentosa and the new P.abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P.mlokosewitschii - as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets - and P.triternata, P.caucasica, P.wittmanniana, P.macrophylla, P.tomentosa and P.abchasica - all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P.daurica, P.mlokosewitschii and P.wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P.kavachensis (= P.caucasica), P.mlokosewitschii (including P.tomentosa) and P.wittmanniana (including P.abchasica). P.wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P.steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P.abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P.ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.|$|E
