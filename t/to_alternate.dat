40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} derivations from logic programs, and find it {{closely related to the}} complexity of computations of alternating Turing machines. In particular, we define three complexity measures over logic programs—goal-size, length, and depth—and show that goal-size is linearly related <b>to</b> <b>alternating</b> space, the product of length and goal-size is linearly related <b>to</b> <b>alternating</b> tree-size, and the product of depth and goal-size is linearly related <b>to</b> <b>alternating</b> time. The bounds obtained are simultaneous. As an application, we obtain a syntactic characterization of Nondeterministic Linear Space and Alternating Linear Space via logic programs...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

5|$|Initial rumors {{suggested}} that Cornell {{took issue with}} having two managers {{actively involved in the}} project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> who released the band's albums.|$|E

Archer then meets with old T'Pol on board old Enterprise, and considers a plan where his ship could pass through it safely, due <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> modifications suggested by her. A frustrated Lorian then reveals a secret plan: to steal the newer plasma injectors from Enterprise to allow them to confront the Xindi in the place of their ancestors.|$|E

They continued <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> between purr and hiss and fighting one another until one triumphed. The victor flew towards the female and both chirped melodically before copulation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractState-alternating {{context-free}} grammars are introduced, and {{the language}} classes obtained from them are compared to the classes of the Chomsky hierarchy {{as well as to}} some well-known complexity classes.

5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it. One team member ran the first obstacle, then passed its flag to a partner, who then moved on to the next obstacle. The team continued <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> in this manner until they had completed the course or until time ran out. For safety reasons, team members were given helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads to wear while running the course.|$|E
5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (one of our main sources of this history).|$|E
5|$|During the 2007–08 season, he was {{replaced}} by backup Chris Osgood, who had originally been traded away from the Red Wings {{to make way for}} Hašek before the 2001-02 season. When Hašek recovered and got back into his stride, Detroit chose <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit coach Mike Babcock announced Hašek to start in the 2008 playoffs. Through the first two games against the Nashville Predators, the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism in practice and continued to support his teammates, with Darren McCarty citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually the Red Wings beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Hokies's defeat, Virginia Tech chose to start a new quarterback and a new {{offensive}} plan. Behind freshman Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies rolled to five straight victories, including a win over No.22 Clemson by 18points. During the winning streak, Sean Glennon, who had started at quarterback for the Hokies during the first two games of the season, returned <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> possessions with Taylor in an unusual two-quarterback system. On October 25, the Hokies had a chance to make up for their early-season loss to LSU when they faced No.2 Boston College on a Thursday night in Blacksburg, Virginia. Though the Hokies dominated for most of the game, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan managed a late-game comeback to win the game 1410 with 11seconds remaining.|$|E
5|$|Italia and Lepanto {{spent the}} first decade of their careers {{alternative}} between the Active and Reserve Squadrons of the Italian fleet, and were primarily occupied with training exercises. As Italy {{was a member of the}} Triple Alliance at the time, the simulated opponent in these maneuvers was typically France; during the 1893 annual fleet maneuvers, both ships served in the squadron simulating an attack on the Italian coast. In June 1897, Lepanto steamed to Britain to represent Italy at the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, held on the 26th of the month. The ships continued <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> between the squadrons, with 1897 and 1898 in the Reserve, and 1899 in the Active Squadron. During this period, the Italian Navy considered rebuilding the ships along the same lines as the ironclad , but the project proved to be too costly, and by 1902 the plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends <b>to</b> <b>alternate</b> only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E
