"Color and markings" [...] has {{the most}} points because {{emphasizing}} this encourages care and organization in breeding by ensuring that establish varieties of hamsters persist without becoming diluted in the gene pool. Hamsters in straight classes have their colors judged against established, historical models for that class. Fur can influence this class, as longer hamster hair tends to make a hamster look lighter in color. [...] "Type" [...] refers to conformation of body type to the ideal hamster. Wild hamsters have broad bodies, heads which are large {{in proportion to the}} body, a short face, and blunt nose. Indiscriminate breeding can produce hamsters which vary from the wild type, and <b>type</b> <b>judging</b> preserves what is natural or established. [...] "Fur" [...] should be dense and soft. A common shortcoming for bred hamsters is thin belly fur. Among long haired hamsters, there must be consideration that males have thicker, denser long hair than females, and each sex should be judged according to what is expected of that sex and not is typical for the other. Similarly, [...] "size" [...] judging should take into account that females are larger than males. Size judging includes making an experienced judgement of whether a hamster is thin or fat, and in either of those cases, points would be deducted. [...] "Condition" [...] is a check of health, including any dry skin, oily fur, long nails, or long teeth. [...] "Ears and eyes" [...] judging checks for round ears without nicks, ears that are held up and alert, and eyes that are bright and not runny or closed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Industrial {{livestock}} husbandry {{is one of}} {{the most}} important industries in the field of providing nutrients. Nowadays, many branches of the science are applied in this industry, like genetic which is employed for improving the race of cattle. This science tries to transport good features from current generation to the next. Many researchers have reported that there is a meaningful correlation between facial type (physical form) and production. So, <b>type</b> <b>judging</b> {{is one of the}} best ways for evaluating useful features. This assessment contains those features that have maximum correlation for producing milk. Fulfilling of the form related to <b>type</b> <b>judging,</b> named Unified Score Card, needs very much experiences and skills. A judge (human expert) does this uncertainly with regarding to his experiences and skills. In this paper, possibility of developing of an expert system for replacing human expert is investigated. Also, the knowledge extraction methods are described. Fuzzy logic is used for dealing with uncertainty. Finally, the knowledge representation methods are discussed and fuzzy rule base is proposed for representing this knowledge...|$|E

30|$|The laptop is a MacBook Pro with an Intel i 7 2.7 GHz {{processor}} and 8 GB RAM, running an Ubuntu 14.04 64 -bit virtual machine. We obtained the source {{code of the}} data collection system from the authors of (Meng et al. 2013) and rebuilt their system. We then modified their system for our experiments. The main functions of the modified system include providing tasks for users to <b>type,</b> <b>judging</b> whether users’ inputs are correct and sending control information to the mobile phone via WiFi connection. A user interface is provided as a web page for users to type in passwords or PINs according to a prompt. When the system shows the prompt, it sends out a “start” message to the mobile phone at the same time. Upon receiving the message, the mobile phone also sends a “start” message to the smartwatch, which begins to record the sensor data. When the user presses “Enter” to finish the input, the system sends a “finish” message to the mobile phone and triggers it to send a “finish” message immediately to the smartwatch. The smartwatch terminates its recording of the sensor data and sends the recorded data to the phone. If the input password is incorrect or the user presses “backspace”, the user’s input is erased and the system sends a “restart” message {{to the phone and}} in turn to the smartwatch which restarts the recording of the sensor data.|$|E
40|$|Among {{numerous}} Streptomyces-strains {{isolated from}} soils, F 1001, so-called in our laboratory, exhibited the widest inhibition zone against pathogenic {{bacteria in the}} course of our screening-tests. The fact suggests that this strain has an ability to produce the antibiotic in a large amount. Spirals are formed at the ends of hyphae only on the agarmedia extremely poor in nutrients. The hyphae excrete brown pigments that diffuse into the media, when a protein component such as meat extract or peptone is added. From this the strain seems to be of Chromogenus <b>type.</b> <b>Judging</b> from several taxonomic characteristics, we have identified it as one strain of Streptomyces aureus (Waksman and Curtius) group. Cultivation of the strain on 6 kinds of media of different compositions showed the glucose bouillon medium, rendered semicolloidal by adding 0. 25 % agar, as most suitable for the production of antibiotics. Optimum pH of the broth for growth as well as for potency is 7. 0, and optimum temperature for growth is 24 ℃, while that for potency is 30 ℃. Broth filtrates inhibit the growth of Staph. aureus in about 20, 000, 000 dilution, E scher. coli in about 200, 000 dilution. Next we tried to extract active substances out of broth by the usual method and have got a white powder with pale yellowish brown tincture. As a solvent for elution of active substances from charcoal, methanol acidified by hydrochloric acid (pH 2) is excellent, and methanol acidified by sulfuric acid (same pH) falls behind. The powder gives brown colored Sakaguchi-reaction, and forms crystalline reineckate as well as helianthate. It is able to inhibit the growth of all the three groups of pathogenic bacteria i. e., Gram positive, Gram negative and acid-fast bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis bovine type). Lytic action upon bacterial bodies is not so conspicuous. Concerning heat stability, it is indifferent to 3 -minute heating at 100 ℃, while the potency decreases considerably by 5 -minute heating at 100 ℃...|$|E
40|$|This study {{draws on}} one of the four {{components}} of psychological type theory (the distinction between judging and perceiving attitudes toward the outside world) to examine the implications of these two contrasting psychological perspectives for shaping approaches to Christian ministry within an educational setting.

In this contribution, we argue that {{the potential of the}} approach is not yet fully tapped: Tasks need not to be “homogeneous”, i. e. {{there is no need to}} restrict a system e. g. to either “object classification ” or “gesture recognition”. Instead, qualitatively different problems like gesture recognition and scene evaluation can be handled simultaneously by the same system.

In the described scenario, the task is threefold: Recognition of object <b>types,</b> <b>judging</b> the stability of grasps on objects and hand gesture classification.

40|$|Abstract forbidding the {{redefinition}} of attribute types, inverting the routine argument redefinition rule to observe contravariance (redefined arguments {{should have more}} general <b>types),</b> <b>judging</b> <b>type</b> compatibility between parameterised types after replacing the type parameters and introducing an explicit type attribute scheme to handle Eiffel's anchored types. Contravariance is a counter-intuitive finding for subtyping models of inheritance because it prevents the uniform specialisation of function arguments and results. It forbids the replacement of a function f:τ→τ closed over a type τ by a function f:σ→σ closed over a subtype σ ⊆ τ [Cardelli 86]. While insisting that Eiffel should obey the contravariant rule, Cook ruefully admits that: Eiffel has too many polymorphic type mechanisms: conformance, generic and anchored types, {{some of which are}} flawed and others redundant. Cook's suggested 1989 corrections to Eiffel's type rules, most notably to make inheritance obey subtyping, were not accepted by Meyer, Eiffel's designer, who found them too restrictive. F-bounded polymorphism has since been widely proposed as an alternative to subtyping for describing the inherited self-type. Here, we adopt F-bounds for all polymorphic types in Eiffel, giving the flexibility Meyer wants. We analyse the intended expressiveness of conformance, anchored and generic types and show how these can all be replaced by a single, elegant parametric mechanism. "[Contravariance] has the unfortunate effect of making argument type redefinition almost useless, since it is usually not very useful to allow a redefined method to accept a larger class of arguments " [Cook 89 b, p 62]...|$|R
