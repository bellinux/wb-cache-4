5000|$|On 13 May 2016 {{the ferry}} Uriah Heep {{collided}} with the pier damaging the ferry's wheelhouse and requiring it to be withdrawn from service. [...] The Marine Accident Investigation Branch report concluded the loss of control leading to the collision was almost certainly from a mechanical failure within the hydraulic circuit that powered the <b>thrust</b> <b>deflector.</b> The report also noted the ferry berth at Hythe afforded little space to abort an approach {{in the event of}} a malfunction.|$|E
50|$|A key {{design feature}} of the Mirage IIIV to improve {{vertical}} flight performance was the installation of movable <b>thrust</b> <b>deflector</b> doors ahead of the nozzles set in the aircraft's underside. These would be inclined 45° rearwards while on the ground, dispersing both debris and hot gasses away from the aircraft. As the engines accelerated to full power, these doors would automatically drop to a 90° position {{in order to obtain}} maximum lift thrust is obtained. According to Flight International, the Mirage IIIV had an advertised performance envelope in the vicinity of Mach 1.15 when flown at low altitude and Mach 2.3 when flown at height.|$|E
50|$|As a {{considerable}} amount of company funds had already been spent on development, the project was continued to rework the design for another future aircraft project, the Armstrong Whitworth AW.681 VTOL military transport aircraft. The rear section of the engine was modified to incorporate an internal <b>thrust</b> <b>deflector</b> to duct exhaust gases through swivelling nozzles; an idea similar to that used on the contemporary Bristol Siddeley Pegasus. Cancellation of the AW.681 project however also brought to an end further development work on the Medway with attention turning to the smaller, but very closely related, Spey turbofan, the Spey being basically a scaled-down Medway incorporating more recent technical developments.|$|E
50|$|Bell {{constructed}} the X-14 as an open-cockpit, all-metal (duralumin) monoplane for the USAF. It was powered by two Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engines equipped with <b>thrust</b> <b>deflectors</b> sited at the aircraft's centre of gravity. The engines are fixed in position; transition from vertical to horizontal flight is achieved {{with a system}} of movable vanes that control the direction of engine thrust. Top speed was 180 miles per hour with a service ceiling of 20,000 feet. The X-14 was designed using existing parts from two Beechcraft aircraft: wings, ailerons, and landing gear of a Beech Bonanza and the tailcone and empennage of a Beech T-34 Mentor.|$|R
40|$|A thrust {{reverser}} is provided for both modulating and reversing bypass flow discharged from a fan through a bypass duct of a turbofan gas turbine engine. The reverser includes an aft cowl joined to a forward cowl and having an aft end surrounding a core engine {{to define a}} discharge fan nozzle of minimum flow throat area. The aft cowl is axially translatable relative to the forward cowl from a first position fully retracted against the forward cowl, to a second position partially extended from the forward cowl, and to a third position fully extended from the forward cowl. A plurality of cascade turning vanes are disposed between the forward and aft cowls, and a plurality of <b>thrust</b> reversing <b>deflector</b> doors are pivotally mounted to the aft cowl and bound the bypass duct. The deflector doors are selectively deployed from a stowed position corresponding with {{the first and second}} positions of the aft cowl for allowing unrestricted flow of the bypass flow through the fan nozzle. The doors also have a deployed position corresponding with the third position of the aft cowl for substantially deflecting the bypass flow from discharging through the fan nozzle to discharging through the cascade vanes for effecting thrust reverse. Axial translation of the aft cowl {{between the first and second}} positions varies flow area of the fan nozzle to vary thrust effected by the discharged bypass flow...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results from}} a swivel nozzle <b>thrust</b> <b>{{deflector}}</b> test program are presented. The deflector was installed behind a 36 -inch fan with a tip turbine hot gas drive. The maximum nozzle pressure ratio was 1. 2. Nozzle thrust and flow coefficients are presented {{for a range of}} vectoring angles. The results are also compared to small scale cold flow test results. The comparison suggests a need for accurate simulation of nozzle entry pressure and temperature profiles on model tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance degradation}} of a swivel nozzle <b>thrust</b> <b>deflector</b> system obtained during increased vectoring angles of a large-scale test program was investigated and improved. Small-scale models {{were used to}} generate performance data for analyzing selected swivel nozzle configurations. A single-swivel nozzle design model with five different nozzle configurations and a twin-swivel nozzle design model, scaled to 0. 15 size of the large-scale test hardware, were statically tested at low exhaust pressure ratios of 1. 4, 1. 3, 1. 2, and 1. 1 and vectored at four nozzle positions from 0 deg cruise through 90 deg vertical used for the VTOL mode...|$|E
40|$|The {{results and}} {{analysis}} of aerodynamic force data obtained from a small scale model of a V/STOL research vehicle in a low speed wind tunnel are presented. The {{analysis of the data}} includes the evaluation of aerodynamic-propulsive lift performance when operating twin ejector nozzles with thrust deflected. Three different types of <b>thrust</b> <b>deflector</b> systems were examined: 90 deg downward deflected nozzle, 90 deg slotted nozzle with boundary layer control, and an externally blown flap configuration. Several nozzle locations were tested, including over and underwing positions. The interference lift of the nacelle and model due to jet exhaust thrust is compared and results show that 90 deg turned nozzles located over the wing (near the trailing edge) produce the largest interference lift increment for an untrimmed aircraft, and that the slotted nozzle located under the wing near the trailing edge (in conjunction with a BLC flap) gives a comparable interference lift in the trimmed condition. The externally blown flap nozzle produced the least interference lift and significantly less total lift due to jet thrust effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{circulation}} control to deflect turbofan engine thrust beyond 90 deg. has been proven in full-scale static ground tests of the circulation-control-wing/upper-surface-blowing (CCW/USB) concept. This powered high-lift system employs a circular, blown trailing edge to replace the USB mechanical flaps to entrain engine-exhaust flow, and to obtain both a vertical-thrust component and an augmented circulation lift for short takeoff and landing (STOL) applications. Previous tests (Phase 1), done in 1982, of a basic configuration installed on the Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft confirmed these CCW/USB systems capabilities. A second phase (Phase 2) of full-scale, static, thrust-deflection investigations has reconfirmed the ability to deflect engine thrust from 40 to 102 deg., depending on thrust level. Five new configurations were evaluated and performance improvements noted for those configurations with larger blown span, fences or favorable engine interactions, smaller slot height, and larger radii with less than 180 deg. of CCW surface arc. In general, a 90 deg. circular arc with a smaller slot height provided the best performance, demonstrating that adequate thrust turning can be produced by a trailing-edge shape which may have minimal cruise-performance penalty. Thrust deflections were achieved at considerably lower blowing momentum than was required for the baseline case of Phase 1. Improved performance and versatility were thus confirmed for the CCW/USB system applied to STOL aircraft, where the potential for developing a non-moving-parts pneumatic <b>thrust</b> <b>deflector</b> to rapidly vary horizontal force from thrust to drag, while maintaining constant vertical force, appears quite promising. The conversion from high-lift to lower-drag cruise mode by merely terminating the blowing provides an effective STOL aircraft system...|$|E
