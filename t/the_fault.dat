5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fault,</b> {{which is}} aligned eastwest, is {{connected}} to the northsouth trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed monoclines, anticlines, and synclines, all of which suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era, when strike-slip faulting took place nearby. <b>The</b> <b>fault</b> runs along an ancient Precambrian terrane boundary. It was active mainly in the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian epochs around 300 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Alpine <b>Fault</b> is {{believed}} to align with <b>the</b> Macquarie <b>Fault</b> Zone in <b>the</b> Puysegur Trench off the southwestern corner of the South Island.

This set of <b>faults,</b> which includes <b>the</b> Wairau <b>Fault,</b> <b>the</b> Hope <b>Fault,</b> <b>the</b> Awatere <b>Fault,</b> and <b>the</b> Clarence <b>Fault,</b> transfer displacement between <b>the</b> Alpine <b>Fault</b> and <b>the</b> Hikurangi subduction zone to the north. <b>The</b> Hope <b>fault</b> is thought to represent the primary continuation of <b>the</b> Alpine <b>fault.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{is closely}} {{associated}} with <b>the</b> Hope <b>Fault</b> and Jordan Thrust at its south-easternmost edge and likely joins with <b>the</b> Clarence <b>Fault</b> to form <b>the</b> Wairarapa <b>Fault</b> offshore in Cook Strait.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was recorded}} on Gray-Milne-Ewing seismographs at weather observation stations at Gifu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo {{as well as}} a station housed at the Imperial University of Tokyo. Although the units went off scale after 8.5 seconds at Gifu and 13.5 seconds at Nagoya (probably due to an inundation of large S-waves) the seismograms they produced have been beneficial for seismologists to develop an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> rupture process.

40|$|Abstract.

5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg. This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. <b>The</b> <b>fault</b> is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe focal {{mechanism}} of the destructive earthquake at Rudbar in northern Iran on 1990 June 20 was an unexpected left-lateral strike-slip motion on a previously unknown <b>fault,</b> <b>the</b> Baklor–Kabateh–Zard-Goli <b>fault,</b> within a complex system of reverse faults. We analysed microseismicity recorded by a dense local network deployed for 7 weeks, 8 yr after the main shock, to help evaluate the subsurface geometry and kinematics of <b>the</b> active <b>fault</b> system. In <b>the</b> west, the 1998 microseismicity seems {{to be related to}} the reverse Manjil. In the centre, we observe both reverse <b>faulting</b> associated to <b>the</b> Manjil <b>fault</b> and strike-slip faulting associated with de Zard-Goli rupture whose dip progressively changes from 45 °N to vertical. In the east, <b>the</b> reverse <b>faulting</b> is located south of <b>the</b> Manjil <b>fault</b> and strike-slip <b>faulting</b> to <b>the</b> vertical Zard-Goli <b>fault.</b> We suggest that because the only stable geometry that accommodates large partitioning motion prevents <b>the</b> strike-slip <b>fault</b> to intersect <b>the</b> reverse <b>fault,</b> <b>the</b> active reverse <b>fault</b> jumps southwards beneath <b>the</b> Shahrud <b>fault...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Imperial Valley is {{surrounded}} by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms.

The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events.
