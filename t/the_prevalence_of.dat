40|$|Introduction: Adolescence is a {{stressful}} period due to physical, psychological, sexual changes, {{and the presence}} of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress at this stage of life is a matter of concern. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress among higher secondary school students of Imphal and to determine the association between depression, anxiety, and stress and selected variables such as gender, standard, and religion. Materials and methods: From September 2014 to October 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted among higher secondary school students of Imphal. The sample size was calculated to be 750. Seven schools were randomly selected, and all the students in that school were enrolled in the study. The study tool used was a questionnaire containing DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress among 830 valid respondents were 19. 5 %, 24. 4 %, and 21. 1 %, respectively. In total, 81. 6 % of the respondents had {{at least one of the}} studied disorders and 34. 7 % of the respondents had all the three negative states. <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress were high among females and were significant for anxiety (P = 0. 00) and stress (P = 0. 04). <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression and stress were significantly higher among 12 th standard students with P-values of 0. 00 and 0. 02. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and stress were high with anxiety and stress significantly higher among females, whereas <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> depression and stress were significantly higher among 12 th standard students.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between May and December of 2012 and involving {{adolescents in the}} 13 - to 14 -year age bracket. Participants were randomly selected from among adolescents studying at public schools in Belo Horizonte and completed the ISAAC questionnaire. Proportions were calculated in order to assess <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the sample as a whole, and the chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used in order to compare <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> observed in 2012 with those found in 2002. Results: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in 2012 were 19. 8 %, 35. 3 %, and 16. 3 %, respectively, being significantly higher than those found in 2002 (asthma, p = 0. 006; allergic rhinitis, p < 0. 01; and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, p = 0. 002). Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> <b>of</b> asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis among adolescents in 2012 were found to be high, having increased in comparison with those found 10 years earlier, despite efforts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment...|$|R
