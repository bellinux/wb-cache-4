50|$|Wire wrap {{construction}} {{can produce}} assemblies {{which are more}} reliable than printed circuits: connections are less prone to fail due to vibration or physical stresses on the base board, {{and the lack of}} solder precludes soldering faults such as corrosion, cold joints and dry joints. The connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical resistance due to cold welding of the wire to the <b>terminal</b> <b>post</b> at the corners.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to insert wiring without the proper tool, but this requires great care to avoid damaging the connectors. For example, pushing a screwdriver {{down the middle of}} the block is a bad practice as it forces the two blades of the <b>terminal</b> <b>post</b> apart, leading to bad contacts. It is also possible to punch-down multiple wires on top of each other in a single post of a punch-down block, but this practice is discouraged because of reliability concerns. If these multiple wires are of different thicknesses (wire gauges), it is even more likely that the thinner wire will develop contact problems. Similarly, stranded wire can be used on punch-down blocks, even though they were originally designed for solid wire connections.|$|E

5000|$|The {{installation}} of chain-link fence involves setting posts {{into the ground}} and attaching the fence to them. The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete. End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as [...] "terminal posts", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence. Posts set between the <b>terminal</b> <b>posts</b> are called [...] "line posts" [...] and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by [...] "unscrewing" [...] a wire. Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts with aluminum wire. In many cases, the installer stretches a bottom tension wire, sometimes referred to as [...] "coil wire", between <b>terminal</b> <b>posts</b> to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs {{at the bottom of the}} chain-link mesh between posts. Top horizontal rails are used on most chain-link fences, although not necessary. Bottom rails may be added in lieu of bottom tension wires, and for taller fences, 10 feet or more, intermediate horizontal rails are often added.|$|R

However, {{for most of}} existing systems, you may only find design documents without requirement specification. This paper presents an ontology-based reengineering approach to recovering requirements from existing systems. The proposed approach consists of three main parts: ontology development, ontology mapping and derivation of the requirements. Domain ontology is used to model domain specific requirements and program ontology is used to present system structure and behaviour. The algorithm of ontology mapping is developed to match domain ontology and program ontology for requirement recovery. A case study of Point of Sale <b>Terminal</b> (<b>POST)</b> system is used to illustrate the approach. Conclusions are drawn and further research directions are advocated...|$|E

40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal. An analysis of several cable guardrail end terminals was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension cable end terminal designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current cable terminal anchor hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative cable anchor designs. A final, optimized, high-tension cable anchor design was produced along with alternative <b>terminal</b> <b>post</b> recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension cable end terminal.

50|$|<b>Terminal</b> Railway <b>Post</b> Offices (Term RPO) {{were started}} in nearly 100 cities in late 1913 and 1914, {{primarily}} to help handle {{the increase in}} volume of parcel post which was overwhelming the main transportation system. These terminals also came to distribute transit parcel post, circulars, magazines, and papers - mail that was generally considered less urgent than first class letters. Letter cases were used at many terminals {{to take care of}} advance work or unworked letters from Railway Post Office (RPO) routes, while a few <b>terminals</b> handled parcel <b>post</b> almost exclusively. The largest <b>terminal</b> railway <b>post</b> office was the Penn Terminal in the G.P.O. Building in New York City, New York—in 1951, it had over 1,100 clerks. Penn Terminal handled advance work for many of the railway post office routes leaving New York City. By comparison, the West Side Terminal, located along the New York Central line near the Hudson River piers, handled parcel post almost exclusively. Because parcel post transportation was generally by rail, most terminal RPOs were housed in or adjacent to the railroad station.|$|R

50|$|The Blindicide {{was also}} {{produced}} in a 100 mm version (the RL-100). The 83mm version fired a 1.6 kilogram projectile with a 0.5 kg warhead, while the 100 mm version fired a 2.75 kg projectile. The {{rate of fire}} was six rounds per minute and the range 400 meters for both versions. This rate of fire was considerably {{in excess of the}} M20A1 Bazooka since Blindicide used a mechanical firing pin hitting a percussion cap in the tail of the rocket motor rather than a hand grip magneto system that required trailing wires from each rocket to be connected to <b>terminal</b> <b>posts</b> on the launcher as each round was loaded. The muzzle velocity of both versions varied, with the 83 mm version firing at 100 m/s while the 100 mm version fired at 195 m/s.

40|$|Long-span {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been recognized as {{an effective means of}} shielding low-fill culverts while minimizing construction efforts and limiting culvert damage and repair. The current MGS long-span design provided the capability to span unsupported lengths up to 25 ft (7. 6 m) without the use of nested guardrail. The excellent performance of the MGS long-span system in full-scale crash tests suggested that longer span lengths may be possible with the current design. A detailed analysis of the MGS long-span guardrail system was performed using the finite element software program LS-DYNA®. It was shown that the MGS long-span design had the potential for satisfying MASH TL- 3 evaluation criteria at increased span lengths of 31 ¼ ft (9. 5 m) and 37 ½ ft (11. 4 m). Further increasing the span length led to questionable vehicle capture and severe impacts into the culvert wingwall. It was determined that the 31 ¼-ft (9. 5 -m) span MGS long-span system would proceed to full-scale crash testing. A critical impact study identified two impact locations that (1) evaluated the structural capacity of the guardrail system and (2) maximized the vehicle’s extent over the culvert and potential for vehicle instabilities. Ultimately, the sponsors decided to perform full-scale crash testing with Universal Steel Breakaway Posts in lieu of Controlled Release <b>Terminal</b> <b>posts</b> to determine their suitability with the MGS long-span guardrail system. Prior full-scale crash testing indicated that the post-to-guardrail bolt connections were sensitive to the MGS long-span design. A simulation study investigated several techniques to improve the modeling of these bolted connections. Advisor: John D. Rei...|$|R
