2500|$|The Preface of [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] {{began by}} {{explaining}} {{that it was}} printed [...] "at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, {{and as far as}} the author's own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed poetic merits". The preface then provided an origin to both the poem and why it was merely a smaller portion of an intended larger work. After reading from Purchas's book, [...] "The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he had the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two or three hundred lines ... On Awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> preserved." [...] The image of himself that Coleridge provides is of a dreamer who reads works of lore and not as an opium addict. Instead, the effects of the opium, as described, are intended to suggest that he was not used to its effects.|$|E
2500|$|The Author {{continued}} {{for about three}} hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external senses, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, {{that he could not}} have composed less than from two to three hundred lines; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, without any sensation or consciousness of effort. On awakening he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> preserved. At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone had been cast, but, alas! without the after restoration of the latter: ...|$|E
2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was very upset about the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E
