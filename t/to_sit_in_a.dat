5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} to stand for the consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as the}} dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped. In 366BC, in an effort by the patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E

25|$|In June 1840, Mott {{attended}} the General Anti-Slavery Convention, {{better known as}} the World's Anti-Slavery Convention, in London, England. In spite of Mott's status as one of six women delegates, before the conference began, the men voted to exclude the American women from participating, and the female delegates were required <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> segregated area. Anti-slavery leaders didn't want the women's rights issue to become associated with the cause of ending slavery worldwide and dilute the focus on abolition. In addition, the social mores of the time generally prohibited women's participation in public political life. Several of the American men attending the convention, including William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, protested the women's exclusion. Garrison, Nathaniel Peabody Rogers, William Adam, and African American activist Charles Lenox Remond sat with the women in the segregated area.|$|E
25|$|Tipu's {{persecution}} of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, {{there were a}} significant amount of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ghagra cholis and entertain the court as nautch girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair and use a knife and fork.

25|$|There are {{different}} views on optimal timing of surgery after a spinal cord injury. The general consensus is {{to operate the}} patient {{when he or she}} is neurologically stable. Some surgeons try to operate a patient as early as possible. The advantages of this are that the patient {{can take advantage of the}} new functional possibilities before new adjustments and apaptations develop. Other surgeons operate when it becomes feasible. This is usually 12–18 months after injury (can be shortened to 6–7 months) and only after stabilization of motor function. Important spasticity (see further) and neurovegetative complications (i.e. bladder function, bowel function, pulmonary function and pressure sores) must have been treated already. The patient must be able <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair so that he/she can move the arm against gravity. Usually a compromise is found between the patient’s wishes and the surgeon when timing the surgery.|$|E

25|$|The city {{continued}} to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the City Hall by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the City War Memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to housing stock in the city centre. Much of the replacement postwar stock was designed by the local authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was {{the opening of the}} University of East Anglia in 1964. Originally designed by Denys Lasdun (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as Norman Foster and Rick Mather.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} by Lieutenant General Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle on 25 April 1922, using the novel {{method of pressing}} an electric button. The remaining funds were spent on drums and bugles for the regiment and donated to the Lancashire Fusiliers' compassionate fund. After the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968, the memorial {{was adopted by the}} new regiment and rededicated to all fusiliers killed in action. It originally sat outside the Lancashire Fusiliers' headquarters in Wellington Barracks but the barracks closed in the 1970s and the memorial was relocated. It was relocated again in 2009, this time <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public park renamed Gallipoli Gardens, outside the Fusilier Museum, which moved at the same time. The memorial was designated a grade II listed building in 1992. It was upgraded to grade II* in 2015 (on the centenary of the Cape Helles landing), along with two other memorials related to the Gallipoli Campaign; later that year it formed part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.|$|E

25|$|Mondino was {{the first}} to {{incorporate}} a systematic study of anatomy and dissection into a medical curriculum. The dissection of human cadavers was a hallmark of the Alexandrian school, but declined after 200 A.D. due to legal and religious proscriptions. These bans were eventually lifted, allowing Mondino to perform his first public dissection in Bologna in January 1315 in the presence of medical students and other spectators. The proceedings were formally sanctioned by the Vatican, and the subject was mostly likely a female executed criminal. It was common practice for the professor of anatomy <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large, ornate chair elevated above the dissection proceedings, reading from an anatomical text and providing commentary, while a demonstrator, or surgeon, physically performed the dissection. Additionally, an ostensor was present to point out the specific parts of the body that were being examined. Mondino's teaching methods were unique because he often performed dissections in person and served the role of demonstrator himself, carefully studying the cadaver and incorporating this personal experience into his text and teaching.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American sheet metal worker, Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 white sheet metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited sheet metal worker, and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E

Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.|$|E
