5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to the protein's function.|$|E
5|$|The humanists {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{to transcend}} to the afterlife {{with a perfect}} mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism {{was to create a}} universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a good actor. Marge tells Lisa <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E

5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to know when to end a story, {{that he did not want}} the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{to know when to}} end a story, {{that he did not want}} the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E

25|$|Some {{educators}} {{hold the}} view that sexuality is equated with violence. These educators think that not talking about sexuality will decrease the rate of adolescent sexuality.

25|$|Family-based {{treatment}} (FBT) {{has been}} shown to be more successful than individual therapy for adolescents with AN. Various forms of family-based treatment have been proven to work in the treatment of adolescent AN including conjoint family therapy (CFT), in which the parents and child are seen together by the same therapist, and separated family therapy (SFT) in which the parents and child attend therapy separately with different therapists.

25|$|Despite the {{suggested}} model, research advises {{that the process}} of self-forgiveness is not always applicable for every individual. For example, individuals who have not actually caused others any harm or wrongdoing, but instead are suffering from negative emotions such as self-hatred or self-pity, such as victims of assault, might attempt self-forgiveness for their perceived offences. However, this would not be the process necessary for them to make their amends. Additionally, offenders who continue to offend others while attempting to forgive themselves for past offences demonstrate a reluctance to genuinely complete the four stages necessary for self-forgiveness. Research suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to first gather exterior information about the individual's perceived offences as well as their needs and motivation for self-forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not aging {{directly}} affects women's sexual functioning during menopause {{is another}} area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically {{in the areas of}} desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning. This means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire. Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status. Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status can have on quality of life is often underestimated.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to depression, {{victims of domestic}} violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive images, exaggerated startle response, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse. Studies have indicated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.|$|E

When the candidates were asked who they would consider as the next Secretary of the Treasury, John McCain said that he might concur with Obama's suggestion of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and then went on also to suggest former eBay president Meg Whitman. Barack Obama reiterated the mention of Buffett and said there are also many other qualified Americans. Both candidates said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to choose as Treasury Secretary someone who earns the trust of the American people.

25|$|CP {{is not a}} {{progressive}} disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood {{if he or she}} receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required. The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP will often not be known until the child starts school. People with CP {{are more likely to have}} learning disabilities, although these may be unrelated to IQ, including varying degrees of intellectual disability. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually impaired, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn.|$|E
