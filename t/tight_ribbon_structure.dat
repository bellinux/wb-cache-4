50|$|In {{the eastern}} part of Ovda, the {{structural}} setting is defined mainly by wide folds and <b>ribbons</b> <b>structures.</b> The wide folds are observed to have amplitudes up to 25 km and several hundred km in length. While the <b>ribbons</b> <b>structures</b> generally hold a radial pattern. Some of the <b>ribbons</b> <b>structures</b> on this part of Ovda are quite difficult to interpret due to the SAR images' limited resolution. A good number of grabens are also present in this part, although the grabens are not highly distinguishable and are limited to fold crests.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{mammalian}} cells, individual Golgi stacks fuse laterally to {{form the}} characteris-tic perinuclear <b>ribbon</b> <b>structure.</b> Yet {{the purpose of this}} remarkable structure has been an enigma. We report that breaking down the ribbon of mammalian cells strongly inhibits intra-Golgi transport of large cargoes without altering the rate of transport of smaller cargoes. In addition, insect cells that naturally harbor dispersed Golgi stacks have limited capacity to transport artificial oversized cargoes. These results imply that the <b>ribbon</b> <b>structure</b> is an es-sential requirement for transport of large cargoes in mammalian cells, and we suggest that this is because it enables the dilated rims of cisternae (containing the aggregates) to move across the stack as they transfer among adjacent stacks within the <b>ribbon</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{ab initio}} band {{structure}} of 2 D graphene sheet is well reproduced {{by the third}} nearest neighbor tight binding model proposed by Reich et al [Phys. Rev. B 66, 035412]. For <b>ribbon</b> <b>structures,</b> the existing sets of tight binding parameters can successfully explain semi-conducting behavior of all armchair <b>ribbon</b> <b>structures.</b> However, they are still failing in describing accurately {{the slope of the}} bands while this feature is directly associated to the group velocity and the effective mass of electrons. In this work, both density functional theory and tight binding calculations were performed and a new set of tight binding parameters up to the third nearest neighbors including overlap terms is introduced. The results obtained with this model offer excellent agreement with the predictions of the density functional theory in most cases of <b>ribbon</b> <b>structures,</b> even in the high-energy region. Moreover, this set can induce electron-hole asymmetry as manifested in density functional theory. Relevant outcomes are also demonstrated for armchair ribbons of various widths as well as for zigzag structures, thus opening a route for multi-scale simulations.

40|$|Graphene has {{captured}} the imagination of researchers worldwide as a perfect two-dimensional material with exceptional electrical transport properties. The high electron and hole mobility quickly inspired scientists to search for electronic applications that require high performance channel materials. However, the absence of a bandgap in graphene immediately revealed itself in terms of ambipolar device characteristics and the non-existence of a device off-state – features not commonly shared with conventional semiconductors for electronic device applications in the past decades.
