5|$|Highway55 passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> town of Virgil, {{which is}} centred on the Four Mile Creek. It intersected Four Mile Creek Road (Niagara Regional Road100) in {{the centre of}} the town, then entered back into an {{agricultural}} area. Shortly thereafter, the highway entered the urban area of Niagara-on-the-Lake, where it ended at Mary Street (Niagara Regional Road87).|$|E
5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They {{had been left behind}} by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> of his back, and the wound was not serious.|$|E
5|$|NY99 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY30 {{west of the}} hamlet of Duane Center {{in the town of}} Duane. The route headed eastward as the Port Kent–Hopkinton Turnpike, passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> community of Duane Center before entering an isolated, wooded area of Franklin County and Adirondack Park. At the Franklin town line, NY99 curved southeastward, roughly paralleling Hatch Brook as it climbed up the northeastern portion of Baldface Mountain. Past the mountain's summit, the route continued onward, winding its way southward along Hatch Brook to a small lake known as Duck Pond.|$|E
50|$|A typical gauge {{used when}} making tennis balls would have two holes, one {{slightly}} larger than the other. A manufactured object passes the go/no go test if it goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> large hole but does not go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> hole; <b>the</b> object fails if it passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> hole, or does not pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> large hole.|$|R

50|$|A {{suitable}} sieve {{size for}} the aggregate underneath the {{nest of sieves}} to collect the aggregate that passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest.</b> <b>The</b> entire nest is then agitated, and the material whose diameter is <b>smaller</b> than <b>the</b> mesh opening pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sieves. After the aggregate reaches the pan, the amount of material retained in each sieve is then weighed.|$|R
5|$|Then, SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley, running {{concurrently}} {{with it for}} a brief distance. Shortly {{after passing}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> community of Glamis, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve. As it nears the Colorado River and the Arizona border, SR78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde, where the river {{turns away from the}} highway and SR78 enters Riverside County.|$|E
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|F-41 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US23 {{on the north}} side of Oscoda. The route travels to the northwest away from town, passing between Van Etten Lake and what was previously Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The road continues north through a rural area of Alcona County on Somers and Mikado roads, running parallel, but inland, to the Lake Huron shoreline. It passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> communities of Mikado and Gustin before coming to a junction with M-72. After crossing M-72, F-41 turns east into the community of Lincoln along Traverse Bay State Road, 2nd Street and Main Street before leaving town to the north. The road continues on to the north on Barlow Road through Alcona County before terminating at a second junction with US23. The highway travels through wooded terrain along its routing.|$|E

60|$|Marguerite herself, {{released}} for {{a moment}} from her constant duties near her royal guests, had strolled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> rooms, accompanied by Juliette, in order to search for Mademoiselle Candeille and to suggest the commencement of the improvised concert.|$|R
5|$|NY474 {{begins at}} the Pennsylvania state line {{in the town of}} French Creek as a {{continuation}} of PA474, which in turn begins a short distance west of the state line in Wattsburg, Pennsylvania. NY474 heads east through rural southwest Chautauqua County, briefly paralleling French Creek to the hamlet of Marvin before intersecting and briefly overlapping with NY426 <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hamlet of Cutting. NY474 exits Cutting and continues on an easterly track into the town of Clymer and the hamlet of the same name, where it meets County Route15 (CR15), a local road leading from the Pennsylvania state line (where the road continues south to Corry) north to Sherman {{in the center of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|NY990V begins {{northwest}} of the Schoharie Reservoir at an intersection with NY30 {{in the town of}} Gilboa. The route heads northeast around the reservoir as a two-lane highway, intersecting CR13 (Stryker Road) in an area of open fields before crossing Schoharie Creek a short distance downstream from the Gilboa Dam. On the opposite bank of the creek, the highway quickly passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hamlet of Gilboa, located at a junction with CR17 (Flat Creek Road). Outside of Gilboa, NY990V turns to the southeast, paralleling {{the eastern edge of the}} reservoir as it runs through a stretch of forests and passes directly south of Gilboa-Conesville Central School. The wooded areas give way to slightly more open terrain in the adjacent town of Conesville, where the route meets CR39 (Prattsville Road) just east of the town line. CR39 heads south from this point, taking over as the primary waterside roadway while NY990V heads east into a valley surrounding Manor Kill.|$|E
5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past the airport {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other. The large aerospace contractor Calspan has its headquarters here, and Westinghouse once operated a large industrial lathe plant on the airport side of the road (it was torn down when the airport was rebuilt in the late 1990s). Beyond the airport, the divider ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short curve and minimal descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster. After this junction, the highway becomes a two-lane route once again <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hamlet of Bowmansville, where it crosses Ellicott Creek near some rapids.|$|E
50|$|However, {{not only}} the central cities in the empire grew. Because of the {{increased}} amount of traffic <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> cities along trade routes, these once isolated cities grew too, creating a fairly consistent amount of growth throughout the Post-Classic period.|$|R
5000|$|Ejector system - The {{cutting tool}} is a tube with another tube nested inside. Coolant flows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> tube to <b>the</b> cutting face and then coolant and chips flow back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> larger tube. This {{is only an}} {{acceptable}} technology for holes of over 18.4 mm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>smallest</b> pen needles {{are very}} short and very thin and help {{minimize}} the discomfort of injection. Because of their bigger inner diameters, larger diameter pen needles help large dose volumes to flow {{more quickly and}} with less manual strength <b>through</b> <b>the</b> needle. Proprietary Thin-Wall Technology is used by BD Medical to facilitate flow even <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> needles with minimal extra force.|$|R
5|$|Past Duck Pond, {{the route}} {{turned to the}} southeast, passing {{by a series of}} small ponds and {{crossing}} under an old railroad grade as it ran along the base of a series of peaks known as the Loon Lake Mountains. NY99 continued to follow the range to the northwestern edge of Loon Lake, where it veered to the northeast and ran along the northern and eastern shores of the lake to the hamlet of Loon Lake at its southeastern tip. NY99 passed generally northwest–southeast <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> lakeside community before reentering another sparsely developed area of the town of Franklin. The highway progressed southeastward, crossing over the northern branch of the Saranac River and passing through the largely undeveloped community of Merrillsville before ending at an intersection with NY3.|$|E
5|$|Recreational Road 255 {{begins at}} its western {{terminus}} at an intersection with U.S. Route 69 as a two-lane, paved road. The highway proceeds eastward through mainly rural areas, passing several small farms. The roadway continues, intersecting County Route 3251 (CR 3251) and turning northeast. The road proceeds northeast before slowly bending east again and continuing. It proceeds <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> community of Oak Grove and turns northeasterly. RE 255 continues, passing several homes {{and the small}} Gregory Cemetery as well as intersecting several county roads and slowly bending east. The route continues easterly, passing through a large forest and intersecting CR 3725 before crossing the Neches River and exiting Tyler County.|$|E
5|$|SR 275 {{began as}} part of Legislative Route 6, one of the shorter main routes of the initial system funded by the 1910 bond issue. This highway, which {{included}} the several-mile-long Yolo Causeway, connected Sacramento with the northsouth Route 7 at Davis, thereby linking the capital city with the San Francisco Bay Area. Route 6 traffic initially left Sacramento on the 1911 I Street Bridge, heading southwest <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> settlement of Washington via D Street, 5th Street, and present Tower Court to West Capitol Avenue. The state highway {{was moved to the}} M Street Bridge in 1926, {{as part of}} an improvement that also took it through a two-lane subway under the Sacramento Northern Railroad, still present on West Capitol Avenue. The M Street Bridge was replaced by the Tower Bridge in 1935.|$|E

50|$|The MacArthur Lock, {{built in}} 1943. It is 800 ft long, 80 ft wide, and 29.5 ft deep. This {{is large enough}} to handle ocean-going vessels ("salties") that must also pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> locks in <b>the</b> Welland Canal. <b>The</b> first vessel <b>through</b> was <b>the</b> SS Carl D.

5|$|NY383 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY36 in the hamlet of Mumford, located {{just north of}} the border between Monroe and Livingston Counties in the town of Wheatland. Taking on the name Scottsville–Mumford Road, NY383 follows Oatka Creek east through open fields and passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hamlet of Garbutt {{on its way to the}} village of Scottsville, where it becomes Caledonia Avenue. At an intersection with the southern terminus of NY386, NY383 turns east onto Main Street and follows it through the residential southern portion of the village and past the Scottsville Free Library. Main Street comes to an end at a junction with River Road (NY251, which has its western terminus here) and Rochester Street near the northern bank of Oatka Creek. Here, NY383 curves north onto Rochester Street and proceeds through eastern Scottsville. The street name of NY383 becomes Scottsville Road upon intersecting the western terminus of NY253. Past this junction, the surroundings shift from village streets to housing tracts as the route exits Scottsville. North of the village, NY383 re-enters open fields once again upon crossing the Wheatland–Chili town line.|$|E
5|$|Signage for SR 67 {{begins at}} Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. ADOT does not officially own {{this section of}} road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> town of North Rim, {{surrounded}} by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway {{is surrounded by a}} narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an unpaved National Forest road. The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of Grand Canyon Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several turns as it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
50|$|Arch: The North Georgia Arch {{is located}} at the campus {{entrance}} near Dahlonega's town square. It was built by the Class of 1951 to commemorate their classmates who died in the Korean War. Tradition holds that freshmen are not to walk <b>through</b> <b>the</b> larger archway. Instead, they are supposed to walk <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> adjacent archway.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, Palladio can {{be given}} credit for having {{inspired}} the remarkable perspectives which are visible to <b>the</b> audience <b>through</b> <b>the</b> central archway of the scaenae frons (also known as the [...] "porta reggia") and also <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> side openings. But it is also appropriate to regard Scamozzi as the technical genius behind their remarkably successful execution.|$|R

5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Ohio River {{a third time}} back into Indiana and across the {{southern}} fringes of Evansville. Here, the tornado ripped directly through the Eastbrook Mobile Home Park, obliterating numerous mobile homes and killing 20 people. Of about 350 mobile homes in the park, 100 were destroyed and another 125 were damaged. The coroner reported {{that most of the}} victims were probably killed instantly, many by spine and skull fractures. Several bodies were carried almost two hundred yards. The tornado then crossed into Warrick County, Indiana at the Angel Mounds State Historic Site. Several permanent homes were destroyed in this area, along with many others {{on the north side of}} Newburgh. Past Newburgh, the tornado reached its peak intensity (high-end F3) as it tore through an industrial park near Paradise. Further northeast, the tornado passed just south of Boonville and caused a fatality in a mobile home. The tornado then tore directly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> community of DeGonia Springs, tossing vehicles and destroying homes. Some of the homes in the community were leveled, and three people were killed in a mobile home in this area. The tornado began to rapidly weaken as it passed just south of Tennyson, and then dissipated as it crossed into Spencer County, Indiana. Overall, the tornado damaged or destroyed 500 buildings, killed 25 people, and injured 230 others.|$|E

50|$|The second {{procession}} {{occurs at}} 8 p.m. on Good Friday and reflects the Madonna's mourning as she finds her son dead. Hundreds of participants, dressed {{this time in}} hooded black gowns, march down Corso Italia and then wind <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> lanes of Sorrento. This second procession is much larger and better attended.|$|R
50|$|Mic City Sons is the band's only {{recording}} {{for a major}} label. However, {{when individuals}} at Virgin Records learned the band {{might be on the}} verge of disbanding, the album was subsequently licensed for release <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> sister independent label Caroline Records (also an EMI subsidiary) and their independent distributor of the same name.|$|R
50|$|Glacial Lake Drumheller {{abandoned}} the Strathmore Channel at 945m, whereupon discharge was directed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> Crowfoot channel until 915m. At this elevation, flow {{must have been}} diverted further to the east, over the Bassano basin.
