25|$|In {{its early}} years, the Talune was {{involved}} in two recorded salvage operations. In 1898, it rendered assistance to the SS Ruapehu, stranded on Farewell Spit. In 1899 the Talune fell in with the 5,500-ton 'Perthshire', which had gone missing on a voyage from Sydney to Wellington. For eight weeks, the Perthshire had been drifting helplessly without power in the Tasman Sea with a broken <b>tailshaft.</b> The Talune towed the larger ship back to Sydney.|$|E
25|$|From 1975, {{a pickup}} {{version of the}} Moke was produced, with a 1.45x1.50metre (55x59in) drop-sided bed which {{protruded}} behind {{the back of the}} vehicle, and a cloth top over the cab area. At least two four-wheel drive Moke prototypes were manufactured by Leyland Australia in the late 1970s, but unlike the British version, these used just one engine. Leyland were planning to market this version, but Moke production in Australia ended in 1981 and all that remains of the project is one of the prototypes which is now owned by an enthusiast in Western Australia and a modified differential crownwheel with gearteeth cut in the side to drive the rear <b>tailshaft,</b> in the personal collection of a Melbourne Mini specialist.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front <b>tailshaft</b> removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
2500|$|Trawler Robert Limbrick, ashore Quinish Point, Mull: Survey shows vessel {{lying on}} port side, which not visible but damage to this side {{suspected}} extensive. Starboard side {{so far as}} visible severely damaged from forecastle to stem. Shell plating fractured from bulwark to keel and badly holed in way of fish hold also abreast of bridge. Deck fractured abreast of fish hold, stern frame broken, rudder missing, suspect propeller and <b>tailshaft</b> badly damaged. Engine-room and hull flooded and lifeboat badly stove in. Forward portion of vessel flexing with action of sea where fractured, not possible to board. Consider salvage impracticable. Further SW gales will accelerate vessel breaking up.|$|E
50|$|Identical to the Toyota A44DL {{except with}} {{different}} <b>tailshaft</b> housings and <b>tailshaft</b> flanges, {{both of which}} are interchangeable.|$|E
5000|$|Bill Thomas Cheetah (used {{only one}} {{universal}} joint between transmission <b>tailshaft</b> housing and differential housing) ...|$|E
50|$|The name 4R44E means 4 forward gears, {{rear-drive}} platform (or 4WD, with {{a different}} <b>tailshaft</b> housing), rated for 440 ft/lb torque (after torque converter multiplication) and electronic shifting. 4R55E is the same but heavier duty and rated for 550 ft·lbs.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{introduced}} with a four-speed gearbox which featured synchromesh {{on the top}} three ratios with no syncro on 1st gear, this gearbox {{was based on the}} reliant regal but had an extended <b>tailshaft</b> with a linkage for the gearstick.|$|E
50|$|The ATTESA E-TS version uses {{a mostly}} {{conventional}} RWD transmission. Drive {{to the rear}} wheels is constant via a <b>tailshaft</b> and rear differential, but drive to the front wheels is more complex by utilizing a transfer case on {{the rear of the}} transmission.|$|E
50|$|Sovereign {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} refit {{in the mid-1990s}} and was rededicated in January 1997. Cracks were discovered in the <b>tailshaft</b> during post-refit sea trials and she was sent to Rosyth for 14 weeks of emergency repairs in June 1998 before returning to Faslane.|$|E
50|$|For 1995, Allan Grice {{was signed}} to drive, but the {{relationship}} ended {{before the end of}} the championship. Tony Scott drove at a few rounds, being joined by Steven Ellery at the Sandown 500 and John Cleland at the Bathurst 1000 where despite having to replace a <b>tailshaft,</b> the team finished sixth.|$|E
50|$|Borg-Warner/Quadra-Trac {{overdrive}} {{was available}} from early 1960 to 1969. The Borg-Warner overdrive case is 11¾ inches long (less torque tube adapter, if required), including the 1+1/2 in adapter. A complete T96 with overdrive is 18¾ inches long from front of case to end of <b>tailshaft</b> housing. The overdrive unit {{is the same}} for all.|$|E
50|$|The Type 9 was Ford's first five-speed, rear-wheel-drive gearbox, and it {{is based}} on the four-speed Type E gearbox. The fifth, or {{overdrive}} gear, was added to the four-speed gearbox by placing it in the extension housing or <b>tailshaft</b> housing. This made production easier and cheaper but effectively limited torque capacity to 200 lb. ft. or so.|$|E
50|$|The {{return spring}} is {{calibrated}} such {{that a given}} revolution speed of the cable corresponds to a specific speed indication on the speedometer. This calibration {{must take into account}} several factors, including ratios of the <b>tailshaft</b> gears that drive the flexible cable, the final drive ratio in the differential, and the diameter of the driven tires.|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm {{just really}} stunned for words, I can't believe the reception. I thought Australian race fans {{had a lot}} more to go than this, this is bloody disgraceful. I'll keep racing but I tell you what, this is going to remain with me for a long time, you're a pack of arseholes." [...] Channel Seven's Gary Wilkinson then told Richards he could give the unruly crowd a {{champagne}} bath, to which Richards replied [...] "I wouldn't bother." [...] Jim Richards' infamous post race comment. Nine time Bathurst winner Peter Brock had his worst ever start to the race when the <b>tailshaft</b> of his new VP Commodore broke on the starting line. After sitting {{on the side of the}} circuit for a number of laps, the car was eventually towed into the pits where the Mobil 1 crew fitted a new <b>tailshaft</b> while Brock explained to the television audience that it was a brand new tail shaft fitted that morning that had broken. Brock, whose co-driver was German DTM driver and winner of the 1989 24 Hours of Le Mans, Manuel Reuter, rejoined the race on lap 15 in last position. After later breaking a second <b>tailshaft</b> and being pushed into a spin at Forrest's Elbow during the first rain storm by the Holden Racing Team Commodore of Allan Grice which forced Brock to pit when Grice pushed past and ground the front spoiler off of the Mobil 1 Commodore (causing Brock to vent on television about Grice's driving in a rare show of emotion), Brock and Reuter finished in 27th place.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "S4 Special" [...] was {{introduced}} in September 1963 for racing homologation purposes (a minimum of 100 were required to be built & sold). These featured a 179 engine, manual transmission with hardened gears,12 gallon fuel tank (9 gallon was standard), a more comprehensive tool kit, metal lined brake shoes and a larger <b>tailshaft.</b> Six were produced at Holden's Melbourne's (Dandenong) plant and 120 in Sydney's (Pagewood) plant.|$|E

50|$|Mark Winterbottom set {{the fastest}} {{time in the}} final {{practice}} session, held on Saturday morning. Garth Tander was second-fastest, three tenths of a second behind Winterbottom, while Winterbottom's team-mate, Will Davison was third-fastest. Dick Johnson Racing's James Moffat finished the session in twenty-ninth, some thirty-six seconds off Winterbottom's time after his car broke a <b>tailshaft</b> that ripped an oil line free from underneath the car, causing enough damage to sideline the #17 entry {{for the remainder of}} the session.|$|E
50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} cars and trucks, the engine turns a {{driveshaft}} (also called a propellor shaft or <b>tailshaft)</b> which transmits rotational force to a drive axle {{at the rear}} of the vehicle. The drive axle may be a live axle, but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 9 is {{a popular}} choice for {{five-speed}} conversions of older cars and also for kit car builders, since {{it comes with a}} separate bell housing so it can be easily swapped around. Engines that were originally in FWD layouts are fitted to these transmissions so that they can go into a RWD layout, as in a hot rod engine swap or kit car. The gearbox has a 1 in 23-spline input shaft, and the main gear housing is cast iron with a cast aluminum <b>tailshaft</b> housing.|$|E
5000|$|Most shaft-drive systems {{consist of}} a drive shaft (also called a [...] "propeller shaft" [...] or Cardan shaft) {{extending}} from the transmission in front to the differential in the rear. The differentiating characteristic of the Hotchkiss drive {{is the fact that}} it uses universal joints at both ends of the driveshaft, which is not enclosed. The use of two universal joints, properly phased and with parallel alignment of the drive and driven shafts, allows the use of simple cross-type universals. In contrast, a torque tube arrangement uses only a single universal at the end of the transmission <b>tailshaft,</b> typically a constant velocity joint.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>tailshaft</b> {{housing is}} held onto the main case by four bolts (the bolt spacing {{is similar to}} the THM350), and uses a square-cut o-ring seal, and not a gasket. The typical width of this {{transmission}} where it bolts to the engine is 20 in overall. From the engine/trans mating surface to the cross member mount bolt is 22.5 in, and engine/trans surface to output shaft housing mating surface is 23.375 in overall, with the tail shaft housing typically measuring 7.625 in. External dimensions are similar to a THM350 with a 9 inch tailhousing found in Chevrolet/GMC long wheelbase truck/vans and 1971-76 B-bodies (Bel Air, Impala, Caprice).|$|E

50|$|The ship's {{total loss}} was {{reported}} by the Salvage Association's surveyor on 7 February 1957 who reported: Trawler Robert Limbrick, ashore Quinish Point, Mull: Survey shows vessel lying on port side, which not visible but damage to this side suspected extensive. Starboard side so far as visible severely damaged from forecastle to stem. Shell plating fractured from bulwark to keel and badly holed in way of fish hold also abreast of bridge. Deck fractured abreast of fish hold, stern frame broken, rudder missing, suspect propeller and <b>tailshaft</b> badly damaged. Engine-room and hull flooded and lifeboat badly stove in. Forward portion of vessel flexing with action of sea where fractured, not possible to board. Consider salvage impracticable. Further SW gales will accelerate vessel breaking up.|$|E
5000|$|In another well {{kept secret}} design move, the rocker panels of the Talladega were {{reshaped}} and rolled to allow Ford teams {{to run their}} racing cars about an inch closer to the ground while staying within NASCAR rules; this also greatly enhanced the top speed of the car by lowering its center of gravity, and further reducing its wind resistance. The cars were also equipped with an engine oil cooler, a power steering oil cooler, staggered shocks, a 3.25:1 Ford 9 inch 31 spline nodular open rear end, and most surprisingly: a heavy duty C-6 (cast iron <b>tailshaft)</b> automatic transmission that was column shifted. These other special performance parts were normally only available when ordering a [...] "drag pack car" [...] {{which would have been}} equipped with a 4 speed and a limited slip rear end.|$|E
5000|$|The 5.0-Litre [...] "Windsor" [...] {{engine was}} locally {{developed}} in TVE's workshop. It featured a significantly re-calibrated ECU, bigger SVO GT40 cylinder heads and new 42mm headers. As a result, it produced 200 kW's and 470 nm. TVE had considered using the 351ci {{version of the}} [...] "Windsor" [...] found in the EA series GT prototype, and a higher displacement version. Both projects were shelved due to the associated high costs. One of the unique features of this GT model was the special adaptive mode of its 4-speed automatic transmission developed by BTR. A computer monitored a number of inputs to select one of 5 different shift protocols, adapting to the driver's own style. To allow 30th Anniversary GT to be driven in excess of 180 km/h, a carbon-wrapped aluminium <b>tailshaft</b> was installed to eliminate the flex commonly found in standard Falcons. In July 1998, Wheels magazine reached {{a top speed of}} 232 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} was a 351 cu in (5.8 L) Windsor (351W) 2V motor with a 3 speed manual transmission, and a 9" [...] 28 spline open rear axle. A 351W 4V was optional as was a 390 cu in (6.4 L) FE, {{and the huge}} 428 cu in (7.0 L) Cobra Jet 4V with or without Ramair, and even {{the introduction of the}} [...] "drag pack" [...] option with the modified 428 cu in (7.0 L) Super Cobra Jet engine. A 4 speed manual or 3 speed FMX (small block)/C6 (big block) automatic transmission was optional, and the 428SCJ added a cast iron <b>tailshaft</b> in place of the regular aluminum one to the C6. A [...] "traction lok" [...] rear axle was optional, and the 428 CJ/SCJ included a [...] "traction lok" [...] with a 3.91 or 4.30 ratio, 31 spline axle shafts and a nodular case. In 1970, the 3.91 ratio was a [...] "traction-lok", while the 4.30 ratio was a Detroit Locker.|$|E

5000|$|The new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing {{more than}} 8 inches in overall length, {{measured}} {{about an inch}} narrower, and weighed nearly 500 lb less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of [...]32. The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 {{would be the most}} aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from {{the leading edge of the}} hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided [...] of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper. It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.The front end of the vehicle featured 10.5 in power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower front control arms. In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions <b>tailshaft</b> to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.|$|E
40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and <b>tailshaft</b> is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the <b>tailshaft</b> secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo predict {{and analyze}} {{accurately}} the lubrication characteristics and its influencing factors of marine sterntube bearings, coupling simulation between EHD and MBD for sterntube bearings of marine diesel engine propulsion system was carried out. FE models for crankshaft and main bearings of a two-stroke low-speed marine diesel engine, intermediate shaft, <b>tailshaft,</b> intermediate bearings and sterntube bearings {{of a chemical}} carrier were established, and the results files generated from reduced FE models by employing substructure methods were entered into MBD model. Sterntube bearing forces, load distribution, orbital path, minimum oil film thickness(MOFT) and total friction power loss on fore sterntube bearing and aft sterntube bearing in one working cycle under rated working conditions were investigated. Simulation {{results show that the}} sterntube bearings were safe enough for normal operation, the vertical load and the total friction power loss on aft sterntube bearing were significantly higher than that of fore sterntube bearing...|$|E
