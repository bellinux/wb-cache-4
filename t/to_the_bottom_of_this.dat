500|$|Twentieth-century scholarship's {{focus on}} the doubt {{expressed}} by Boniface regarding {{the authenticity of the}} Libellus has led to the widely held belief that a general atmosphere of suspicion surrounded the Libellus in the Middle Ages. In fact, Boniface appears to have been the only medieval personality to have ever expressed doubt about the authorship of this letter. As missionary to the Germanic peoples of Europe and legate of the papal see, Boniface spent much of his later life in Continental Europe, where he encountered many canonical traditions that were unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxons and that appeared to Boniface out of step with his knowledge of church tradition. The Libellus represented one such tradition. Boniface in fact had very practical reasons for questioning the Libellus. He had witnessed its recommendations being exploited by certain members of the Frankish nobility who claimed that the Libellus permitted them to enter into unions with their aunts, unions Boniface considered to be incestuous. Eager to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> controversy, in 735 Boniface wrote to Nothhelm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, requesting Nothhelm send him Canterbury's own copy of the Libellus; presumably Boniface hoped that Canterbury (being the one-time residence of Augustine) possessed an authentic copy of the Libellus, one that perhaps preserved more ancient readings than the copies then circulating in France and Bavaria, and would therefore serve as a corrective to the Continental copies and the incestuous nobles who relied upon them. Boniface also requested Nothhelm's opinion on the document's authenticity, for his own inquiries at the papal archives had failed to turn up an official [...] "registered" [...] copy of the letter there. His failed attempt to locate a [...] "registered" [...] papal copy of the Libellus presumably suggested to Boniface the possibility that the document was spurious and had in fact not been authored by Pope Gregory I.|$|E
2500|$|The violent {{events of}} the French Revolution {{impressed}} themselves deeply {{into the mind of}} Francis (as well as all other European monarchs), and he came to distrust radicalism in any form. [...] In 1794, a [...] "Jacobin" [...] conspiracy was discovered in the Austrian and Hungarian armies. [...] The leaders were put on trial, but the verdicts only skirted the perimeter of the conspiracy. [...] Francis's brother Alexander Leopold (at that time Palatine of Hungary) wrote to the Emperor admitting [...] "Although we have caught a lot of the culprits, we have not really got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> business yet." [...] Nonetheless, two officers heavily implicated in the conspiracy were hanged and gibbeted, while numerous others were sentenced to imprisonment (many of whom died from the conditions).|$|E
2500|$|On 10 May 2007, Lee officially {{declared}} {{his intention to}} seek the nomination of the Grand National Party (GNP) as its presidential candidate. On 20 August 2007, he defeated Park Geun-hye in the GNP's primary to become the party's nominee for the 2007 Presidential election. During the primary, Lee was accused of profiting from illegal speculation on land owned in Dogok-dong, an expensive neighborhood in Seoul. However, in August 2007, the prosecutors said in the interim announcement, [...] "We do suspect Lee's brother's claim over the land in Dogok-dong, but have failed to verify the real owner of the asset." [...] On 28 September 2007, the prosecutory authority officially dropped the suspicion that the Dogok land was under a borrowed name, announcing, [...] "We have done all necessary investigations, including tracing the proceeds {{from the sale of}} the land and call history, and now got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> case." [...] In December 2007, {{a few days before the}} presidential election, Lee announced that he would donate all of his assets to society.|$|E
