Not only no bodies; there were also no {{suitcases}} or large bags. I did not miss a single dive. I have quite a clear impression: The aircraft was filled with garbage, but there were really no people there. Why? Usually when an aircraft crashes, even a small one... As a rule there are suitcases and bags, or at least the handles of the suitcases." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by regular Burton collaborator Danny Elfman. Burton approached Pearl Jam during post-production to request an original {{song for the}} soundtrack and closing credits. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder wrote [...] "Man of the Hour", completing the demo by the next day. It was recorded by the band four days later. Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We were so blown away by the movie... Eddie and I were standing around talking about it afterwards and were teary-eyed. We were so emotionally charged and moved by the imagination and humanity <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> because of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> we should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E

500|$|For The Lion Kings {{first film}} trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening {{sequence}} {{with the song}} [...] "Circle of Life". Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said {{the decision was made}} for such an approach because [...] "we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> like it {{was probably one of the}} best four minutes of film that we've seen", and Don Hahn added that [...] "Circle of Life" [...] worked as a trailer as it [...] "came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters, as only a third of The Lion King had been completed. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview. Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 test screenings.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{backed the}} tenth austerity package which went before Parliament on 16 July. The package {{was the first}} in a series of prior actions necessary for negotiations to open up over bailout funding worth 86billion euros. The package came in two parts, with the first being approved on 16 July, and the second on 23 July. The legislation included a rise in VAT across several goods and services, the abolition of the VAT discount for Greek islands, a corporation tax rise from 26% to 29%, a luxury tax on cars, boats and swimming pools, an end to early retirement by 2022, and an increase in the retirement age to 67. Tsakalotos said on 16 July debate, [...] "I don't know if we did the right thing, however, I do know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> like we had no other choice but do what we did." [...] The contentious vote was opposed by 109 out of 201 members of the Central Committee of Syriza, and 32 Syriza MPs voted against the proposals on 16 July. It also led to a cabinet reshuffle on 17 July, but Tsakalotos retained his role as Minister of Finance.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{provides}} {{all of her}} character's vocals {{for both}} the film and its soundtrack. Because she does not consider herself a professional singer, Pfeiffer's inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting the role, having not done so since her performance in Grease 2; The Fabulous Baker Boys would mark Pfeiffer's first professional singing role in seven years. Despite Kloves' insistence that Pfeiffer's singing voice not be dubbed, composer Dave Grusin was initially skeptical about Pfeiffer's musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of [...] "My Funny Valentine". For four months (although sources differ, citing any period of time between two months to an entire year), the actress took extensive singing lessons {{under the tutelage of}} voice coach Sally Stevens in preparation for the role, at the suggestion of Grusin. In addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords, Pfeiffer would often work 10-hour days in the recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings. Already impressed with Pfeiffer's rhythm and phrasing, Stevens trained the actress to avoid pronouncing words in ways that would make the film's jazz standards sound too much like rock songs; Stevens jokenly linkened Pfeiffer's original pronunciation to musician Bob Dylan, and recording the songs for Pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation, teaching the actress about using her teeth and mouth to pronounce words and smiling to [...] "lift" [...] her pitch. Admitting that the film's songs were much more difficult than the ones she had performed in Grease 2, Pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because the material for The Fabulous Baker Boys were different than the pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing, explaining, [...] "Those older songs were written for singers; they weren't written for synthesizers and drums... It was an entirely new way of listening to songs." [...] Additionally, the actress drew inspiration from real-life lounge singers performing at The Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, while listening to jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday and Helen Merrill for inspiration, maintaining, [...] "I didn't copy anybody, but I heard a lot. For me, it helps to act the song out." [...] Pfeiffer incorporated the [...] "undercurrent of anger" [...] in the lounge singer's performances, drawn from the fact that [...] "a lot of club singers... haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for" [...] into her own interpretation of Susie. Stevens encouraged Pfeiffer to envision herself as Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in the film Casablanca (1942) while recording [...] "More Than You Know" [...] for the film's soundtrack, which the actress identified as one of her favorite songs. Stevens also suggested that Pfeiffer research jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald possesses [...] "a quality artists of that period had <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> the character Susie might have listened to", describing the end result as [...] "an airy alto, a nice breathy quality, and intelligence in delivery". Despite her extensive training, the vocal coach felt it was important that Susie's voice sound [...] "pleasant" [...] but still untrained. Kloves maintains that he did not hire Pfeiffer based on her singing abilities, but rather because {{of the way in which}} she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|An entire {{chapter of}} the book is devoted to {{perceived}} self-mockery within the series, with much attention given to the episode [...] "The L.A." [...] from Season One. Producer Allan Heinberg said that many instances of meta-commentary had to be cut if the network or Schwartz felt they had gone too far, saying that [...] "Sandy at one point had a speech about the Golden Globes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> was maybe a little inside." [...] Schwartz similarly declined a request to have The O.C. actors portray themselves on Arrested Development, another FOX show set in Orange County.|$|E

2500|$|Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) {{has used}} several {{different}} Gibson models {{over the course}} of his career including Goldtop Les Pauls, Flying Vs, Explorers, ES-5 Switchmasters and Les Paul Juniors. His main guitar is a 1959 Les Paul Standard nicknamed [...] "Pearly Gates". [...] "Pearly has such an unmistakable character <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> it was necessary to find another instrument with a similar sound to use as a spare guitar. We accumulated dozens of guitars, but nothing quite matched her. But instead of tossing these other acquisitions away, they kept accumulating. It's an ongoing saga that never ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was known}} for his essays, most {{particularly}} The Power of the Powerless, in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to [...] "live within a lie" [...] under the communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: [...] "...we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> we ought to do, and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover story}} of the January 15, 2015, issue, titled What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women proved controversial, due to both its illustration, {{described}} as [...] "the cartoon of a faceless female in spiky red heels, having her dress lifted up by a cursor arrow," [...] and its content, described as [...] "a 5,000-word article on the creepy, sexist culture of the tech industry." [...] Among those offended by the cover were Today Show co-host Tamron Hall, who commented [...] "I think it’s obscene and just despicable, honestly." [...] Newsweek editor in chief James Impoco explained [...] "We {{came up with an}} image <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> represented what that story said about Silicon Valley ... If people get angry, they should be angry." [...] The article's author, Nina Burleigh, asked, [...] "Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, guitarist/vocalist David Davidson, drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne and bassist Anthony Buda, who {{attended}} {{a high school in}} Boston, Massachusetts, formed Cryptic Warning, influenced by Guns N' Roses and Metallica. The band recorded its first demo in 2002 and gained an underground following in Boston, also performing outside of Massachusetts. A second demo, Internally Reviled, was recorded in 2004. In 2005, Cryptic Warning recorded its debut studio album, Sanity's Aberration, but was not content with the quality of the album's production. Remembering those recordings, Davidson said: [...] "We didn't record the album with a metal guy, so we didn't get the sound we wanted. The heaviest reference in our producer's discography was The Cult. A lot of people still love that record—our old-school fans who used to show up for all of the shows—but to us, we weren't really satisfied with the production of <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> {{it was one of the}} mistakes we made." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{commemorate the}} 20th anniversary of Achtung Babys {{original}} release, U2 reissued {{the record in}} several formats in October 2011. Leading up to the anniversary, the band was unsure how much attention to pay to a past album while still actively writing and recording new material. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "How big a deal do we make of an anniversary when we're {{in the middle of}} what we're doing now? We had a hard time figuring that out. We're not a heritage act. We're still very active. But this record was so pivotal <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> it was OK to revisit it." [...] Director Davis Guggenheim was subsequently commissioned by the band to make a film about Achtung Baby in six months. As a fan of U2 since his youth and having previously collaborated with The Edge for the 2008 documentary It Might Get Loud, Guggenheim agreed to the project. His goal for the film was to explain how U2 managed to remain together for so long, in contrast to other rock groups that have been undone by internal conflict; he described the band's longevity as [...] "fighting against that law of physics". Guggenheim also sought {{to tell the story of}} how the band transformed themselves musically over the course of Achtung Babys recording sessions.|$|E
