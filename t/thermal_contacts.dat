As two solild bodies of the same material approach one another, they transition from conditions of non-contact to homogeneous bulk type behaviour. The varying values of stiffness and true contact area that is exhibited at an interface during this transition is dependent on conditions of applied pressure and is of notable importance {{for the study of}} systems involving the physical interactions of multiple bodies including granular matter, electrode contacts, and <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts,</b> where the interface-localized structures govern overall system performance.|$|E

However, unlike all their predecessors, miniature tubes are not fitted with separate bases; the base {{is an integral part of}} the glass envelope. The pinched-off air evacuation nub is at the top of the tube, giving it its distinctive appearance. More than one functional section can be included in a single envelope; a dual triode configuration is particularly common. Seven- and nine-pin tubes were common, though miniature tubes with more pins, such as the Compactron series, were later introduced, and could fit up to three amplifying elements. Some miniature tube sockets had a skirt that mated with a cylindrical metal electrostatic shield that surrounded the tube, fitted with a spring to hold the tube in place if the equipment was subject to vibration. Sometimes the shield was also fitted with <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts</b> to transfer heat from the glass envelope to the shield and act as a heat sink, which was considered to improve tube life in higher power applications.|$|E

Experimental data was obtained over a pressure range of approximately 600 - 7000 kPa, in a vacuum environment. The experimental data was compared to the CMY plastic contact model, the Mikic elastic contact model and the SY elasto-plastic contact model to investigate the ability of such established <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> models to predict the <b>thermal</b> <b>contact</b> resistance at polymer interfaces. Based upon predictions made {{in regards to the}} mode of deformation of the asperities on the contacting surfaces the appropriate contact model showed good agreement with the experimental data for the stainless steel-stainless steel data set and the polycarbonate-stainless steel data sets.

These tests show that a conductively cooled window design using mechanical <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts</b> and sapphire is probably not practical. Cooling the window using mechanical <b>thermal</b> <b>contacts</b> produces thermal stresses in the sapphire that cause the window to crack. An insulated design using sapphire, that cools the window as little as possible, appears promising although some spectral data in the vacuum-ultra-violet (VUV) will be lost due to the high temperature reached by the sapphire. The surface of the insulated sapphire windows, tested at the 100 percent AFE heating rate, showed some slight ablation, and cracks appeared in two of three test windows. One small group of cracks were obviously caused by mechanical binding of the window in the assembly, which can be eliminated with improved design. Other cracks were long, straight, thin crystallographic cracks that have very little effect on the optical transmission of the window. Also, the windows did not fall apart along these crystallographic cracks when the windows were removed from their assemblies. Theoretical results from the thermal analysis computer program SINDA indicate that increasing the window thickness from 4 to 8 mm may enable surface ablation to be avoided.
