5|$|Success exposed TISM to {{mainstream}} Australian radio and television, {{most of which}} was perplexed by the band's guerrilla approach to interviews and {{lack of interest in}} the music industry. A four CD box set of early albums was released and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand. In 1996 TISM toured on <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Day</b> Out, during which Ron Hitler-Barassi was either absent or wheelchair-bound due to a detached retina and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel, Lorne, Victoria prior to the tour.
