5|$|Another kind of {{piezoelectric}} transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually into the resonator itself. This kind {{is good for}} <b>torsional</b> vibration modes and is called a <b>torsional</b> transducer.|$|E
5|$|The lateral and <b>torsional</b> {{stiffness}} {{of the rear}} frame and the wheel spindle affects wobble-mode damping substantially. Long wheelbase and trail and a flat steering-head angle {{have been found to}} increase weave-mode damping. Lateral distortion can be countered by locating the front fork <b>torsional</b> axis as low as possible.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in <b>torsional</b> resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, <b>torsional</b> mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 is {{the first}} Aston Martin model to be {{designed}} and developed on Ford's aluminium VH (vertical/horizontal) platform. The body structure is composed of aluminium and composites melded together by mechanically fixed self-piercing rivets and robotic assisted adhesive bonding techniques. The bonded aluminium structure is claimed to possess {{more than double the}} <b>torsional</b> rigidity of its predecessor's, despite being 25 percent lighter.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with <b>torsional</b> resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. <b>Torsional</b> forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Schott and Evans {{suggested}} that the regularity in squamosal ornamentation throughout the ontogeny of Stegoceras was consistent with species recognition, but the change from flat to domed frontoparietals in late age suggests that the function of this feature changed through ontogeny, and was perhaps sexually selected, possibly for intra-specific combat. In 2012, Caleb M. Brown and Anthony P. Russell {{suggested that}} the stiffened tails were probably not used as defence against flank-butting, but may have enabled the animals to take a tripodal stance during intra-specific combat, with the tail as support. Brown and Russell found that the tail could thereby help in resisting compressive, tensile, and <b>torsional</b> loading when the animal delivered or received blows with the dome.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} prototype metre and kilogram {{were both}} {{made from a}} 90%platinum, 10%iridium alloy which is exceptionally hard and which has good electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The prototype had a special X-shaped (Tresca) cross section to minimise the effects of <b>torsional</b> strain during length comparisons. and the prototype kilograms were cylindrical in shape. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms. At {{the first meeting of}} the CGPM in 1889 bar No.6 and cylinder No.X were accepted as the international prototypes. The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough <b>torsional</b> flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the <b>torsional</b> resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and <b>torsional</b> stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, for λL = π/2 + nπ, with {{arbitrary}} {{integer number}} n, tan(λL) is infinite. n = 0 {{corresponds to the}} point of <b>torsional</b> divergence. For given structural parameters, this will correspond to a single value of free-stream velocity U. This is the <b>torsional</b> diverengence speed. Note that for some special boundary conditions that may be implemented in a wind tunnel test of an airfoil (e.g., a <b>torsional</b> restraint positioned forward of the centre of lift) it is possible to eliminate the phenomenon of divergence altogether.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd {{failure of}} Samuel Langley's {{prototype}} plane on the Potomac has {{been attributed to}} aeroelastic effects (specifically, <b>torsional</b> divergence). Problems with <b>torsional</b> divergence plagued aircraft in the First World War, and were solved largely by trial-and-error and ad-hoc stiffening of the wing. In 1926, Hans Reissner published a theory of wing divergence, leading to much further theoretical research on the subject.|$|E
25|$|Cyclohexane has {{the lowest}} angle and <b>torsional</b> strain of all the cycloalkanes, as a result {{cyclohexane}} has been deemed a 0 in total ring strain.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} M7C was its fully enclosed monocoque which gave greater <b>torsional</b> rigidity than the bathtub chassis. It {{was based on}} McLaren's M10A Formula 5000 car, which itself {{was derived from the}} M7A. One was made.|$|E
25|$|At the {{junction}} of B- and Z-DNA, one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for <b>torsional</b> stress from RNA polymerase or nucleosome binding.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{dynamics}} {{was also}} an objective of the body design, so the body's frequencies for <b>torsional</b> twisting and bending are in separate ranges and above natural frequency. These frequencies {{are out of the}} range of engine and driveline vibrations, to avoid vibrations being amplified.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the sedan, the Alliance was now offered as a convertible for 1985 (AMC's first of this body type since the 1968 Rebel). The design was in collaboration with American Sunroof Company (now American Specialty Cars) that reinforced the Alliance's unibody for <b>torsional</b> rigidity during manufacture in Kenosha, Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Rotatory (<b>torsional)</b> nystagmus, {{where the}} top of the eye rotates towards the {{affected}} ear in a beating or twitching fashion, which has a latency and can be fatigued (the vertigo should lessen with deliberate repetition of the provoking maneuver). Nystagmus should only last for 30 seconds to one minute.|$|E
25|$|Panels for {{the body}} were {{produced}} using a new process called VARI (Vacuum Assisted Resin Injection). This method, which was patented by Lotus, offered advantages over the previous hand lay-up process. Kevlar reinforcement {{was added to the}} roof and sides for roll-over protection. This also increased the Esprit's <b>torsional</b> rigidity by 22%.|$|E
25|$|Control surface {{reversal}} is {{the loss}} (or reversal) of the expected response of a control surface, due to deformation of the main lifting surface. For simple models (e.g. single aileron on an Euler-Benouilli beam), control reversal speeds can be derived analytically as for <b>torsional</b> divergence. Control reversal {{can be used to}} aerodynamic advantage, and forms part of the Kaman servo-flap rotor design.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sporting}} uses {{have been}} for the material's actual qualities. Many ski makers have produced skis wholly from cloth and resin composite materials, using the tailorability of such construction to vary the stiffness, damping and <b>torsional</b> stiffness of a ski along its length. Hexcel, a manufacturer of aluminium honeycomb sheet, became well known for its branded skis, using this same advanced material.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocal space {{methods have}} been used {{extensively}} {{for their ability to}} evaluate enormous numbers of configurations. They lose their speed advantage if <b>torsional</b> changes are introduced. Another drawback is {{that it is impossible to}} make efficient use of prior knowledge. The question also remains whether convolutions are too limited a class of scoring function to identify the best complex reliably.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{strength}} of the chassis is improved {{with the addition of}} new tubular steel to the frame. The weight of the car increases, but the <b>torsional</b> stiffness is improved by somewhere between 25% and 100%. The added reinforcement was necessary in order for the CSR to support the heavy 2.3 litre Duratec engine. The CSR is also wider than previous models, which increases handling ability.|$|E
25|$|Straight or curved {{one-dimensional}} elements {{with physical}} properties such as axial, bending, and <b>torsional</b> stiffnesses. This type of element {{is suitable for}} modeling cables, braces, trusses, beams, stiffeners, grids and frames. Straight elements usually have two nodes, one at each end, while curved elements will need at least three nodes including the end-nodes. The elements are positioned at the centroidal axis of the actual members.|$|E
25|$|While no {{definitive}} biological significance of Z-DNA has been found, {{it is commonly}} believed to provide <b>torsional</b> strain relief (supercoiling) while DNA transcription occurs. The potential to form a Z-DNA structure also correlates with regions of active transcription. A comparison of regions with a high sequence-dependent, predicted propensity to form Z-DNA in human chromosome 22 with a selected set of known gene transcription sites suggests there is a correlation.|$|E
25|$|Bi-block (or twinblock) ties {{consist of}} two {{concrete}} rail supports {{joined by a}} steel bar. Advantages include increased lateral resistance and lower weight than monobloc concrete ties, as well as elimination of damage from <b>torsional</b> forces on the ties center due the more flexible steel connections. This tie type is in common use in France, and are used on the high-speed TGV lines. Bi-block ties are also used in ballastless track systems.|$|E
25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the <b>torsional</b> strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce <b>torsional</b> strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E
25|$|Porsche AG {{announced}} on May 7, 2007 that the 911 Turbo Cabriolet {{would go on}} sale in September 2007. The Porsche 997 Turbo Cabriolet {{became one of the}} fastest convertible sports cars in production. It is capable of similar top speeds and acceleration to the standard Porsche 997 turbo coupé, a notable feat due to the typical problems associated with convertible variants of hardtop coupés, such as the poor aerodynamics of a soft top, a lack of <b>torsional</b> rigidity, and the consequential weight increase from structural members.|$|E
25|$|Enveloping {{this rather}} {{conservative}} chassis was a low, curvaceous alloy-panel body, built in-house by Maserati. Maserati also built a streamlined {{version of the}} 4CL from the outset. Continued engine development, in response to Alfa Romeo's post-war introduction of two-stage supercharging, began to expose weaknesses in the chassis design. In an attempt to improve <b>torsional</b> rigidity Maserati began to experiment with tubular section chassis members. These experimental models ran alongside conventional 4CLs throughout the 1947 season, and {{eventually led to the}} introduction of the 4CLT in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Bristol's design, the Type 130, was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. Bristol's last monoplane design, the 1927 Bagshot, {{had suffered}} {{from lack of}} <b>torsional</b> rigidity in the wings leading to aileron reversal. This led to an extensive research program at Bristol {{which resulted in a}} wing design with a stressed metal skin rivetted to an internal framework consisting of multiple spars and the ribs. This was the basis of the Bombay's wing, which had seven spars, with high-tensile steel flanges and alclad webs. The aircraft had a twin-tail and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|Chassis {{and engine}} changes {{made to the}} {{experimental}} 4CLs eventually coalesced into the 4CLT, the appended T denoting its tubular chassis. The improvements in <b>torsional</b> rigidity that the tubular construction brought were required to counteract the increases in torque and power resulting from the twin-supercharger upgrade of the elderly inline-4 engine. Power was up to approximately , from the 4CL's 220. Other changes included the use of roller bearings for the crankshaft, forged (rather than cast) rear suspension components, and the chassis was designed to run with hydraulic dampers from the outset.|$|E
25|$|Pier 15 {{incorporated}} two seismic joints {{as part of}} its seismic retrofit, one {{separating the}} Bay Observatory from the Pier 15 shed and the other separating the entire pier from the land. This second joint ensures that the entire pier will move independently from the land mass {{in the event of an}} earthquake, significantly reducing the potential <b>torsional</b> stress. The café at the west end of the Exploratorium is named the Seismic Joint in honor of the joint, which cuts through the area of the building where the café is situated.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the <b>torsional</b> vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E
25|$|Designing {{a strong}} curved jib {{required}} Fairbairn's advanced theoretical {{understanding of the}} mechanics of a box girder. The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of back plates being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a compressive load. To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character of a box girder is to resist <b>torsional</b> twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling.|$|E
