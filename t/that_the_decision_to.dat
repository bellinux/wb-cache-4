5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the {{partisan}} leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E
5|$|A port to iOS devices {{done by the}} 2K China {{studio was}} {{released}} on August 27, 2014. The iOS version is content complete and functionally equivalent to the original Xbox 360 and Windows version, featuring either the use of touch-screen virtual gamepad controls {{or the use of}} a Bluetooth-enabled controller, and with a graphics engine optimized for iOS devices. The game was later delisted from the App Store in September 2015; the game had become unplayable for many that upgraded to iOS 8.4 on their devices, and while a patch had been discussed, a 2K representative stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> remove the game came from the developer. 2K later clarified that they will be working on resolving the issues with the game's compatibility with the new firmware and will re-release the title once that has been completed. However, by January 2017, 2K officially stated that it will no longer support the title, the game will remain on the App Store, but will not receive additional updates.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{expedition}} it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice. His insistence during {{the expedition}} on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown. Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were preserved; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition, and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10.|$|E
5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} {{in part because of the}} show's high production costs. He also concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
50|$|Colin Phillips, the AGU's {{executive}} director since 1978, retired {{from his position}} in 2005, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> merge had been forced upon the sport by the federal government, had been a factor in his decision.|$|R

5|$|On {{the basis}} of Vitozzi's {{declarations}} and the testimony of Giacomo Ascrittore, a regular police informer {{and member of the}} Camorra, the local police and judiciary of Naples identified Gaetano Amodeo and Tommaso De Angelis as the real killers. However, the murder investigation was transferred to the Carabinieri and delegated to Captain Carlo Fabbroni. Fabbroni accused the Naples police of inefficiency and corruption. The investigation got new momentum when Gennaro Abbatemaggio, a young camorrista and a former Carabinieri informer serving a jail sentence in Naples, testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> kill Cuocolo, suspected of being a police spy, had been taken at a meeting at the restaurant chaired by Alfano. The developments of the case and suspected police corruption were discussed in parliament several times.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{original}} title, Cheating Death: Final Destination 3, {{was changed}} during development. The companies that co-produced the franchise's first film—Craig Perry and Warren Zide's Zide/Perry Productions, and Wong and Morgan's own Hard Eight Pictures—returned to produce Final Destination 3. Practical Pictures and Manitee Pictures also {{helped with the}} film's production. The film was initially intended to be filmed in 3D, but plans for this were abandoned. Morgan revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> not film in 3D was mostly due to financial reasons, but also because he believed that fire and blood would not be shown properly in the red color filters of anaglyph 3D.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E
30|$|We perform {{two sets}} of tests. First, we {{estimate}} a multinomial logit to investigate the determinants of <b>the</b> banks’ <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> issue (or not to issue) {{the different types of}} available financial instruments (i.e., extensive margin). We examine both the sign and significance of the coefficient of each option (i.e., issuing debt, capital, or hybrid instruments) with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> of not issuing and the cross-differences between the different options. We consider this first approach to account for <b>the</b> possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> issue different types of securities is affected by the different theories. Second, we estimate a Tobit model to explore the determinants of the amount issued by banks in each type of financial instrument (i.e., intensive margin) and analyze whether they are different from <b>the</b> determinants <b>that</b> govern <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> issue each type of instrument.|$|R

5|$|While {{the first}} {{interview}} was videotaped, {{at the beginning of}} the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in {{the first interview}} are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> {{focus on}} Square Enix was made {{due to the}} large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and {{many of which were}} very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|Controversies {{regarding}} the siting of the Green Line continued. In May 1980, {{a group of}} business owners near the former proposed terminus at Branch Avenue and Auth Road near Marlow Heights sued Metro on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> {{change the course of}} the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro's rules). In February 1981, Judge Norman Park Ramsey of the U.S. District for Maryland held that Metro did not correctly advertise the hearings at which the change would be discussed. Metro appealed the ruling, and Judge Ramsey did not enjoin Metro from proceeding with construction until the appeal was resolved. The Prince George's County government, however, reaffirmed in April 1981 its support for the Rosecroft Raceway terminus, and Metro promised to hold a public hearing on the issue in June 1981. Shortly thereafter, the civil rights office in the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter to Metro warning that the Rosecroft Raceway route could negatively impact two historically black communities nearby. In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia to early 1988.|$|E
50|$|On 21 June 2016 the BBC apologised {{publicly}} to Richard {{for causing}} distress after the controversial broadcast. On 27 September 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> not <b>to</b> prosecute Richard over claims of historical sex offences had been upheld. The CPS reviewed the evidence following applications {{by two of}} his accusers, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> not <b>to</b> charge Richard was correct. It was later reported that Richard is suing the BBC and South Yorkshire Police. Legal papers were filed at the High Court in London on 6 October 2016.|$|R

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> treat a person with FH with statins should not {{be based on the}} usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely to underestimate the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time {{none of this was}} apparent to either side. Sokolov adds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original method to evaluate air traffic complexity metrics. Several complexity indicators, {{found in the}} litterature, were implemented and computed, using recorded radar data as input. A principal component analysis (PCA) provides some results on the correlations between these indicators. Neural networks are then used to find a relationship between complexity indicators and the actual sector configurations. Assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> group or split sectors are somewhat related to the controllers workload, this method allows to identify which types of complexity indicators are {{significantly related to the}} actual workload...|$|R

40|$|MBA thesis (WBS) Coal {{beneficiation}} {{is not a}} {{new concept}} and over the past few decades, numerous studies have been conducted on the subject. There is, however, little information available on <b>the</b> factors <b>that</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> beneficiate coal in South Africa. This research report aimed to identify <b>the</b> factors <b>that</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> beneficiate coal in South Africa. A qualitative methodology was used during the research process and the data was collected by means of face-to-face interviews with specialists from a specific mining house. The broad based research question led to open discussions that resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the issues and the identification of seven prominent factors <b>that</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> beneficiate coal. <b>The</b> key findings from this research study are that, in addition to the five factors identified in the literature review, there are two further noticeable factors influencing <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> beneficiate coal in South Africa which were not considered relevant three decades ago: these are environmental legislation and life extension of mines. The key message from this research study is that mining companies need to consider all seven factors when deciding whether or not to beneficiate coal in South Africa...|$|R
