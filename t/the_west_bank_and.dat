5|$|At 10:40, Gonen ordered Adan {{to cross}} to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> Sharon {{to move towards}} Suez City. Short of forces, Adan {{requested}} that Sharon send a battalion to protect his southern flank. Gonen consented, but Sharon would not comply, and consequently several critical positions would be lost to the Egyptians later on.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{is home to}} Bethlehem University, a Catholic Christian co-educational {{institution}} of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank,</b> <b>and</b> can trace its roots to 1893 when the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.|$|E

50|$|At {{its most}} limited {{geographical}} size, Rochester {{is defined as}} the market town within the city walls, now associated with the historic medieval city. However, Rochester historically also included the ancient wards of Strood Intra on <b>the</b> river's <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> Chatham Intra as well as the three old parishes on the Medway's east bank.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and two women, were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bethlehem {{hosted the}} largest {{economic}} conference {{to date in}} the Palestinian territories. It was initiated by Palestinian Prime Minister and former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad to convince {{more than a thousand}} businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the Middle East to invest in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories.|$|E
5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
25|$|Once {{over the}} Liane, 9th Brigade moved south along <b>the</b> river's <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Glengarries took the suburb of Outreau. The 9th Brigade was under heavy fire from a {{fortified}} position (code named Buttercup) {{on top of}} the peninsula between the river and the sea. Close coordination of the infantry advance and a creeping barrage enabled the strongpoint to be taken.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th {{century the}} {{territory}} of Lichte (Wallendorf) was located in two different principalities with the Lichte river forming the border. On <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> was Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt <b>and</b> on the east bank Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.|$|R

5|$|Tubas was {{transferred}} to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) control in 1995 under the Interim Agreement on <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip. During the Jordanian and Israeli periods, the city was under {{the administration of the}} Nablus Governorate, but in 1996, the PNA declared Tubas and the immediate area to be an electoral district, and later, an independent administrative area—the Tubas Governorate.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> East Jerusalem {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E
5|$|In December 2002, Fonda visited Israel and the West Bank {{as part of}} a tour {{focusing}} on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with Women in Black against Israel's occupation of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors, and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to Ramallah to see a physical rehabilitation center and Palestinian refugee camp. She was heckled by three members of Women in Green as she arrived to meet with leading Israeli feminists.|$|E
50|$|The Estero de Sunog Apog drains {{water from}} Manila {{as far north}} as Estero de Maypajo (also {{sometimes}} called Estero de Maypad), and then dumps water into Manila Bay via Estero de Vitas.

25|$|In 2005 Del Naja {{organised}} {{and performed}} at a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami Relief with Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow of Portishead. The two-night event featured Massive Attack, Portishead, Robert Plant, The Coral and Damon Albarn. Del Naja and Marshall performed three shows in 2005 {{in support of}} Hoping, an organisation that helps raise money, support projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza strip <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> Lebanon <b>and</b> Syria.|$|R
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} before the shooting, the Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip. The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, Sharon's {{division}} {{across the}} canal included the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade under Colonel Danny Matt and an armored brigade under Colonel Haim Erez. Sharon, wanting {{to expand the}} Israeli bridgehead northward, received permission to cross a third unit, an armored brigade under Colonel Amnon Reshef, to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> did so on October 19. The paratroopers {{and part of the}} armor had been holding the Israeli bridgehead since October 16, facing little resistance, while Reshef's brigade had been involved in heavy fighting at the Chinese Farm until it was relieved by Israeli reinforcements.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{this area}} on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> Phelps <b>and</b> Gorham gave 100 acre {{at the high}} falls of the Genesee River to Ebenezer [...] "Indian" [...] Allen, on the {{condition}} that he build the grist mill and sawmill. The grist mill was distant from potential customers—only about 25 families lived on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> at <b>the</b> time—and there were no roads going to it from the few nearby farms on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of <b>the</b> river. It never prospered. Allen's tract became the nucleus of modern Rochester, New York. The section of land on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> of <b>the</b> Genesee River became known as the Mill Yard Tract.|$|R
50|$|Hannibal took {{advantage}} of the pre-existing hatred the Celts had for the Romans on <b>the</b> right (<b>west)</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> persuaded them to aid him in his crossing of this formidable obstacle. He secured from them a number of boats that were capable of making trips at sea, and a numerous collection of canoes of all sorts that must have been employed by the natives of that country. In addition to purchasing these, he was able to acquire their aid in building still other boats. This process of preparing to cross the Rhone took two days.|$|R
50|$|Trent University routes {{connect the}} school with {{downtown}} and run at 10-minute headways daily during the Fall and Spring semesters, with reduced service during breaks and the Summer semester.

The service is directly {{paid for by}} the students through their tuition fees.|$|R
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|In the Pyramid Age, {{the tomb}} of the king was {{associated}} with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As {{the tomb of}} the king was hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
50|$|James Spalding from Perthshire, Scotland, and now of Frederica town on St. Simon's Island, {{operated}} two Indian trading {{stores on}} the St. Johns River, {{one on the}} east <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> another on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank.</b> He <b>and</b> his partner Roger Kelsall bought many of their goods through John Gordon in Charleston and merchant Basil Cowper in Savannah. Spalding and Kelsall, like many of their fellow traders, as well as Gordon and Cowper, were loyal to Great Britain. Panton, Leslie and Company, later the most well-known of the Creek trading firms, took over the Spalding and Kelsall stores when the two merchants emigrated to the Bahamas following the American Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|The Madison Street Bridge, or Madison Bridge, {{refers to}} two {{different}} bridges that spanned the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, from 1891 to 1900 and from 1900 to 1909. The bridges connected Madison Street, on <b>the</b> river's <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> Hawthorne Avenue, {{on the east}} bank, on approximately the same alignment as the existing Hawthorne Bridge. The original and later bridges are {{sometimes referred to as}} Madison Street Bridge No. 1 and Madison Street Bridge No. 2, respectively. [...] The second bridge, built in 1900, has alternatively been referred to as the [...] "rebuilt" [...] Madison Street Bridge (of 1891), rather than as a new bridge, because it was rebuilt on the same piers. Both were swing bridges, whereas their successor, the Hawthorne Bridge, is a vertical-lift-type.|$|R
50|$|The nīkau palm is {{the only}} palm species endemic to {{mainland}} New Zealand. Its natural range is coastal and lowland forest on the North Island, and on the South Island {{as far south as}} Okarito mostly in humidity (43°20′S) in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>and</b> <b>Banks</b> Peninsula (43°5′S) in the east. It also occurs on Chatham Island and Pitt Island/Rangiauria to the south-east of New Zealand, where it is the world's southernmost palm at 44° 18'S latitude.|$|R
5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets from both <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>and</b> Jordan before the Six-Day War, {{some of which}} caused Israel to retaliate which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.|$|E
5|$|The 20,000-man right (north) wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg {{stood on}} the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French {{bridgehead}} at Düsseldorf. A portion patrolled <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> behind the Nahe River. The Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress garrisons totaled about 10,000 more, including 2,600 at Ehrenbreitstein. Charles concentrated {{the bulk of his}} force, commanded by one of his more experienced generals, Count Baillet Latour, between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely; the rivers offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. A force occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank. Wilhelm von Wartensleben's autonomous corps covered the line between Mainz and Giessen.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{iron ore}} {{is high in}} {{phosphorus}} {{and needs to be}} mixed with purer ores, such as those on the west coast in Cumberland and Lancashire. In the early 1850s this ore was travelling the long way round over the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway to the Barrow-in-Furness area, and Durham coke was returning. Both the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway (SD) and the Eden Valley Railway (EVR) companies were formed on 20 September 1856. Taking advantage of the new railway at Barnard Castle, the SD crossed the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to meet the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Tebay, on the section then controlled by the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway, and also linked Barnard Castle with West Auckland. The EVR was a branch from Kirkby Stephen to the WCML near Penrith via Appleby. The routes were surveyed by Thomas Bouch and SD received permission on 13 July 1857. The EVR route followed the east bank of the River Eden, a mile longer than a more expensive route on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> its Act received royal assent on 21 May 1858.|$|E
50|$|Bergen, along <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> Hudson River <b>and</b> Bergen Hill {{would become}} {{contemporary}} Hudson County, New Jersey. Though it only became independent municipality from 1661 with {{the founding of}} a village at Bergen Square, Bergen began as a factorij at Communipaw circa 1615 and was first settled in 1630 as Pavonia, with settlements at Harsimus, Paulus Hook, Hoboken and Vriessendael were in the following years. They were {{along the banks of}} the North River (Hudson River) across from New Amsterdam, under whose jurisdiction they fell.|$|R
50|$|Colonel Roy E. Lindquist, {{commanding}} officer of the 508th PIR, was left in charge at Manoir de la Fière and led an assault at noon that eradicated the German defense, effecting a link up with an isolated group on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank.</b> Through miscommunication <b>and</b> poor assumptions, the lodgment was not consolidated and was overrun by a German counterattack an hour later. A counterattack by Company B of the 508th crossed the bridge but was broken up and the survivors forced to swim the river to safety.|$|R
50|$|The Kita-Kyushu Railway {{opened the}} Fukuyoshi to Hamasaki section in 1923, {{extending}} it west to Higashi-Karatsu (situated {{on the east}} bank of the Matsuura River, opposite the Karatsu Line on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>bank)</b> in 1924 <b>and</b> east to Hakata in 1924 and 1925. The line was again extended west to Yamamoto where it junctioned with the Karatsu line (establishing Higashi-Karatsu as a reversing station in the process) in 1929, and to Imari in 1935. Diesel locomotives were introduced in 1933, and the company was nationalised in 1937.|$|R
