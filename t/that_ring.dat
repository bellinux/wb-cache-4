5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes <b>that</b> <b>ring</b> the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E

25|$|One {{can think}} of MEMS {{resonators}} as small bells <b>that</b> <b>ring</b> at high frequencies. Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at high frequencies. Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are {{a tenth of a}} millimeter across and ring at tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz. MEMS resonators have operated at over a gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|Upon a papal death, {{the ring}} {{used to be}} ceremonially {{destroyed}} using a hammer {{in the presence of}} other Cardinals by the Camerlengo. This was done to prevent issuance of forged documents during the interregnum, or sede vacante. Today, the destruction of the ring's device with deep scratches is a symbol of the end of rule of the pope who used to wear <b>that</b> <b>ring.</b> This custom was followed after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI by applying two deep cuts, {{in the shape of a}} cross, on the signet with a chisel.|$|E

25|$|Bird ringing {{offers a}} unique {{opportunity}} for public education on both populations and individuals. Many organizations <b>that</b> <b>ring</b> birds offer demonstrations for the public where experts ring live birds while they highlight the steps of bird ringing, talk about why scientists ring birds, and answer questions from the public. Educating visitors about the process and benefits of bird ringing also helps to spread accurate information about the technique, such {{as the fact that}} the birds are released unharmed. While live bird ringing is not the only method of educating the public on bird conservation, it can be be an especially engaging and unique method for visitors.|$|E

His face is {{presented}} {{along with other}} ancient figures such as Solomon, the Greek god Zeus and the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. The Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in the oak courtroom doors, on the support frame of the courtroom's bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above the Chief Justice of the United States' head. In {{the center of the}} 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden.|$|E
25|$|At {{the corners}} of the plinth stand minarets: four large towers each more than 40metres tall. The towers are {{designed}} as working minarets, a traditional element of mosques, a place for a muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two balconies <b>that</b> <b>ring</b> the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chhatri that echoes the design of those on the tomb. The minaret chhatris share the same finishing touches: a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. Each of the minarets was constructed slightly out of plumb to the outside of the plinth, so that in the event of collapse (a typical occurrence with many such tall constructions of the period) the structure would fall away from the tomb.|$|E

25|$|This {{construction}} differs {{slightly from}} the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms n without mentioning the injective morphisms n: it constructs the homogeneous components of R separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the n. It is also observed that {{the result can be}} described as an inverse limit in the category of graded rings. That description however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a direct limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring RSd. It suffices to take for d the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree d of <b>that</b> <b>ring</b> is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by n for all n'd. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.|$|E

500|$|Each {{eruption}} {{is part of}} an eruptive {{cycle that}} climaxes with the partial collapse of the roof of the volcano's partially emptied magma chamber. [...] This creates a collapsed depression, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures <b>that</b> <b>ring</b> the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 800,000years, but the small number of such climactic eruptions cannot be used to make an accurate prediction for future volcanic events.|$|E

500|$|Ring {{had limited}} {{opportunities}} with the bat. Along with Toshack and Johnston, he invariably batted {{in the bottom}} three positions.N- This was because Australia's other frontline bowlers tended to be capable with the bat; Lindwall, Miller, and McCool all made Test centuries and more than nine triple-figure first-class scores, with the latter pair averaging over 30 in Tests. Johnson passed fifty on 21occasions in his first-class career, six of them in Tests. The strength of the batting side meant <b>that</b> <b>Ring</b> batted only 14times in his 19first-class matches on the tour, as Australia often batted only once and won by an innings, and several times declared [...] their first innings closed before Ring could bat. Ring scored 150runs at 16.66, an aggregate and average better than only Toshack's. He passed 50 only once, and his tour batting average was lower than his career benchmark of 23.25. Ring also took 12catches.|$|E
