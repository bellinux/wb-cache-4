5|$|In June 2007, vocalist Adam Lazzara said Taking Back Sunday were {{preparing}} to write the follow-up album to Louder Now (2006). In July, bassist Matthew Rubano mentioned that {{the other members of}} the band were in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> individually in separate locations: Rubano in Manhattan, Lazzara in Texas, guitarist Fred Mascherino in Jersey, drummer Mark O'Connell on Long Island and guitarist Eddie Reyes in Ohio. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour. During the tour, they brought along a mobile recording studio and demoed material, and continued writing for their next album. Plans to do serious writing, as well as record their next album towards the end of the year, were in place.|$|E

40|$|Creative Imitation is an {{alternative}} strategy to help students improve their expository writing in college composition. It combines writing by imitation with process modeling to increase student fluency with both <b>the</b> products and <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> For centuries, a technique of "imitatio" was used to teach oral and written language traditions. Isocrates, Quintilian, and Cicero shaped the tradition <b>of</b> imitating <b>writing</b> models. Their principles were revived in the 60 s by two neo-classical educators, Corbett and D'Angelo. Objections {{to the principles of}} imitation to teach writing are analyzed: models intimidate students, imitation focuses on the products instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> and imitation reduces individual creativity. Some teachers have reported success with student-centered writing-by-imitation exercises in college composition classrooms. They assert that imitation exercises increase student awareness of correct usage, grammar conventions, rhetorical strategies, and paradoxically enable students to develop an "authentic" voice in their own writing...|$|R
25|$|The {{origin of}} {{typographical}} ligatures {{comes from the}} invention <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> with a stylus on fibrous material (like paper) or clay. Businessmen especially who needed a way to speed up <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> communication found that conjoining letters and abbreviating words for lay use was more convenient for record keeping and transaction than the bulky long forms. The earliest known script, Sumerian cuneiform, includes many cases of character combinations that, over time, gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Ligatures figure prominently in many historical manuscripts, notably the Brahmic abugidas, or the bind rune of the Migration Period Germanic runic inscriptions.|$|R
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she was in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E
5|$|Renji {{also finds}} {{out that it is}} her dream to write a fantasy novel, but due to her {{condition}} has never been able to get far. Renji loves to read novels, and after discussing it with Chihiro, he collaborates with her to see if he can finally make her dream come true. Through <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> the novel, the two eventually become very close and they fall in love with each other. As the story progresses and more of the novel is written, Renji soon discovers that the novel is an allegory for Chihiro's life and how she sees the world around her due to the state of her limited memory.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} know about her and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E

5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings when he was in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's desires for the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling as tight as possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used the real-world location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{demonstrate}} that Erasmus, Calvin, and Milton view <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and attaining salvation as analogous and that how they define these processes {{is linked to}} their vision of nascent capitalism. While Erasmus and Calvin view the emerging capitalist economy with ambivalence, Milton, like seventeenth century political philosophers Hobbes and Locke, is wholly embedded in a capitalist economy and endorses what C. B. Macpherson has termed “possessive individualism. ” These three thinkers reflect the shift from a mixed economy to a purely capitalist one. Calvin and Erasmus imagine the sacred {{as the site of}} community whereas for Milton, the sacred is private. Erasmus founds his rhetorical system on his belief that human beings labor collectively for truth and salvation, and that the only real wealth is commonwealth. Consequently, his stylistic preferences tend toward expenditure. In contrast, Calvin sees salvation as a labor pure gift from God, found not in the public sphere, but in the private believer 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with God. Calvin values the rare, and consequently endorses stylistic frugality. In spite of privileging of the private, Calvin would impose the consequences of private truth upon an entire society. While Milton more closely approximates a Calvinist vision <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and salvation than an Erasmian one, labor re-enters <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and attaining salvation. Erasmus 2 ̆ 7 common labor, however, is replaced by the private labor of the solitary writer and the isolated believer. Only those who own the means of production have the authority to pursue writing and the development of theology. All others, who play no role in the public, must echo the master of the house. The public becomes the space out of which the private is shaped; each man forges a self and a theology from the public battleground. ...|$|R
40|$|Genres are {{embedded}} in professional or social practices, and hence they tend to call into the fore additional meanings {{as a result of}} their association with professional or disciplinary cultures. Therefore, in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> recontextualization <b>of</b> <b>written</b> discourse, whether in the same language, or in another language, it is important to maintain the generic integrity of the source text, so that one can convey not only the textual meaning, but also the more conventionalised generic meaning of the source text...|$|R

40|$|Writing journal {{articles}} {{is essential for}} academics and professionals to develop their ideas, make an impact in their fields and progress in their careers. Research assessment makes successful performance in this form <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> even more important. This article describes a course on writing {{journal articles}} and draws on interviews with participants {{one year after the}} course in which they identified persistent challenges. These writers’ accounts make visible some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> for publication that are often tacit and identify key writing strategies. However, they also identify barriers to writing in academic workplaces and those professional workplaces where academic writing is produced. This article concludes by suggesting that while research assessment values written outputs over almost everything else, it is equally important to legitimise writing processes—and to be able to articulate the development of these processes—in communities of research practice...|$|R
