The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports {{took the lead}} in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts. During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, <b>teaching</b> <b>curriculum,</b> and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level. The suppression of traditional teaching was relaxed during the Era of Reconstruction (1976–1989), as Communist ideology became more accommodating to alternative viewpoints. In 1979, the State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports created a special task force to reevaluate the teaching and practice of Wushu.|$|E
25|$|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, 400 F. Supp. 2d 707 (W.D. Pa. 2005) was {{the first}} direct {{challenge}} brought in the United States federal courts testing a public school district policy that required the teaching of intelligent design. In October 2004, the Dover Area School District of York County, Pennsylvania, changed its biology <b>teaching</b> <b>curriculum</b> to require that intelligent design be presented {{as an alternative to}} evolution theory, and that Of Pandas and People, a textbook advocating intelligent design, was {{to be used as a}} reference book. The prominence of this textbook during the trial was such that the case is sometimes referred to as the Dover Panda Trial, a name which recalls the popular name of the Scopes Monkey Trial in Tennessee, 80 years earlier. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judge's decision sparked considerable response from both supporters and critics.|$|E

2500|$|... {{was not an}} {{immediate}} bestseller, but its popularity grew with each edition. The early editions attracted lukewarm critical reviews, generally {{on the basis that}} the stories were unappealing to children. The brothers responded with modifications and rewrites in order to increase the book's market appeal to that demographic. By the 1870s, the tales had increased greatly in popularity, {{to the point that they}} were added to the <b>teaching</b> <b>curriculum</b> in Prussia. In the 20th century, the work has maintained status as second only to the Bible as the most popular book in Germany. Its sales generated a mini-industry of criticism which analyzed the tales' folkloric content in the context of literary history, socialism, and psychological elements often along Freudian and Jungian lines.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} aim of undertaking {{the study was}} to develop a <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum</b> for teachers colleges in Zimbabwe. In order to accomplish this, basic questions on curriculum development were first investigated These were on curriculum intent, structure and content. In chapter two a conceptual framework for the proposed <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum</b> was investigated. This involved an analysis of the influence of aims of education on curriculum theory and development, issues of curriculum foundations and models of curriculum development. The analysis culminated in the adoption of a cyclical model {{for the development of the}} proposed <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum.</b> The cognitive framework of the study was further illuminated through the conceptualisation of the <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum,</b> where philosophical foundations of teaching practice as well as its theoretical contexts were examined. Critical in this was the theory-practice relationship. In chapter four, the prevailing teaching practice situation in Zimbabwe was examined and views of lecturers and students on it analysed. This was accomplished in order to further identify flaws in the current approach to teaching practice which could be improved by means of the proposed <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum.</b> The <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum</b> being proposed was synthesised and developed in chapter five. This curriculum is founded on the philosophical foundations discussed in chapters two and three. It has theoretical components and is implemented in teachers' colleges and schools. It brings to the fore the importance of partnership between the practising schools and colleges as well as reflective teacher education. The development of the proposed <b>teaching</b> practice <b>curriculum</b> resulted in the following outcomes: • An investigation into how theory and practice in teacher education could be integrated. • Suggestions for improving the college-school relationship through the development of partnership in teacher education. • The extrication of theory p-orn practice. • An emphasis on the importance of reflective practice and reflective teacher education. In recommending the adoption and implementation of the curriculum the researcher identified a number of meaningful consequences: • The improvement of teaching practice programmes in colleges. • The development of expertise in the practice of education. • The active involvement of experienced teachers in teacher education and training. • The resurgence of research in the practical aspect of teacher education.
