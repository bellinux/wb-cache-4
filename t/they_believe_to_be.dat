5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that they mean it no harm; and the fear emanations cease.

They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E
