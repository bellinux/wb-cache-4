The expressway redevelopment included asphalting the Santo Tomas - Lipa segment, upgrading the Lipa - Batangas City segment to a four-lane divided expressway, improvements on the <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system, <b>installation</b> of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras for traffic monitoring, and addition of lighting on some segments. [...] The expansion of the Lipa-Batangas City segment commenced on June 2013, and finished in June 2015 with adding of lights.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Toll</b> <b>collection</b> {{can have}} an open or closed system. In an open system, the users pay the toll in either {{entrance}} or exit gate, while in a closed system, they take a ticket in the entrance gate and pay the toll in the exit gate. The structure of open and closed <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> systems can be simulated to get optimum locations that would generate the highest revenue. Secondary data from the Tollway Authority was used to construct an OD matrix. Elasticity of demand by changing the price was used to model the reduced demand due to change in structure of the <b>toll</b> <b>collection.</b> Several scenarios of structure changes were proposed, simulated and evaluated. Evaluation concludes that two open systems were the best scenarios for the tollway and improvement in the <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> of about 8 % compared with the existing condition. 1. BACKGROUND The collection system in a tollway can be an open or closed system. In the open <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system, the road user usually pays in entrance gate or exit gate, while in the closed <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> system, the road user takes the ticket in the entrance gate and pays the toll in the exit gate.

40|$|The <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> process creates {{pollution}} {{beyond what}} would be produced by an automobile transiting at normal highway speeds. Research shows that electronic <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> (ETC) produces less pollution than manual <b>toll</b> <b>collection.</b> However, many <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> systems are subject to seasonal fluctuations in demand. As a result, the percentage of road users taking advantage of ETC changes throughout the year. Any decrease in the ETC participation rate will {{increase the amount of}} pollution created. This article quantifies the pollution effects of this seasonality. The authors use the Garden State Parkway (GSP) in New Jersey as a case study. Because of seasonal changes in ETC participation rates, they find that the quantity of pollution created by <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> on the GSP increases significantly during the summer months.

50|$|The most {{controversial}} {{development of the}} FT1 highway in Kuala Lumpur was the <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> at Jalan Kuching FT1. The nine-year concession of Jalan Kuching FT1 was awarded to Kamunting Corporation Berhad, signed on 15 April 1985. In the original concessionaire agreement, Kamunting Corporation Berhad was required to build an interchange at Kepong Roundabout and to upgrade the Jalan Kepong FT54, {{in return for the}} nine-year <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> rights starting from 1987 until 1996. However, in 1987, the concessionaire agreement was amended, and Kamunting Corporation Berhad was required to add two more lanes from the existing four lanes along Jalan Kuching FT1, resulting another 7-year extension of toll concession which was ended in 2003. The <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> at Jalan Kuching FT1 had sparked fury among Kuala Lumpurian motorists, and numerous protests were held to urge the government to end the <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> there. The <b>toll</b> <b>collection</b> at Jalan Kuching FT1 was finally abolished on 8 January 2003.|$|R
