50|$|Exon {{junction}} complexes play a {{major role}} in mRNA surveillance. More specifically, they are found in the nonsense mediated decay pathway (NMD), wherein mRNA transcripts with premature stop codons are degraded. In normal mRNA translation, the ribosome binds to the transcript and begins amino acid chain elongation. It continues on until it reaches the location of the exon junction complex, which it then displaces. Next, translation is complete when the ribosome reaches a <b>termination</b> <b>codon.</b> In NMD, the mRNA transcript contains a premature <b>termination</b> <b>codon</b> (PTC) due to a nonsense mutation. If this codon occurs prior to the EJC site, the EJC will remain bound, triggering mRNA decay. The EJC and its position serve as a type of regulator, determining whether the transcript is defective or not.|$|E

But a surprisingly low number of readthrough polypeptides were observed from the 500 mRNAs studied in comparison to uninjected oocytes. The experimental data are compared with the conclusions obtained from the compilation of all available termination sequences on eukaryotic and prokaryotic mRNAs. This comparison indicates that the apparent resistance of natural <b>termination</b> <b>codons</b> against readthrough, as observed by the microinjection experiments, cannot be explained by tandem or very close second stop codons.

40|$|Although it is {{frequently}} assumed that translation {{does not occur}} in eukaryotic nuclei, recent evidence suggests that some translation can take place {{and that it is}} closely coupled to transcription. The first evidence concerns the destruction of nuclear mRNAs containing premature <b>termination</b> <b>codons</b> by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Only ribosomes can detect <b>termination</b> <b>codons,</b> and as some NMD occurs within the nuclear fraction, active nuclear ribosomes could perform the required detection. The second evidence is the demonstration that tagged amino acids are incorporated into nascent polypeptides in a nuclear process coupled to transcription. The third evidence is that components involved in translation, NMD and transcription colocalize, coimmunoprecipitate and co-purify. All these results are simply explained if nuclear ribosomes scan nascent transcripts for premature <b>termination</b> <b>codons</b> at the site of transcription. Alternatively, the scanning needed for NMD might take place at the nuclear membrane, and contaminating cytoplasmic ribosomes might give the appearance of some nuclear translation.

40|$|A simple {{quantitative}} {{in vivo assay}} {{has been}} developed for measuring the efficiency of translation of one or other of the three <b>termination</b> <b>codons,</b> UAA, UAG and UGA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The assay employs a 3 -phosphoglycerate kinase-beta-galactosidase gene fusion, carried on a multicopy plasmid, in which the otherwise retained reading frame is disrupted by one or other of the three <b>termination</b> <b>codons.</b> <b>Termination</b> readthrough is thus quantitated by measuring beta-galactosidase in transformed strains. Using these plasmids to quantitate the endogenous levels of termination readthrough we show that readthrough of all three codons can be detected in a non-suppressor (sup+) strain of S. cerevisiae. The efficiency of this endogenous readthrough is much higher in a [psi+] strain than in a [psi-] strain with the UGA codon being the leakiest in the nucleotide context used.

We show that amber, ochre and opal suppressor tRNAs, derived from Escherichia coli glutamine tRNA, suppress UAG, UAA and UGA <b>termination</b> <b>codons,</b> respectively, in a reporter mRNA in mammalian cells. Activity of each suppressor tRNA is dependent upon the expression of E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, indicating that none of the suppressor tRNAs are aminoacylated by any of the twenty aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the mammalian cytoplasm. Amber, ochre and opal suppressor tRNAs {{with a wide range of}} activities in suppression (increases of up to 36, 156 and 200 -fold, respectively) have been generated by introducing further mutations into the suppressor tRNA genes.

5000|$|In 1973 Dalgarno and Shine {{proposed}} that in eukaryotes, the 3'-end {{of the small}} 18S rRNA {{may play a role}} in the termination of protein synthesis by complementary base pairing with <b>termination</b> <b>codons.</b> This came from their observation that the 3' terminal sequences of 18S rRNA from Drosophila melanogaster , Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rabbit cells are identical: GAUCAUUA -3'OH. [...] The conservation of this sequence between such distantly related eukaryotes implied that this nucleotide tract played an important role in the cell. Since this conserved sequence contained the complement of each of the three eukaryotic <b>termination</b> <b>codons</b> (UAA, UAG and UGA) it was proposed to have a role in the termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. A similar role for the 3' end of 16S rRNA in recognising termination triplets in E.coli was proposed in 1974 by Shine and Dalgarno on the basis of complementarity relationships between the 3'-terminal UUA-OH in 16S rRNA and E.coli <b>termination</b> <b>codons.</b> In F1 phage, a class of viruses that infect bacteria, the sequence coding for the first few amino acids often contains termination triplets in the two unused reading frames.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{detecting}} aberrant transcripts occurs during {{translation of the}} mRNA. A popular model {{for the detection of}} aberrant transcripts in mammals suggests that during the first round of translation, the ribosome removes the exon-exon junction complexes bound to the mRNA after splicing occurs. If after this first round of translation, any of these proteins remain bound to the mRNA, NMD is activated. Exon-exon junction complexes located downstream of a stop codon are not removed from the transcript because the ribosome is released before reaching them. Termination of translation leads to the assembly of a complex composed of UPF1, SMG1 and the release factors, eRF1 and eRF3, on the mRNA. If an EJC is left on the mRNA because the transcript contains a premature stop codon, then UPF1 comes into contact with UPF2 and UPF3, triggering the phosphorylation of UPF1. In vertebrates, the location of the last exon-junction complex relative to the <b>termination</b> <b>codon</b> usually determines whether the transcript will be subjected to NMD or not. If the <b>termination</b> <b>codon</b> is downstream of or within about 50 nucleotides of the final exon-junction complex then the transcript is translated normally. However, if the <b>termination</b> <b>codon</b> is further than about 50 nucleotides upstream of any exon-junction complexes, then the transcript is down regulated by NMD. The phosphorylated UPF1 then interacts with SMG-5, SMG-6 and SMG-7, which promote the dephosphorylation of UPF1. SMG-7 is thought to be the terminating effector in NMD, as it accumulates in P-bodies, which are cytoplasmic sites for mRNA decay. In both yeast and human cells, the major pathway for mRNA decay is initiated by the removal of the 5’ cap followed by degradation by XRN1, an exoribonuclease enzyme. The other pathway by which mRNA is degraded is by deadenylation from 3’-5'.|$|E

The clotting system requires precise regulation and coordinated reactions to maintain {{the integrity of the}} vasculature. Clotting insufficiency mostly occurs due to genetically inherited coagulation factor deficiencies such as hemophilia. Materials and Methods: A relevant literature search of PubMed was performed using the keywords coagulation factors, Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and premature translation <b>termination</b> <b>codons.</b> Search limitations included English language and human-based studies. Results: Mutations that cause premature translation <b>termination</b> <b>codons</b> probably account for one-third of genetically inherited diseases. Transcripts bearing aberrant <b>termination</b> <b>codons</b> are selectively identified and eliminated by an evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional pathway known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

Since the F 8 gene is located on the X-chromosome, a connection between X-linked traits and mRNA decay could be assumed.
