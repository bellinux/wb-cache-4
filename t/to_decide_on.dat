5|$|When James Cameron {{agreed to}} make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his {{previous}} Terminator 2 contract as a template. A clause in this agreement gave Cameron the right <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> movie and advertising credits. Show business trade articles and advertisements {{made no mention of}} Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film. In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer. On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> credits. Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued. 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron’s participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract. In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 1985 and 1987 {{agreements}} with the Parliament of Norway ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics bid, Lillehammer Municipality was responsible for financing and building all Olympic venues and associated facilities. To fulfill their obligation, the municipality established Lillehammer Olympiske Anlegg (LOA) in 1989. Mr. Haavind was hired as the company's first managing director. At {{the same time the}} Post-Olympics Use Committee was established to ensure activity at the venues after the Olympics.

5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E

5|$|According to Baley, {{political}} and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was {{the enactment of the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> the legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.|$|E

Leaving them under the care of Dr. Becker, von Hentig proceeded towards Tehran <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> the subsequent plans with Prince Heinrich Reuss and Niedermayer.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E

Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial.

5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} their forces, but left {{a third of their}} forces behind.

Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of berserkergang, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword.|$|E

When the 1988 Matignon agreements were signed between the representatives of France and New Caledonia <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> holding the referendum for independence, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the Kanak leader of the independence movement, had mooted a proposal {{to set up an}} Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture (ADCK).

The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre was formally established in May 1998.|$|E

Enticed by Julia's bribes, the legion proclaimed Elagabalus the righful Emperor of Rome on 16 May 218.

Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and {{his understanding of the}} former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
