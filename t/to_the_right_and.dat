5|$|Just {{under five}} {{seconds after the}} {{undercarriage}} left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the stick shaker activated.

This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
