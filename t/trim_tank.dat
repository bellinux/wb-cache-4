50|$|The Type 93 torpedo {{formed the}} {{majority}} of this model of Kaiten with the only alterations being the warhead yield being increased from 490 kg and the control planes enlarged and altered to allow both gyroscope and pilot control. Between the torpedo warhead and the engine section is the torpedo compressed air flask, 6 (or 8 in later models) steering air bottles and the forward <b>trim</b> <b>tank,</b> followed by the control area and the pilot's seat. In later models the 5.5 L Tetrachloromethane starting air bottle {{is located in the}} cockpit and a further smaller trimming tank is supplied for use at initial launch. The engine section is slotted in above the aft <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> with the joint protected by a sheet metal cowl.|$|E
50|$|Behind the {{peroxide}} chamber is the pilot's compartment. This is {{much more}} complex with more controls {{than that of the}} Type 1. From fore to aft controls available to the pilot are: depth control gear, <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> controls, electric switches, gyroscope, rudder control, engine control lever, gauges for various applications, warhead safety gear, engine starter, fuel flow control, and lights with their respective switches.|$|E
50|$|On 28 April 1942, Saury cleared Fremantle for {{her third}} war patrol, but, three days later, {{a crack in}} the after <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> caused her to return to Australia. On 7 May, she again {{departed}} Fremantle and headed north. By 14 May, she was off Timor; and, by 16 May, she was in the Flores Sea, en route to the Banda Sea and the eastern Sulawesi (Celebes) coast. On 18 May, off Wowoni, she fired three torpedoes at an enemy cargo-passenger ship without effect. She remained in the area for two days to intercept enemy traffic to Kendari; then moved north to hunt in Greyhound Strait and the Molucca Passage. On 23 and 24 May, she was off Kema, whence she rounded North Cape to patrol off Manado on the tip of northern Sulawesi.|$|E
50|$|Abaft {{the fuel}} tank and ballast tank is the in-line six diesel engine, {{followed}} by the aft <b>trim</b> <b>tanks,</b> gearbox and reduction motors and finally the electric motor and propellers.|$|R
50|$|Submarines in {{a neutral}} {{buoyancy}} condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired trim, submarines use forward and aft <b>trim</b> <b>tanks.</b> Pumps can move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pointing the sub up or down. A similar system is sometimes used to maintain stability.|$|R
50|$|The forward end of {{the forward}} section {{contains}} the air vessels, there are four in this section, one Type 93 torpedo air vessel flanked either side by 2 small <b>trim</b> <b>tanks</b> on the keel and three smaller vessels directly above it. The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing. The smaller air vessels are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect. They are sealed by {{the pressure of the}} gas, as the pressure rises, a slackly threaded cap presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap, thus making an airtight seal. Directly aft of the air vessels is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward <b>trim</b> <b>tanks.</b> The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing. Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles.|$|R
50|$|The A300-600ST Beluga shares many design similarities, {{although}} substantially differing in appearance, to the Airbus A300 it {{was based}} upon. The wings, engines, landing gear, and {{the lower part of}} the fuselage remain identical to those used on the conventional A300, while the upper part of the fuselage forms an enormous horseshoe-shaped structure 7.7 m in diameter. In comparison with the Super Guppy, the payload was more than doubled and the volume increased by more than 30 per cent. The General Electric CF6-80C2 turbofan engines used are slightly uprated from those used on the standard A300 as well. The vertical stabilizer uses a modified Airbus A340 fin with a 1.12 m base extension while the tailplane was strengthened and fitted with auxiliary fins to maintain directional stability. The tailplane <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> was also deleted.|$|E
50|$|Twelve days later, she {{departed}} on {{her fourth}} war patrol. Moving westward, she hunted in the Japanese traffic lanes between Kiska and Attu {{during the first}} week of the patrol. On 28 July, leaks developed in the after <b>trim</b> <b>tank,</b> but were compensated for by placing nine tons of water in the forward trim tanks. Although this meant that space was left to accommodate water for only one torpedo reload, depth control was regained, and with fuel suction shifted forward, reload capability slowly improved. On 29 August, she was off Amchitka to check for enemy shipping in sheltered areas on that island's north coast; then, on 31 August, she headed east to cover the Allied occupation of Adak. On 14 September, she returned to the junction of Rat Island and Amchitka where she continued her patrol for another six days. On 20 September, she headed for Dutch Harbor.|$|E
50|$|Kaiten {{pilots were}} all men aged between 17 and 28. Initial {{training}} consisted of sailing fast surface boats by periscope and instrument readings alone. When a pilot had advanced past this basic training, he would begin training on Kaitens. Training craft were {{fitted with a}} dummy warhead that contained telemetry equipment and an emergency blowing tank that could return the craft to the surface should the trainee dive to a dangerous depth. Kaiten training started with basic circular runs to and from a fixed landmark at a reduced speed; the training advanced to faster and more hazardous runs around rocks and through channels in deeper waters. The more difficult runs required the pilot to surface and check the periscope repeatedly and also required conscientious adjusting of <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> levels because of the reducing weight as oxygen was used up. When the instructors were confident of the pilot's abilities, he would be advanced to training in open waters against target ships. Training at this level was often done at full attack speed and at night or in twilight. The final phase of training would be a submarine launch and more open water attack runs on target ships.|$|E
50|$|When U-371 first {{attempted}} to surface after crippling the Menges, depth charges forced her back down, while putting {{out all the}} lights, damaging the hydroplanes, and rupturing the <b>trim</b> <b>tanks.</b> The U-boat levelled off at about 200 - 215 m, leaking badly. The depth charge attacks continued at about 30-minute intervals, with increasing accuracy, and the U-boat sustained further damage.|$|R

50|$|Holland VI {{included}} many features that submarines {{of the early}} 20th century would exhibit, albeit in later, more advanced forms. There was a conning tower from which the boat and her weapons could be directed.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{concerns a}} ship whereby the hull and the mechanical propulsion device are designed {{such that the}} Froude number is larger than 0. 5. In the aft ship the hull has a bottom with V-shaped bottom surfaces with a deadrise angle that is less than 40 degrees and the hull has substantially vertical sides. In the hull are a passenger compartment and a <b>trim</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> volume is such that {{the weight of a}} filled <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> is more than 30 % of the weight of displacement of the hull with an empty <b>trim</b> <b>tank,</b> filling the <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> with water increases the amidships immersed width with at least 10 %, and the bottom surfaces (15) have bilge keels (13, 26) fully immersed when the <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> is filled with water and the bilge keels are at least in part above the water level when the <b>trim</b> <b>tank</b> is empty.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) /Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) Life Extension Project, a next {{generation}} solvent (NG-CSSX), a new strip acid, and modified monosodium titanate (mMST) will be deployed. The strip acid will be changed from dilute nitric acid to dilute boric acid (0. 01 M). Because of these changes, experimental testing with the {{next generation}} solvent and mMST is required to determine the impact of these changes in 512 -S operations as well as Chemical Process Cell (CPC), Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) glass formulation activities, and melter operations at DWPF. To support programmatic objectives, the downstream impacts of the boric acid strip effluent (SE) to the glass formulation activities and melter operations are considered in this study. More specifically, the impacts of boric acid additions to the projected SB 7 b operating windows, potential impacts to frit production temperatures, and the potential impact of boron volatility are evaluated. Although various boric acid molarities have been reported and discussed, the baseline flowsheet used to support this assessment was 0. 01 M boric acid. The results of the paper study assessment indicate that Frit 418 and Frit 418 - 7 D are robust to the implementation of the 0. 01 M boric acid SE into the SB 7 b flowsheet (sludge-only or ARP-added). More specifically, the projected operating windows for the nominal SB 7 b projections remain essentially constant (i. e., 25 - 43 or 25 - 44 % waste loading (WL)) regardless of the flowsheet options (sludge-only, ARP added, and/or the presence of the new SE). These results indicate that even if SE is not transferred to the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT), there would be no need to add boric acid (from a <b>trim</b> <b>tank)</b> to compositionally compensate for the absence of the boric acid SE in either a sludge-only or ARP-added SB 7 b flowsheet. With respect to boron volatility, the Measurement Acceptability Region (MAR) assessments also suggest that Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) acceptability decisions would not be different assuming either 100 % of the B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } from the SE were retained or volatilized. More specifically, the 0. 84 wt% B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } in the SE is so minor that its presence in the SME analysis does not influence SME acceptability decisions. In fact, using the 100 % retention and 100 % volatilization composition projections, only minor differences in the predicted properties of the glass product occur with all of the glasses being acceptable over a WL interval of 32 - 42 %. Based on the 0. 01 M boric acid flowsheet, there is very little difference between Frit 418 and Frit 418 - 7 D (a frit that was compositionally altered to account for the 0. 84 wt% B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } in the SE) with respect to melt temperature. In fact, when one evaluates the composition of Frit 418 - 7 D, it lies within the current Frit 418 vendor specifications and therefore could have been produced by the vendor targeting the nominal composition of Frit 418...|$|E

50|$|The {{hydrostatic}} {{effect of}} variable ballast tanks {{is not the}} only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several surfaces, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves at sufficient speed. The stern planes, located near the propeller and normally horizontal, serve the same purpose as the <b>trim</b> <b>tanks,</b> controlling the <b>trim,</b> and are commonly used, while other control surfaces may not be present on all submarines. The fairwater planes on the sail and/or bow planes on the main body, both also horizontal, are closer to the center of gravity, and are used to control depth with less effect on the trim.|$|R
50|$|The {{boat had}} two {{centrally}} placed ballast <b>tanks</b> and <b>trimming</b> <b>tanks</b> at either end. Electric pumps {{were used to}} redistribute the water. There was a detachable central lead keel. The ship was initially fitted with manually operated diving rudder at the stern as {{in the design of}} , butproved difficult to maintain level or on a steady incline while diving or rising. Hydraulic hydroplanes were therefore added {{at the center of the}} ship and forwards. The ship was designed to dive to a depth of 50 ft. A periscope was fitted in the conning tower which gave a field of view 20° above and 7° below the horizon but the view was distorted and of limited use.|$|R
50|$|The {{submarine}} {{was designed}} by Ingenieur Kontor Lübeck (IKL) headed by Ulrich Gabler and is largely based on previous German submarine designs (in particular the Type 206) with increased equipment. The design is single hulled and allows the commanding officer to see the entire submarine from the bow to stern while standing at the periscope. Four 120-cell batteries are located forward and aft of the command center in the lower deck and make up about 25% of the boat's displacement. Two main ballast tanks with forward and aft <b>trim</b> <b>tanks</b> allow the boat to dive. They are powered by four MTU diesels and four AEG generators. The AEG electric motor is attached directly to a five- or seven-bladed propeller.|$|R
50|$|For general {{submersion}} or surfacing, submarines use {{the forward}} and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which {{are filled with}} water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick control of depth, submarines use smaller Depth Control Tanks (DCT) - also called hard tanks (due {{to their ability to}} withstand higher pressure), or <b>trim</b> <b>tanks.</b> The amount of water in depth control tanks can be controlled to change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's center of gravity, or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting trim.|$|R

She had two sets of diving planes, fore and aft, to control her depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission {{felt that she was}} generally successful except for her surface speed and range. It noted that she had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.|$|R

50|$|Only three {{ships were}} built in this group, S-1, S-2 and S-3, using {{partially}} German-supplied machinery. The boats were of semi-double hull type, with riveted pressure hull and welded light hull sections in the superstructure and extremities for improved seaworthiness. The sail was medium-sized and oval in plane, to reduce water drag. It housed the conning tower, the bridge, periscope fairings and a 45 mm (1.77 in) anti-aircraft gun. A net cutter was fitted atop the bow. The hull was separated into seven compartments, three of which were able to withstand 10 atm pressure. Nine main ballast tanks, separated into three groups (4 bow, 2 stern, 3 midships), together with a balancing tank and a quick dive tank {{were placed in the}} light hull. <b>Trimming</b> <b>tanks</b> were inside the pressure hull. Ballast tanks were emptied by pressurized air or engines exhaust, thus removing the need for ballast pumps.|$|R
500|$|Anxious to revenge {{themselves}} against the Austro-Hungarians, the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy) made plans for a sneak attack on the two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near Trieste, by MAS launches. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and Budapest at 02:32. The torpedoes fired at Budapest missed, but Wien was hit by two torpedoes fired by MAS 9, commanded by Lieutenant Commander (tenente di vascello) Luigi Rizzo, that blew a hole [...] wide abreast the boiler rooms. All of the watertight doors were open on board the Wien and the ship capsized in five minutes despite an attempt to counter her growing list by flooding the <b>trim</b> <b>tanks</b> on the opposite side. The attack killed 46 members of the crew. Both Italian boats escaped without being detected and Rizzo was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.|$|R
50|$|Submerging is done {{by opening}} the vents {{in the top of}} the ballast tanks, as well as opening the valves in the bottom. This allows water to flood into the tank, and allows the air already present inside the tank to escape through the top vents. as the air escapes from the tank, the vessel's {{buoyancy}} decreases, thus causing it to sink. In order for the submarine to surface, the vents {{in the top of the}} ballast tanks are shut, and compressed air is allowed into the tanks. The high-pressure air pocket pushes the water out through the bottom valves and increases the vessel's buoyancy, causing it to rise. A submarine may have several types of ballast tank: the main ballast tanks, which are the main tanks used for diving and surfacing, and <b>trimming</b> <b>tanks,</b> which are used to adjust the submarine's attitude (its 'trim') both on the surface and when underwater.|$|R
5000|$|The Molch {{was based}} on torpedo technology, and carried two G7e torpedoes {{attached}} externally {{on either side of}} the craft. It was fully electrical and was created for coastal operations, with a range of 64 km at 5 kn. The front section of the boat held a large battery. Behind the battery was the operator's position, which sat between two small <b>trimming</b> <b>tanks.</b> Behind the operator sat the electric motor. The complicated system of tanks made it difficult to control during combat operations. The first of 393 boats were delivered on June 12, 1944 and were built by AG Weser in Bremen.The Molch were first used in the Mediterranean against the Allied [...] "Operation Dragoon" [...] in 1944. The submarines were a part of the K-Verband 411 flotilla. On the night of September 25 they attacked Allied battleships, with the loss of ten out of the twelve Molch submarines in the flotilla. Shortly after, the remaining two were sunk by Allied warship bombardment off the Sanremo coast.|$|R
