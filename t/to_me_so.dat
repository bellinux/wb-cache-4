It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> neat, after the raggedness of our Western cities; so {{protected}} by good manners and courtesy—like an open-air drawing-room. I could well imagine a winter dancing party being given there, or a reception for some distinguished European visitor.|$|E
25|$|My {{sense of}} duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown {{pathological}} state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice {{in the first years}} of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.|$|E
25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E

500|$|Many episodes {{written by}} Lawrence develop {{and explore the}} {{relationship}} between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, [...] "I want more Karen on the show... The married life of an evil genius is the funniest thing <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> in that regard [...] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than just your typical bad guy." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Nader {{was fired}} from All My Children in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off. This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor's return. To {{partially}} appease them, the show's executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis. He rejected this offer because [...] "after being a major character for so long, it didn't make any sense <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> I declined. But if the network was interested in seriously discussing Dimitri's return on a contract basis I would love to go back." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>so,</b> I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Although both of Vonnegut's {{parents were}} fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country {{during and after}} World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon that culture to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach their {{youngest}} son German or introduce him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling [...] "ignorant and rootless." [...] Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper for the first 10 years of his life, for raising him and giving him values. [...] " [...] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> she was as great an influence on me as anybody." [...] Vonnegut described Young as [...] "humane and wise", adding that [...] "the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [...] beliefs" [...] came from her.|$|E

500|$|During the 1980s, many Japanese {{corporations}} {{relied on}} investments to bolster dwindling profits, particularly in its exports {{which had been}} eroded by a strong yen. Toshiro Shimoyama, Olympus president from 1984 to 1993, admitted to the Nikkei industrial daily newspaper in 1986: [...] "When the main business is struggling, we need to earn through zaitech" [...] (meaning [...] ). Olympus invested in financial derivatives and other risky investments to boost profits. However, Shimoyama said he [...] "does not remember" [...] any attempt to conceal losses (tobashi) during his tenure as president: [...] "As president it wasn't the case where all financial reports would come <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> I have no memory. During that time Masatoshi Kishimoto was the treasurer ... I wouldn't have heard financial details." [...] Kishimoto, Olympus president from 1993 to 2001, in turn denied involvement in tobashi, and instead suggested possible implication of Hideo Yamada, whom he said he supervised poorly.|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
5000|$|... "You Used <b>to</b> Hold <b>Me</b> <b>So</b> Tight" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{produced}} by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for American singer Thelma Houston's 1984 album Qualifying Heat.

500|$|What Love Is Made Of" [...] was premiered during Irish DJ Annie Mac's eponymous {{program on}} BBC Radio 1, on 10 May 2013, though its digital {{download}} only occurred on 5 July 2013. It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. To that question, she responded: [...] "I just felt that I wanted to put some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, but I loved collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] means a lot <b>to</b> <b>me</b> , <b>so</b> I wanted {{to get it out}} there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{resulting}} representation, {{also called the}} de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential.

2500|$|The album artwork {{is based}} on a {{painting}} by Hendrix himself in 1957.

When I saw this one he did in 1957, it screamed 'Valleys of Neptune' <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> we knew we'd use it for this project," [...] said his step-sister, Janie. The album artwork is a mix of his painting and a Linda McCartney photograph of him with a blue tint.|$|E

On December 20, 2011, Common {{released his}} ninth solo album titled The Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012's Cruel Summer. Common released a song entitled [...] "Sweet", from The Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artist Drake. Drake took offense and responded by releasing [...] "Stay Schemin'", a song with Rick Ross and French Montana. Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake's diss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying [...] "It's over. But {{it was all in}} the art of hip hop. He said some things <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> I had to say some things back...I wouldn't say [...] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> I addressed it.
