40|$|The <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> {{homegrown}} {{terrorism in the}} United States is called a new face of the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> terrorism. The {{aim of this study}} is to empirically examine how the new <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> {{homegrown terrorism}} has been constructed in the American discourse. Furthermore it is interesting to examine how the construction relates to the American counterterrorism policy and possible consequences. This is done by using the theoretical framework of Copenhagen’s school of securitization. By using a discourse analysis, documents and speeches from the U. S. government are analysed to see how the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> homegrown terrorism are constructed by using the securitization theory. This study concludes that the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> homegrown terrorism is constructed by portraying it as an existential threat to the United States, it’s people and it’s collective identity. The construction has made it possible to undertake exceptional actions that may reduce the American citizens’ freedom in benefit for security. ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E

The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security <b>threats.</b> <b>From</b> 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|E

Most species are non-migratory and live in their habitat year-round, although the North American red-breasted nuthatch migrates to warmer regions during the winter. A few nuthatch species have restricted ranges and face <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> deforestation.|$|E
