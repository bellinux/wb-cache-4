Social policy was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> that still {{received}} significant attention. By that autumn, Quisling and Mussert in the Netherlands could be satisfied they had at least survived. In 1944, the weight problems Quisling had been having during the preceding two years also eased.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Wars were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} {{that took place in}} New Zealand between 1845 and 1872. The two conflicts where soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross were the First Taranaki War of 18601861 and the Waikato-Hauhau Māori War of 18631866. The First Taranaki War was fought over land rights on New Zealand's North Island. The local Colonial Governor had set up a policy whereby the British Government could buy local land, and anyone refusing to sell their land would be committing treason against the Crown. When the Te Atiawa refused to sell their land, the British Army attacked on 17 March 1860, starting the First Taranaki War. After {{a series of}} sieges by the British, a truce was signed with the Māori people in March 1861; the disputed land became British-owned territory but it remained in possession of the Māori people. The First Taranaki War ended in a stalemate over <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> of disputed land. By 1863 the influx of settlers and consequent demand for land led to further conflict. In July 1863, the British Army and the Auckland Militia launched the Invasion of Waikato against the forces of Tāwhiao and the Māori King Movement. The British expelled the Māori people from their lands, swiftly moving south, culminating in the defeat and flight of Tāwhiao at Ōrākau in March 1864. The British pursued him across the country as far as the fourth Waikato defensive line, which later became the border of King Country.|$|E

500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the game that has {{attracted}} criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from Final Fantasy X.

Women's religious activities, including responsibility for mourning at funerals and involvement in female and mixed-sex cult activity, were an indispensable part of Athenian society. [...] Both Athenian and non-Athenian women participated in public religious activities. [...] The state-controlled Eleusinian mysteries, for instance, were open to all Greek speaking people, men and women, free and unfree alike.|$|E
500|$|On {{somewhat}} rare occasions, {{a thunderstorm}} can become stationary or nearly so while prolifically producing hail and significant depths of accumulation do occur; this tends {{to happen in}} mountainous areas, such as the July 29, 2010 case of a foot of hail accumulation in Boulder County, Colorado. On June 5, 2015, hail up to four feet deep fell on one city block in Denver, Colorado. [...] The hailstones, described as between the size of bumble bees and ping pong balls, were accompanied by rain and high winds. [...] The hail fell in only <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>area,</b> leaving the surrounding area untouched. [...] It fell for {{one and a half}} hours between 10 p.m. and 11:30p.m. A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder said, [...] "It's a very interesting phenomenon. [...] We saw the storm stall. It produced copious amounts of hail in one small area. It's a meteorological thing." [...] Tractors used to clear the area filled more than 30 dump-truck loads of hail.|$|E

500|$|Tod was not, however, universally {{respected}} in the East India Company. His immediate superior, David Ochterlony, was unsettled by Tod's rapid rise and frequent failure {{to consult with}} him. One Rajput prince objected to Tod's close involvement {{in the affairs of}} his state and succeeded in persuading the authorities to remove Marwar from Tod's area of influence. In 1821 his favouritism towards one party in a princely dispute, contrary to the orders given to him, gave rise to a severe reprimand and a formal restriction of his ability to operate without consulting Ochterlony, as well as the removal of Kota from his charge. Jaisalmer was then taken out of his sphere of influence in 1822, as official concerns grew regarding his sympathy for the Rajput princes. This and other losses of status, such as the reduction in the size of his escort, caused him to believe that his personal reputation and ability to work successfully in Mewar, by now <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> still left to him, was too diminished to be acceptable. He resigned his role as Political Agent in Mewar later that year, citing ill health. Reginald Heber, the Bishop of Calcutta, commented that ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{investigating}} Sound City {{recording studio}} in California, Mick Fleetwood heard the song [...] "Frozen Love" [...] from the Buckingham Nicks album. Impressed, he asked who the guitarist was. By chance, Buckingham and Nicks {{were also in}} Sound City recording demos, and Buckingham and Fleetwood were introduced. When Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac in December 1974, Fleetwood immediately contacted Buckingham and offered him the vacant guitar slot in his band. Buckingham told Fleetwood that he and Nicks were a team and that he didn't want to work without her. Fleetwood agreed to hire both of them, without an audition. Buckingham and Nicks then began a short tour to promote the Buckingham Nicks album. The touring band included drummers Bob Aguirre and Gary Hodges (playing simultaneously) and bassist Tom Moncrieff, who later played bass on Nicks' 1981 album Bella Donna. When they played in Alabama, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>area</b> where they saw appreciable sales, they told their fans they had joined Fleetwood Mac.|$|E
