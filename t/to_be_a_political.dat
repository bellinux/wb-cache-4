5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that there ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

25|$|After {{the wars}} were over, Kamo {{worked in the}} Soviet Customs office, by some {{accounts}} {{because he was too}} unstable to work for the secret police. Kamo died in a 1922 road accident when a truck hit him while he was cycling. The incident is widely believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> murder ordered by Stalin. Immediately after Kamo died, Stalin sent someone to collect all of Kamo's records and papers so that they would not embarrass Stalin.|$|E
25|$|The party proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> failure {{owing to}} its {{inability}} to conduct its activities in public and small size, combined with its extremely short lifespan. Nevertheless, the group has been regarded by intellectual historians as influential as a watershed {{in the process of}} demythologizing belief in the transformative essence of the peasant masses and in its abnegation of traditional Russian rejection of the norms of western constitutionalism as both a vehicle and a goal for change.|$|E
25|$|Following Svatopluk's death, Great Moravia, {{which had}} {{achieved}} its maximum territorial extension, and exercised its greatest influence in his reign, ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> factor in Central Europe. Among the conquered peoples, the Czechs {{were the first}} to withdraw already in 895. Although, at least according to the testimony of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Svatopluk had made a deathbed request to his sons that they remain united, after his death internal disagreements between his sons, Mojmír II and Svatopluk II were fostered by Arnulf. Finally Moravia collapsed {{in the first decade of}} the 10thcentury due to the invasion of the Hungarians.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, {{after the}} {{approval}} of the constitution, the second democratic election was carried out and the PCP raised its share of the vote to 14.56% and 40 seats. In the same year, the first Avante! Festival took place, and the eighth congress was held in Lisbon from 1114 November. The congress mainly stated the need to continue the quest for socialism in Portugal and the need to defend the achievements of the revolution against what the party considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> step backward, led by a coalition of the Socialist Party and the right-wing Centro Democrático Social, who opposed the agrarian reform process.|$|E
25|$|While {{the show}} does derive {{some of its}} humour from {{exploring}} the interactions of the Muslims with the non-Muslim townspeople of Mercy, and the contrast of conservative Islamic views (held primarily by the characters of Baber and Fatima) with more liberal interpretations of Islam (as represented by Amaar and Rayyan), at its core the show is essentially a traditional sitcom whose most unusual trait is {{the simple fact of}} being set among an underrepresented and misunderstood cultural community. Nawaz herself has stated that the show's primary agenda is to be funny, not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> platform. She has also stated that she views comedy {{as one of the most}} valuable and powerful ways to break down barriers and to encourage dialogue and understanding between cultures.|$|E
25|$|The National Alliance was {{organized}} in 1974.

(many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.|$|E

His life {{sentence in the}} Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided. He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail. There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued {{that they should not}} be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, Polk, {{fearful of}} French or British intervention, had sent Lieutenant Archibald H. Gillespie to California with orders to foment a pro-American {{rebellion}} {{that could be}} used to justify annexation of the territory. After meeting with Gillespie, Army captain John C. Frémont led settlers in northern California to overthrow the Mexican garrison in Sonoma in what became known as the Bear Flag Revolt. In August 1846, American forces under Kearny captured Santa Fe, capital of the province of New Mexico. Kearny captured Santa Fe without firing a shot, after the Mexican Governor, Manuel Armijo, fled from the province. At roughly the same time that Kearny captured Santa Fe, Commodore Robert F. Stockton landed in Los Angeles and proclaimed the capture of California. After American forces put down a revolt, United States held effective control of two northern Mexican provinces. However, the Western theater of the war would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> headache for Polk, as a dispute between Frémont and Kearny led to a break between Polk and the powerful Missouri Senator (and father-in-law of Frémont), Thomas Hart Benton.|$|E
25|$|While she-tragedies {{were more}} comfortably tragic, {{in that they}} showed women who {{suffered}} for no fault {{of their own and}} featured tragic flaws that were emotional rather than moral or intellectual, their success did not mean that more overtly political tragedy was not staged. The Exclusion crisis brought with it a number of tragic implications in real politics, and therefore any treatment of, for example, the Earl of Essex (several versions of which were circulated and briefly acted at non-patent theatres) could be read as seditious. Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd of 1682 was a royalist political play that, like Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel, seemed to praise the king for his actions in the meal tub plot. Otway's play had the floating city of Venice stand in for the river town of London, and it had the dark senatorial plotters of the play stand in for the Earl of Shaftesbury. It even managed to figure in the Duke of Monmouth, Charles's illegitimate, war-hero son who was favoured by many as Charles's successor over the Roman Catholic James. Venice Preserv'd is, in a sense, the perfect synthesis of the older politically royalist tragedies and histories of Dryden and the newer she-tragedies of feminine suffering, for, although the plot seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> allegory, the action centres on a woman who cares for a man in conflict, and most of the scenes and dialogue concern her pitiable sufferings at his hands.|$|E

500|$|Cibber's {{appointment}} as Poet Laureate in December 1730 was widely assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> rather than artistic honour, and {{a reward for}} his untiring support of the Whigs, the party of Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Most of the leading writers, such as Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and Henry Fielding, were excluded from contention for the laureateship because they were Tories. Cibber's verses had few admirers even in his own time, and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully {{that he did not}} think much of them. His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces incumbent on him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn, and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous parodies, some of which Cibber claimed in his Apology to have written himself. In the 20th century, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Lee considered some of Cibber's laureate poems funny enough to be included in their classic [...] "anthology of bad verse", The Stuffed Owl (1930). However, Cibber was at least as distinguished as his immediate four predecessors, three of whom were also playwrights rather than poets.|$|E

[...] Kazakh politicians emphasized the Eurasian Economic Union was not intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> bloc, but a purely economic union. Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the first deputy prime minister of Kazakhstan and lead negotiator, said, [...] "We are not creating a political organisation; we are forming a purely economic union."

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} [...] "Smells Like Nirvana", Yankovic's music career had {{suffered}} from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, UHF and the associated soundtrack. Yankovic called that [...] "the beginning of three years where {{it was kind of}} hard for me to recover". He started work on a new studio album around 1990. To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a Michael Jackson song, which had proven successful twice before with [...] "Eat It" [...] and [...] "Fat". He had composed a parody of Jackson's [...] "Black or White", titled [...] "Snack All Night", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that [...] "Snack All Night" [...] was not one of his better works. While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.|$|E
