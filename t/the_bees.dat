50|$|Donald {{is working}} while Spike <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> flies {{over to the}} tulip and Donald Duck plays a {{practical}} joke on <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> by almost drowning him in water. This proves to be a mistake as <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> gets revenge and attacks Donald Duck who defends himself with a bucket. Donald Duck tries to attack <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> on <b>the</b> building pole and loses balance and falls on the roped platform. Then <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> dives down at Donald Duck who swings at <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> with his mop and misses, Donald Duck spins, gets tangled in the rope and tied up. Spike <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> sees {{this as an opportunity}} to sting Donald Ducks exposed rear end. Donald Duck warns <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> not to touch him but <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> ignores Donald and dives for him, Donald Duck blows at <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> really hard until both Donald Duck and <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> gets tired out. <b>The</b> <b>bee</b> lands on <b>the</b> platform. <b>The</b> <b>bee</b> slowly gets up and aims his stinger into Donald's rear end which causes Donald Duck to yell and gets untied from the roped platform and dives headfirst into the drainpipe until his head comes out of the bottom of the drainpipe. Donald yells at Pluto for help but Pluto ignores Donald and shoves his head back into the drainpipe where Donald Duck continues to scream and goes back to sleep.|$|R

5|$|Bumblebees {{have been}} {{observed}} to partake in social learning. In a 2017 study involving Bombus terrestris, bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action performed by a magnet, indicating {{the importance of social}} information. <b>The</b> <b>bees</b> did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> were instead attempting to emulate each other's goals.|$|E

5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees.

40|$|Objectives : This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare antibacterial activities and free radical scavenging activity between <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom and Sweet Bee Venom in which the allergy-causing enzyme is removed. Methods : To evaluate antibacterial activities of the test samples, gram negative E. coli and gram positive St. aureus were compared using the paper disc method. For comparison of the antioxidant effects, DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay and Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) assay were conducted. Results : 1. Antibacterial activity against gram negative E. coli was greater in <b>the</b> Sweet <b>Bee</b> Venom group than <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom group. 2. Antibacterial activity against gram positive St. aureus was similar between <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom and Sweet Bee Venom groups. 3. DPPH free radical scavenging activity of <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom group showed 2. 8 times stronger than that of <b>the</b> Sweet <b>Bee</b> Venom group. 4. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation of <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom group showed 782 times greater than that of <b>the</b> Sweet <b>Bee</b> Venom group. Conclusions : <b>The</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom group showed outstanding antibacterial activity against gram positive St. aureus, and allergen-removed Sweet Bee Venom group showed outstanding antibacterial activity against both gram negative E. coli and gram positive St. aureus. For antioxidant effects, <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> Venom was superior over <b>the</b> Sweet <b>Bee</b> Venom and <b>the</b> superiority was far more apparent for lipid peroxidation...|$|R

5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost {{but not quite}} species specific, as {{it is possible for}} a few closely related bees to pollinate any given species of orchid, as long as <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E
5|$|This {{cladogram}} {{is based}} on Debevic et al, 2012, which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> (Anthophila) arose from deep within the Crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic.

5000|$|An {{example of}} this would be <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> and flower. Bee gets nectar and honey from flower. <b>The</b> <b>bee</b> {{contributes}} back to the flower by spreading the pollen so that the flowers can reproduce.This is a very common contribute to both the flower and <b>the</b> <b>bee,</b> they both rely on each other to survive.|$|R
50|$|Spike <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> is pollinating flowers outside Donald's {{house in}} his garden. He hears Donald Duck sing and {{mistakes}} the wallpaper for flowers. Donald Duck teases <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> by getting him stuck in glue and frees him causing <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> to hit <b>the</b> light and Donald Duck pushes him outside, shuts the window, But Spike <b>the</b> <b>Bee</b> gets revenge and removes the key from {{the lock and}} decides to sting Donald Ducks rear end but misses and gets stuck on the wallpaper glue. Donald Duck tugs with the wallpaper and Spike <b>the</b> <b>bee</b> frees himself from the glue. But this causes the wallpaper {{to stick to the}} ceiling with Donald Duck hands glued in the wallpaper.|$|R
5|$|On the {{strength}} of his performance for <b>the</b> <b>Bees,</b> Umbricht was promoted to the Pirates roster {{near the end of the}} 1959 season.

Umbricht left the game in position for the win, as the Pirates were leading 6–5, but reliever Don Gross gave up two earned runs in the ninth inning for the blown save and the loss.|$|E
5|$|Research in 2009 {{has found}} that an {{indicator}} for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens <b>the</b> <b>bees,</b> making them more vulnerable to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} their reproductive strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived from a variety of aromatic compounds. <b>The</b> <b>bees</b> store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E

5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>bees.</b> Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E
5|$|When bees become {{intoxicated}} from ethanol consumption or poisoned {{with other}} chemicals, their balance is affected, {{and they are}} wobbly when they walk. Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of <b>the</b> <b>bees.</b> Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E

40|$|Due to South Africa's {{history of}} {{apartheid}} {{the current regime}} have implemented the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policy to rectify the discrimination against previously disadvantaged groups. <b>The</b> <b>BEE</b> policy gives incentives for companies to hire non-whites in higher positions, like management, and the ambition with this is to create equality. With a qualitative research method and using an abductive approach this study research how South African SMMEs are influenced by <b>the</b> <b>BEE</b> policy when they internationalize. This study concludes that South African SMMEs are differently influenced by <b>the</b> <b>BEE</b> policy when they internationalize. Furthermore, this {{research shows that the}} impact is highly dependent on the business owners ethnicity. <b>The</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>BEE</b> policy had on black owned business was predominantly positive. However, <b>the</b> effect <b>the</b> <b>BEE</b> policy had on white owned businesses was more complex. As far as this research shows, <b>the</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>BEE</b> policy had on SMMEs when they internationalize are an extension of how <b>the</b> <b>BEE</b> policy influenced them in the domestic market. The authors recommendation is that <b>the</b> relationship between <b>BEE</b> and internationalization is further investigated and that this study is complemented with a quantitative research. ...|$|R
