5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because {{of these and}} other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E
5|$|In early 2000, Croatia and Serbia {{set up a}} {{commission}} tasked with determining the border, but in its first ten years it convened only once or twice. Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries. Plans for construction of a port in Apatin, {{on a piece of}} territory claimed by Croatia, added fuel to the dispute. After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> of opinions on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E

25|$|By 1880, {{the members}} of the X Club had {{prominent}} positions within the scientific community, and the club was highly regarded, but it was beginning to fall apart. In 1883, Spottiswoode died of typhoid and at the same time, according to Spencer, only two of the remaining eight members of the X club were in good health. Attendance at meetings began to dwindle and by 1885, Frankland and Lubbock urged for the election of new members. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> of opinion on the matter and it was eventually dropped. In 1889, a rift emerged in the group when Huxley and Spencer had an argument over land nationalisation policies and refused to talk with one another.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} A.G.N.A. was signed, Ribbentrop {{followed}} up with the next step that was intended to create the Anglo-German alliance, namely the Gleichschaltung (co-ordination) of all societies demanding the restoration of Germany's former colonies in Africa. On 3 July 1935, {{it was announced that}} Ribbentrop would head the efforts to recover Germany's former African colonies. Hitler and Ribbentrop believed that demanding colonial restoration would pressure the British into making an alliance with the Reich on German terms. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> of opinion between Ribbentrop and Hitler: Ribbentrop sincerely wished to recover the former German colonies, whereas for Hitler, colonial demands were just a negotiating tactic. Germany would renounce its demands in exchange for a British alliance.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in quality or performance between the two engines, there was no question that the engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way}} to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|Around AD 1720, an Irani-Zoroastrian priest named Jamasp Peshotan Velati {{travelled}} from Iran to India. Upon his arrival, {{he discovered}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> of a month between the Parsi calendar and his own calendar. Velati brought this discrepancy {{to the attention of}} the priests of Surat, but no consensus as to which calendar was correct was reached. Around AD 1740, some influential priests argued that since their visitor had been from the ancient 'homeland', his version of the calendar must be correct, and their own must be wrong. On 6 June 1745 AD (Julian), a number of Parsis in and around Surat adopted the calendar which had continued in use in Iran, now to be identified as the Qadimi reckoning. Other Parsis continued to use the reckoning which had become traditional in India, and call their calendar Shahanshahi.|$|E

25|$|When McLane entered Jackson’s cabinet he {{immediately}} assumed {{a position of}} leadership. Articulate, persuasive and energetic, he had mastered the issues under debate and was confident he could lead {{the others in the}} administration, including the President. Recognizing <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> of opinion with Jackson over the Bank, he sought to work out a plan with the bank president, Nicholas Biddle, to provide for the upcoming renewal of the bank’s charter in return for the accomplishment of a key objective of the President, the retirement of the national debt. On December 7, 1831 he proposed a sweeping plan to accomplish that and more. Acclaimed for its Hamiltonian creativity, McLane had taken the initiative on the administration’s agenda, and was acting very much in the role of a Prime Minister. With enough time he was certain Jackson would soften his position and consent to the approach.|$|E
25|$|On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss {{determined}} that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such {{as little as}} absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word little with tiny, Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word more and the suffix -er as comparatives by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions and and or as if they both meant and, but even after recognizing <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> never fully grasped the meaning of or. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of and while correctly responding to the word or fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood disjunction marked by the word or in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect two sentences.|$|E

500|$|On 16 September, Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen {{asked in}} Parliament if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> {{in the amount}} of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians, and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won {{compared}} to Olympians. Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports), said that on a per capita basis disabled sportspeople received about S$106,000 in the current financial year compared to S$54,000 for each able-bodied sportsperson as there were 794registered able-bodied sportspeople but only 16disabled ones. Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition, since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes. Further, cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore Totalisator Board and were not paid out of state funds. The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years, while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently. He said that the government was looking at how it could [...] "develop a system to accommodate all athletes that represent Singapore".|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} essay, Long insisted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between {{the study of}} nature and the study of science; whereas science {{concerned}} itself with laws and generalizations, the study of nature was far more complex as it allowed for the recognition of individual life forms. He wrote, [...] "The difference between Nature and Science is the difference between a man who loves animals, and so understands them, and the man who studies Zoology; it is the difference between the woman who cherishes her old-fashioned flower-garden and the professor who lectures on Botany in a college class-room." [...] Long's intention was to divide the old school naturalists (which included Burroughs among its members) from what he saw as the newly formed school, of which he was part, whose members were capable of seeing animals as individuals. Because he wrote personal nature essays, and not scientific reports, Long believed that his readers required from him [...] "not simply eyes and ears and a note-book; but insight, imagination, and, above all, an intense human sympathy, by which alone the inner life of an animal becomes luminous, and without which the living creatures are little better than stuffed specimens".|$|E
