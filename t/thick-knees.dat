5|$|The <b>thick-knees</b> are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the migratory}} species include the Mongolian plover, eastern curlew, grey-tailed tattler and bar-tailed godwit. Other birds seen the reserve include pied oystercatchers, beach <b>thick-knees,</b> darters, little black cormorants, white-faced herons, Australian white ibis, great egrets, grass owls, {{whistling}} kites and brahminy kites.|$|E

50|$|The stone-curlews, {{also known}} as dikkops or <b>thick-knees,</b> consist of nine species within the family Burhinidae, and are found {{throughout}} the tropical and temperate parts of the world, with two species found in Australia. Despite the group being classified as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|E
50|$|More {{species of}} Burhinus species {{are found in}} the tropics and sub-tropics, than other bioregions. They are {{generally}} sedentary and can live their whole lives within a few kilometres of hatching site. Eurasian stone-curlews are the exception, breeding in temperate areas and migrating south to avoid the northern winter. Birds from Britain and France will migrate to Italy, Greece, and Turkey and further. Bush stone-curlews will move to find food. Both Eurasian and Bush stone-curlews use a much larger area outside the breeding season. Double-striped, Peruvian and the Spotted <b>thick-knees</b> are rarely seen outside breeding areas while Senegal <b>thick-knees</b> will move based on rains in north.Burhinus are very typical in their requirements and are usually found in dry open country though the Senegal and Water <b>thick-knees</b> are associated with water. They can breed in arid and semi-arid habitats but not in closed woodland or forest. They are generally found in open spaces with extensive visibility on dry fairly even ground. Their habitat is usually a mixture of bare earth and vegetation with some species, like the Bush stone-curlew, found in lightly timbered, open forest and woodland. Eurasian stone-curlews are mostly found on free draining sandy soils with stones, both semi-natural and tilled. They will roost in the shade {{at the edge of a}} forest. Partly cleared farmland can be used as well but intense cultivation will drive them away. Burhinus are generally timid and wary, though in some case they may live close to humans using resources from dung and crops, as well as nesting on rooftops.|$|E
50|$|A {{phenotypic}} {{study of}} Charadriiformes suggests that Burhinidae should consist of three genera - Esacus, Burhinus plus resurrected Orthorhampus. In this model, the Bush stone-curlew would {{be removed from}} Burhinus {{and placed in a}} sub-family Esacinae with Esacus. This sub-family would be known as the Greater <b>Thick-knees,</b> while the remainder of the genus Burhinus would fall into Burhininae, the Lesser <b>Thick-knees.</b> This is based on character analyses of skeletons, skin and natal patterns. Esacus has sometimes been lumped within Burhinus, but Esacus are generally larger and chunkier with a larger bill and less mottled plumage. Burhinus is clearly distinct from Esacus, except for the Bush thick-knee, which is the same size as Esacus. However, the Bush thick-knee has more similar plumage to the rest of Burhinus. The Indian stone-curlew was split from the Eurasian species, as it does not migrate. It is possible that the population of Eurasian stone-curlews on the Canary Islands should also be split in this way as this population shows very little genetic variation.|$|E

5000|$|Location of Burhinus’ nests {{can vary}} {{and may be}} near {{vegetation}} or out in the open. The nest usually consists of a simple scrape that is sometimes lined with stones or shells. [...] Placement of nest site in different habitats such as heath-land or farmland can vary {{from year to year}} by the same pairs. If the vegetation becomes too tall, as can occur if nesting occurs within a crop, Burhinus will abandon the nest site. Senegal <b>thick-knee</b> will use grit, straw, wood and shells to line its nest, while Spotted <b>thick-knee</b> uses smaller animal dung and vegetation to line the nest. Double-striped <b>thick-knee</b> may also use dung to line their nest. Water <b>thick-knee</b> will use more lining than other species and usually place the nest near a piece of driftwood or vegetation, sometimes on elephant dung. [...] Bush stone-curlews nest under trees of open woodland with understorey of short sparse or lush grass, often near dead timber.|$|R
50|$|The crab-plover or {{crab plover}} (Dromas ardeola) is a bird {{related to the}} waders, but {{sufficiently}} distinctive to merit its own family Dromadidae. Its relationship within the Charadriiformes is unclear, some have considered it to be {{closely related to the}} <b>thick-knees,</b> or the pratincoles, while others have considered it closer to the auks and gulls. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Dromas and is unique among waders in making use of ground warmth to aid incubation of the eggs.|$|E
50|$|The Mekong Channel {{upstream}} of Vientiane Important Bird Area (IBA) is 18,230 hectares in size. As {{its name}} implies it comprises an approximately 300 km {{section of the}} Mekong Channel upstream of Vientiane city. It is situated in two provinces: Vientiane and Sainyabuli. The topography features braided streams, bushland, gravel bars, open sandy islands, rock outcrops, and sand bars. Notable avifauna include great <b>thick-knees</b> (Esacus recurvirostris), Jerdon's bushchat (Saxicola jerdoni), river lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii), small pratincole (Glareola lactea), and wire-tailed swallow (Hirundo smithii). Around the village of Ban Sivilay, a bird sanctuary has large flocks of whistling ducks and egrets roosting.|$|E
50|$|All Burhinus have a {{complete}} post-breeding moult which can take 4-5 months. The primaries are lost in descending sequence. The Eurasian and Senegal <b>thick-knees</b> may suspend moulting of primaries in winter and finish in spring, leading to an overlap of moulting and breeding. It is very unusual for breeding and moulting to overlap, and the slow moult may possibly be to maximise re-nesting potential. Burhinus’ secondary feathers are usually not replaced in one season, with {{the inner and outer}} feather being shed first. A pre-breeding moult may just be the head and neck and sometimes not at all. Once they have fledged, juvenile Burhinus will moult only their head and body, some wing-coverts and central tail. Juveniles will moult their secondary wing feathers after their first winter. This can be helpful when estimating the age of young birds.|$|E

5000|$|Burhinus can be sociable with non-breeding {{flocks of}} dozens to {{hundreds}} using traditional sites In Europe, 300 or more Eurasian stone-curlews {{have been seen}} together at times, whilst in Tunisia, 150 have been recorded together. Non-breeding Spotted stone-curlews can sometimes be found in loose flocks of 50 also during breeding season. [...] Peruvian <b>thick-knees</b> {{are more likely to}} stay in large flocks year round in Chile than in Peru, where flocks increase after breeding. Variations in flocking behaviour over the species range may be influenced by differences in local predation, foraging and climate pressures. The resting position of Burhinus may be more upright than when feeding, with the head hunched at shoulder and tail down, tarsus on ground and tibia upright. If alarmed, Burhinus will bob their head, they will then freeze or walk away if possible, rather than flying.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{disturbances}} {{will cause}} parents to quietly leave nest, while more serious threats will {{cause them to}} defend the nest. This can include distraction displays and aggressive behaviour, though very occasionally a broken wing display has been observed. The non-incubating parent will spot danger and warn their mate. The alarm is raised with a special posture. The sitting bird will walk away then runs and flies off, while the other bird flies in different direction. They will both turn back and meet, and watch to see {{what will become of}} the disturbance. The male will follow intruder if it leaves, whilst the female will carefully return. The pair will attack ground predators, diving, wings out and neck forward. On the other hand, they will stand upright wing fanned against herbivore that may trample the eggs or chicks. If chicks are not lost to the threat, the parents will lead them to a new area. Senegal <b>thick-knees</b> will watch humans at nest and then return quite quickly even if watched.|$|E
5000|$|It is very {{difficult}} to know the true status of this genus, as its species are so secretive. There is just enough data to show that most species of Burhinus have been affected by interference. Some species have suffered steep declines in some areas leading to local extinction. Habitat destruction, urban development, intense cultivation, forestry, tourism, subdivisions, over grazing and burning, as well as introduced predators are some of the factors threatening Burhinus. The most study has been done on the Eurasian stone-curlew. In Britain, sensitive management of grazing in heathlands, setting aside patches within crops, and the protection of nests from predators, machinery and stock has led to a halt of the very sharp decline of the Eurasian stone-curlew, with this population now stable though not increasing. [...] Modelling the habitat required for stone-curlews, as well as the use of ringing recovery, geo-locators and GPS data loggers, has also helped to determine which areas are important to protect for Eurasian stone-curlews in both Britain and Italy. [...] The Bush stone-curlew has contracted in its range, with reduced numbers or local extinction in the south and east.The African <b>thick-knees</b> will often live alongside people and generally ignore them. In these places, the populations seem stable and stone-curlews will use the resources provided by humans such as feeding on insects in livestock dung and nesting on roofs. Some modification seems to be beneficial where suitable habitat is produced as a result, for example along road-sides for the American species, however this can lead to mortality as well.|$|E

50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted <b>thick-knees</b> (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (Quelea quelea) and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E
40|$|Flocking {{behaviour}} {{in birds}} reflects {{the outcome of}} a momentary trade-off between increased foraging efficiency and improved predator avoidance. However, these changing patterns remain poorly known at any spatial or temporal scale. The aim {{of the present study was}} first to investigate seasonal fluctuations of flocking behaviour throughout the entire distribution range of a species and secondly to explore behavioural responses to daily temperature variations. From 2000 to 2010, sightings of Peruvian <b>Thick-knees</b> (Burhinus superciliaris) were collected throughout Ecuador, Peru and Chile. There were strong differences in flocking behaviour between Chilean and Peruvian populations. While <b>Thick-knees</b> occurred into few large year-round flocks in Chile, flock occurrence was highly seasonal in Peru, where group size grew gradually from loose flocks at the end of the breeding season to a few large ones by the middle of the year. Time of day seemed not to affect the species detectability but was negatively related to flock size. Variations in the flocking behaviour of Peruvian <b>Thick-knees</b> throughout its distribution range suggest that aggregation patterns might indicate individuals responding to seasonally fluctuating ecological pressures, such as those derived from predation, foraging or climate. © 2011 Springer-Verlag and ISPA.

40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenetic {{hypotheses}} of higher-level {{relationships in}} the order Charadriiformes based on morphological data, partly disagree with those based on DNA-DNA hybridisation data. So far, these relationships have not been tested by analysis of DNA sequence data. Herein we utilize 1692 bp of aligned, nuclear DNA sequences obtained from 23 charadriiform species, representing 15 families. We also test earlier suggestions that bustards and sandgrouses may be nested with the charadriiforms. The data is analysed with methods based on the parsimony and maximum-likelihood criteria. Results Several novel phylogenetic relationships were recovered and strongly supported by the data, regardless of which method of analysis was employed. These include placing the gulls and allied groups as a sistergroup to the sandpiper-like birds, {{and not to the}} plover-like birds. The auks clearly belong to the clade with the gulls and allies, and are not basal to most other charadriiform birds as suggested in analyses of morphological data. Pluvialis, which has been supposed to belong to the plover family (Charadriidae), represents a basal branch that constitutes the sister taxon to a clade with plovers, oystercatchers and avocets. The <b>thick-knees</b> and sheathbills unexpectedly cluster together. Conclusion The DNA sequence data contains a strong phylogenetic signal that results in a well-resolved phylogenetic tree with many strongly supported internodes. Taxonomically it is the most inclusive study of shorebird families that relies on nucleotide sequences. The presented phylogenetic hypothesis provides a solid framework for analyses of macroevolution of ecological, morphological and behavioural adaptations observed within the order Charadriiformes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{compares the}} visual {{function}} of the Double-striped Thick-knee (Burhinus bistriatus Wagler, 1829), which forages primarily during dusk and at night, and the Southern Lapwing (Vanellus chilensis L., 1758), which is known to forage during daytime and occasionally at night, analyzing morphological and electrophysiological aspects of their retina. The fact that <b>thick-knees</b> have large eyes and are nocturnally actives suggest that, compared with the diurnal lapwing, {{they should have a}} very sensitive retina under low light intensity.

The scotopic ERG b-waves of B. bistriatus, at all light intensities, were always of larger amplitude than those of V. chilensis. However, the a-waves of both species were of similar amplitude. Under photopic conditions, V. chilensis yield highest a- and b-wave amplitudes than B. bistriatus. The latter has a larger dialated pupil diameter and a greater axial length/equatorial diameter ratio than V. chilensis. Likewise, the rod density of B. bistriatus significantly exceeds that of V. chilensis. In the latter, cone density tends to be higher than in B. bistriatus while the rods:cones ratio were lower. Rod outer segments of B. bistriatus strongly exceed in length those of any other Charadriiformes species studied so far, but are thinner than those of V. chilensis. In contrast, the latter has thicker cone outer segments and outer and inner plexiform layers than B. bistriatus. Similarly, ganglion cells are more abundant per unit area in V. chilensis. Our combined results reveal a higher retinal sensitivity of B. bistriatus under low light conditions, in accordance with their crepuscular and nocturnal foraging strategies. V. chilensis, although mainly active during daylight, appears to have a moderate retinal sensitivity under low light conditions. Thus, we conclude that Southern Lapwings present visual adaptations that enable them to function in nocturnal as well as in diurnal conditions...|$|E
