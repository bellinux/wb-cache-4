5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic <b>text</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|The Narrator – as {{in other}} works of metafiction, the narrator's voice {{frequently}} intervenes in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears {{to be that of}} Fowles, Magali Cornier Michael notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author's role in the <b>text</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> narrator's. Alice Ferrebe describes the narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of the perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze.|$|E

5|$|There were minor {{differences}} between the original <b>text</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> version published by Princeton. In the Princeton publication, first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations. In response to public concerns about radioactivity, Groves had text added to paragraph 12.18 explaining how {{the height of the}} explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up into the upper atmosphere. He also had a one-sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in the production reactors redacted. This deletion was soon noticed by the Russian translators, and only served to highlight its importance to the Soviet atomic bomb project.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of features from The Art of War in other historical texts {{is considered to}} be proof of his historicity and authorship. Certain strategic concepts, such as terrain classification, are attributed to Sun Tzu. Their use in other works such as The Methods of the Sima is considered proof of Sun Tzu's historical priority. According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name. It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the <b>text</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or students may have revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.|$|E
5|$|The book's current {{dimensions}} are 330 by 250mm. Originally, the folios were of no standard size, {{but they were}} cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book {{must have been the}} product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries. Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the <b>text</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> absence of certain key illustrations.|$|E

Each item on the badge, each colour, each item of <b>text</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shape of the shield, in combination, are symbolic of Australia's military traditions, the individual Australian soldier's reputation in combat and, in particular, the AATTV's record of valour.
