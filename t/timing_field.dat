40|$|The {{continued}} {{spread of}} glyphosate-resistant common waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) Sauer (syn. rudis) ] and Palmer amaranth [Amaranthus palmeri (S. Wats.) ] have complicated weed control efforts in soybean and corn production in Illinois. A {{thorough understanding of}} the weed biology of these species is fundamental in developing effective weed management strategies. The determination of emergence patterns {{as well as the}} influence of tillage practices on soil microclimate and soil seed bank will allow control strategies to be implemented at the most effective <b>timing.</b> <b>Field</b> experiments were conducted in southern Illinois throughout the growing season of 2013 and 2014 on two separate sites with populations of common waterhemp and Palmer amaranth. Three tillage treatments were evaluated: no-tillage; early tillage, preferably performed around a recommended soybean planting date of May 1 st; and late tillage, preferably performed on June 1 st to simulate a late soybean planting. Amaranthus seedlings were identified and enumerated in the center 1 m 2 quadrat of each plot within a 7 -day interval from April through November or first frost. All weed seedlings were removed from the plot area after each enumeration. Soil temperature and soil moisture were recorded hourly throughout the experiment using data loggers established in the plot area. First emergence of common waterhemp occurred earlier in the season than did Palmer amaranth. In 2013, initial emergence of common waterhemp and Palmer amaranth was observed at the first and second week of May, respectively. In 2014, initial common waterhemp emergence was observed in late April, while Palmer amaranth initial emergence was similar to previous year. Palmer amaranth emerged over a longer period compared to waterhemp. By the end of June, 90 % of common waterhemp had emerged regardless of tillage or year. By the same measure, Palmer amaranth emergence was extended to the third week of July and second week of August in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Soil temperature did not differ across tillage treatments in both years. On the other hand, differences in soil moisture were observed, mostly over two weeks following each tillage operation. The single best predictor for common waterhemp emergence was soil temperature (weekly highs and lows) followed by soil moisture. For Palmer amaranth emergence the single best predictor was spikes in soil moisture (high for the week). In 2013, common waterhemp emergence was initially positively and later in the growing season negatively interacted with maximum temperature 13 days prior to counts, with temperatures above 30 C observed with decreased emergence (R 2 = 0. 35). In the same year spikes in soil moisture interacted with Palmer amaranth emergence were those observed 11 days before each seedling enumeration date (R 2 = 0. 30). In 2014, with first common waterhemp emergence in April, a positive interaction to high soil temperature was initially observed followed by a positive interaction to minimum temperatures later in the season (R 2 = 0. 55). Spikes in soil moisture observed 2 weeks prior to emergence and weekly high temperatures 8 days prior to emergence were the best predictors of Palmer amaranth emergence in 2014 (R 2 = 0. 37). Soil seed bank depletion was also estimated by comparing field emergence with greenhouse experiment results of soil seed bank estimation. Greater emergence of common waterhemp from the soil seed bank was observed in early tillage in 2013 and no-tillage in 2014 than late tillage, respectively; for Palmer amaranth, the greatest emergence from the soil seed bank was observed in no-tillage and late tillage in 2013, and no-tillage, in 2014. The emergence patterns observed in this research suggest that although common waterhemp and Palmer amaranth exhibit discontinuous emergence throughout the growing season, greater attention should be placed on managing peaks of emergence from late April to late July, which is critical to provide a foundation for early-season weed management. Furthermore, knowledge regarding the emergence patterns of common waterhemp and Palmer amaranth combined with monitoring environmental factors such as soil moisture and soil temperature may assist efforts for scouting fields to determine the likely presence of these weed species. The timing of viable postemergence herbicide options for control of glyphosate-resistant waterhemp and Palmer amaranth is critical and monitoring weather patterns to direct scouting efforts may improve the timeliness of these postemergence applications...|$|E

However, because the moth’s observed range has expanded into the northern and eastern United States, there is concern that suitable temperatures before May could allow for significant S. albicosta development. Daily blacklight moth catch and temperature data from four Nebraska locations were used to construct degree-day models using simple or sine-wave methods, starting dates between 1 January and 1 May, and lower (– 5 to 15 °C) and upper (20 to 43. 3 °C) developmental thresholds. Predicted dates of flight from these models were compared with observed flight dates using independent datasets to assess model performance.

Regional {{knowledge of}} CRC activity and biology is limited making {{the development of}} pest management strategies difficult. One potential management technique for soil-dwelling pests {{is the use of}} biofumigant containing cover crops. Biofumigation can affect the survival and behavior of pest insects. However, biofumigant crops have not been evaluated against CRC or as a rotational crop compatible with alfalfa. The goals of this research were to determine 1) phenology, population sizes, and root damage severity of CRC occurring in the Intermountain region and 2) the direct and indirect suppressive effects of biofumigant cover crop incorporations on CRC and its agronomic compatibility in rotation with alfalfa. First, I observed that larval activity occurred from mid-spring to mid-summer and local larval densities were generally lower than those reported in the eastern U. S. Adult CRC began emerging from the soil in mid-summer having two population peaks. After the second fall peak of adults was when most eggs were deposited which continued through early winter. CRC damage to taproots was cumulative, increasing as stands age, with most damage occurring in {{the first few years of}} stand life and mostly occurring in the top 20 cm of roots. While the incorporation of biofumigant crops appeared to be compatible with alfalfa and did not negatively affect yield, in field trials, biofumigation did not suppress CRC, disrupt egg laying, or decrease feeding damage.

In terms of security IDEA algorithm is very much superior where as in terms of <b>timings</b> Galois <b>field</b> is much better and is already patented of Ascom. These are cryptographic algorithm used for security purpose. The Galois field property of multiplication is XORing based process along with the use of irreducible polynomial selected by National Institute of Standard Technology that retains the multiplication result to the same number of bits as that of the multiplier & multiplicand bit. The encrypted result can thus be used for secure data transmission and is hatched at the decoder end using the FPGA lookup table which uses the symmetric key. We have investigated different encoded result using encoding algorithm. Simulation result of Galois field algorithm shows that using Galois multiplication property a 4 x 4 bit multiplication yields an output of 4 bit result. Thus it reduces the number of bits in results and encodes the data too. This can be implemented in cryptographic applications where as in IDEA Algorithm the whole algorithm is divided into modules and among all of them the most time consuming one is the modulo multiplication module. The IDEA algorithm that is used computes the product in a recursive fashion and it uses divide and conquer approach during multiplication which ultimately consumes less time and increases the through put in the algorithm. The block size considered here is the same as of traditional IDEA encryption algorithm. In IDEA for synthesis we have used Xylinx 9. 2 i and for simulation we have used modelsim 10. 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{economic and}} agronomic impacts of gradual climate warming are examined {{at the farm}} level. Three models of the relevant climatic, agronomic, and economic processes are developed and linked to address climate change impacts and agricultural adaptability. Several climate warming scenarios are analyzed, which vary in severity. The results indicate that grain farmers in southern Minnesota can effectively adapt to a gradually changing climate (warmer and either wetter or drier) by adopting later maturing cultivars, changing crop mix, and altering the <b>timing</b> of <b>field</b> operations {{to take advantage of}} a longer growing season resulting from climate warming. Key words: discrete stochastic sequential prograrnming, gradual climate warming, Minnesota. This paper examines potential economic and ag-ronomic impacts of gradual climate warming at the farm level. Three models of the relevant cli-matic, agronomic, and economic processes are developed and linked to address climate change impacts and agricultural adaptability. While the model could be adapted and applied to any re-gion of the United States, a grain farm in south-ern Minnesota is used here asa case study. This region is part of the northern fringe of the U. S. corn belt which could be affected by climate warming. Several climate warming scenarios are analyzed, which vary in severity to simulate how sensitive crop yields, crop mix, and farm rev-enue are to climate change. This research differs from most previous analyses of climate change in three respects.
