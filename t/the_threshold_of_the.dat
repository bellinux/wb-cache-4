25|$|On 5 March 1967, a Varig Douglas DC-8-33 {{registration}} PP-PEA {{operating flight}} 837 from Rome-Fiumicino to Monrovia caught fire after a mistaken approach to Monrovia, missing <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> runway by 6,023ft. Of the 90 {{passengers and crew}} aboard 51 died as well as 5 on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Bay of Fundy tides are {{the highest}} in the world and the highest of all occur in the Minas Basin. Several factors affect the Fundy tides {{including}} water depth and the shape of the coastline. Both contribute to a natural Fundy tidal oscillation, or flow of water back and forth, of about half a day, almost matching the half-day tidal cycle of the outside North Atlantic. This matching tidal cycle amplifies Fundy's tidal range as water flows in and out of the Bay across <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Maine.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this method}} is limited to {{detecting}} relatively recent HGT events. Indeed, if the HGT occurred in the common ancestor {{of two or more}} species included in the database, the closest hit will reside within that clade and therefore the HGT will not be detected by the method. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minimum number of foreign top BLAST hits to observe to decide a gene was transferred is highly dependent on the taxonomic coverage of sequence databases. Therefore, experimental settings may need to be defined in an ad-hoc way.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consultant}} to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), Laue met Walther Meissner who was working there on superconductivity. Meissner had discovered that a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the Meissner effect. Laue showed in 1932 that <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied magnetic field which destroys superconductivity varies with the shape of the body. Laue published a total of 12 papers and a book on superconductivity. One of the papers was co-authored with Fritz London and his brother Heinz. Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} planes {{belong to the}} subtle sphere, the fourth is on the {{threshold}} between the subtle and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the mental sphere. The first plane starts from <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gross and the subtle sphere. The soul here starts experiencing subtle phenomena simultaneously through its gross and subtle senses. It starts hearing subtle sounds and smelling subtle scents, although their nature is far different from their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving the subtle world through its subtle body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to subtle impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of the subtle world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|E

25|$|Chirped-pulse {{amplification}} {{was originally}} introduced as {{a technique to}} increase the available power in radar in 1960. CPA for lasers was invented by Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland at the University of Rochester in the mid 1980s. Before then, the peak power of laser pulses was limited because a laser pulse at intensities of gigawatts per square centimeter causes serious damage to the gain medium through nonlinear processes such as self-focusing. For example, {{some of the most}} powerful compressed CPA laser beams, even in an unfocused large aperture (after exiting the compression grating) can exceed intensities of 700 gigawatts/cm2, which if allowed to propagate in air or the laser gain medium would instantly self focus and form a plasma or cause filament propagation, both of which would ruin the original beam's desirable qualities and could even cause back-reflection potentially damaging the laser's components. In order to keep the intensity of laser pulses below <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear effects, the laser systems had to be large and expensive, and the peak power of laser pulses was limited to the high gigawatt level or terawatt level for very large multi beam facilities.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} to {{take stock}} of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher summer pastures. It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E
500|$|The Whites and Reds {{carried out}} {{political}} violence, called the Red and White terror, [...] by executions. <b>The</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violence had been crossed by the Finnish Activists, in the First Period of Russification. The large scale terror {{was born and}} bred in [...] Europe during World War I [...] - [...] the first [...] total war. The February and October Revolutions initiated the political violence in Finland, at first by Russian army troopers executing their officers, later between the Finnish Reds and Whites.|$|E

50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, a quinquennial visit ad limina, {{more fully}} ad limina apostolorum or simply an ad limina visit, means <b>the</b> {{obligation}} <b>of</b> residential diocesan bishops and certain prelates with territorial jurisdiction (such as territorial abbots), <b>of</b> visiting <b>the</b> <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apostles, Saints Peter and Paul, and <b>of</b> meeting <b>the</b> pope {{to report on}} <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> their dioceses or prelatures.|$|R

500|$|Coenred was tonsured in Rome, whence he was {{accompanied}} by Offa, son of Sighere, king of the East Saxons, and became a monk [...] "at <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apostles" [...] as Bede had it; he stayed in Rome until his death, the date of which is unknown. [...] He is not recorded as having a wife or children. The Evesham Chronicle kept at Evesham Abbey, however, claim {{that he was an}} ancestor of Wigstan. They do not say whether this was through Wigstan's father, Wigmund, son of Wiglaf of Mercia, or through his mother, Ælfflæd, daughter of Ceolwulf I of Mercia.|$|E

500|$|The {{hermeneutic}} {{style was}} possibly first {{seen in the}} Metamorphoses of Apuleius in the second century, {{and it is also}} found in works by late Latin writers such as Ammianus Marcellinus and Martianus Capella. In Britain and Ireland, the style is found in authors on <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medieval period including the British monk Gildas, the Irish missionary Columbanus and the Anglo-Saxon bishop Aldhelm, and works such as the Hisperica Famina. The Anglo-Saxons were the first people in Europe who had to learn Latin as a foreign language when they converted to Christianity, and in Lapidge's view: [...] "That they attained stylistic mastery in a medium alien to them is remarkable in itself".|$|E

500|$|Born in {{the sacred}} {{highland}} village of Alasora to King Andriamanelo and Queen Randapavola, Ralambo {{was the only one}} of his parents' children to survive to adulthood. [...] According to one legend, as a child he may have been known by the name Rabiby, being given the name Ralambo after successfully killing a particularly ferocious wild boar (lambo) in the woods. Another story attributes his name to a wild boar that walked past <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house where his mother was resting shortly after giving birth to him. However, both of these explanations are likely to have originated at some point after his reign; it is more probable that he took the name Ralambo after propagating the consumption of the meat of the zebu, called lambo in the proto-Malagasy language and the Malayo-Polynesian tongue from which it derived.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of January 1883, Mahler became conductor at the Royal Municipal Theatre in Olmütz (now Olomouc) in Moravia. He later wrote: [...] "From the moment I crossed <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Olmütz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God." [...] Despite poor relations with the orchestra, Mahler brought nine (13 times) operas to the theatre, including the new Bizet's Carmen, and won over the press that had initially been sceptical to him. After a week's trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel, Mahler became the theatre's [...] "Musical and Choral Director" [...] from August 1883. The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre's Kapellmeister, Wilhelm Treiber, who disliked him (and vice-versa) {{and set out to}} make his life miserable. Despite the unpleasant atmosphere, Mahler had moments of success at Kassel. He directed a performance of his favourite opera, Weber's Der Freischütz, and 25 other operas. on 23 June 1884, he conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von Scheffel's play Der Trompeter von Säckingen ("The Trumpeter of Säckingen"), the first professional public performance of a Mahler work. An ardent, but ultimately unfulfilled, love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen ("Songs of a Wayfarer").|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn objective, fast, and {{reasonably}} accurate assessment test {{that allows for}} easy interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearing <b>thresholds</b> at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve <b>the</b> medicolegal aspects <b>of</b> an occupational hearing injury. This study evaluated <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSR) to predict <b>the</b> hearing <b>thresholds</b> in workers exposed to high levels <b>of</b> noise. <b>The</b> study sample included 34 workers with noise-induced hearing impairment. <b>Thresholds</b> <b>of</b> pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and Mf-ASSRs at four frequencies were assessed.
