40|$|Post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} (PTGS) {{has been shown}} to occur in many transgenic dicotyledonous plants. Although trans{{gene silencing}} has been documented in transgenic monocots, PTGS has been only recently de-scribed in monocotyledonous plants. To study PTGS in rice, we generated 25 transgenic rice cell lines in which the 35 S-gus gene was stably integrated. In one transgenic cell line, lack of gus expression was shown to be caused by PTGS {{based on the results of}} run-on transcription assays. Furthermore, to examine whether reintroduction of the same plasmid DNA into cells in which <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> gene was highly expressed causes the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> expres-sion, <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> plasmid was introduced into protoplasts iso-lated from a high gws-expressing line. Results of the kinetic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> activities in transfected protoplasts indicated that <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> expression in transfected protoplasts was suppressed by <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> plasmid but not by the luc plasmid harboring the 35 S-luciferase gene, suggesting that suppression of <b>the</b> <b>gus</b> expression by introduced plasmid DNA was homology-dependent. These results suggest that the transgenic protoplasts may be a useful experimental system to study PTGS in rice and other species.

40|$|Commercial {{cultivation}} of the mushroom fungus, Agaricus bisporus, utilizes a substrate {{consisting of a}} lower layer of compost and upper layer of peat. Typically, the two layers are seeded with individual mycelial inoculants representing a single genotype of A. bisporus. Studies aimed at examining the potential of this fungal species as a heterologous protein expression system have revealed unexpected contributions of the mycelial inoculants in the morphogenesis of the fruiting body. These contributions were elucidated using a dual-inoculant method whereby the two layers were differientially inoculated with transgenic b-glucuronidase (GUS) and wild-type (WT) lines. Surprisingly, use of a transgenic <b>GUS</b> line in <b>the</b> lower substrate and a WT line in the upper substrate yielded fruiting bodies expressing GUS activity while lacking <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> transgene. Results of PCR and RT-PCR analyses for <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> transgene and RNA transcript, respectively, suggested translocation of <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> protein from <b>the</b> transgenic mycelium colonizing the lower layer into the fruiting body that developed exclusively from WT mycelium colonizing the upper layer. Effective translocation of <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> protein depended {{on the use of}} a transgenic line in the lower layer in which <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> gene was controlled by a vegetative mycelium-active promoter (laccase 2 and b-actin), rather than a fruiting body-active promoter (hydrophobin A). GUS-expressing fruiting bodies lacking <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> gene had a bonafide WT genotype, confirmed by the absence of stably inherited GUS and hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker activities in their derived basidiospores and mycelial tissue cultures...|$|R

5|$|In 1943, {{after school}} and having {{enrolled}} at university, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him {{to listen to the}} greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker's virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{soldiers}} using <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> Bill after World War II {{stressed the}} state university system {{to the point that}} a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened {{on the campus of the}} Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field. By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it Florida State University. The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College. The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), Library Science, Nursing and Social Welfare. Strozier Library, Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building were also built at this time.|$|E

40|$|Three novel maize {{promoters}} (Gos- 2, Enolase and Actin- 2) {{were evaluated}} for their efficiency in driving <b>the</b> <b>GUS</b> gene expression in plant tissues.

5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} <b>the</b> <b>G.I.</b> Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge {{as if it were}} dishonorable.|$|E
