5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. <b>That</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, {{a new law}} was put {{in place}} in order to prevent both the {{demolition}} of tile-covered buildings across the country, and the initiation of renovating operations <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> the removal of tiles, even if they only affect the building's interior.|$|E
25|$|Pangasinan {{was founded}} by Austronesian peoples who called {{themselves}} Anakbanwa during the Austronesian expansion from Taiwan and Southern China in about 5000 - 2500 BC or the Austronesian dispersal from Sundaland at least 7,000 years ago after the last Ice Age. Anakbanwa means “child of banwa.” Banwa (also spelled banua or vanua) is an Austronesian concept <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> territory, homeland, habitat, society, civilization or cosmos. The Pangasinan people identified or associated banwa with the sun, which was their symbol for their banwa. The Pangasinan people {{are closely related to}} the Ibaloi in the neighboring province of Benguet and other peoples of Luzon. The Anakbanwa established their settlements in the banks of the Agno River and the coasts of Lingayen Gulf. The coastal area {{came to be known as}} Pangasinan, and the interior area came to be known as Kaboloan. Eventually, the whole region, its people and the used language came to be known as Pangasinan. Archaeological evidence and early Chinese and Indian records show that the inhabitants of Pangasinan traded with India, Arabia, China and Japan as early as the 8th century A.D.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his success}} with the film Titanic, {{director}} James Cameron teamed up with Charles H. Eglee. The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series, eventually deciding {{on the idea of}} Dark Angel. Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who appeared normal but was different on a genetic level, saying [...] "We explored what <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean.</b> Do her eyes look different? Were there things that manifest themselves? Were there negatives to it? We wanted her to have flaws, things that were built inlike Kryptonite." [...] Max followed a long line of strong female characters in films directed Cameron, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley. Cameron believes such characters are well received all round as women respond favourably to strong female characters and male audiences [...] "want to see girls kick ass".|$|E
500|$|Speer made a {{deliberate}} {{effort to make}} as productive a use of his time as possible. He wrote, [...] "I am obsessed {{with the idea of}} using this time of confinement for writing a book of major importance... <b>That</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> transforming prison cell into scholar's den." [...] The prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs, and mail was severely limited and censored. However, {{as a result of an}} offer from a sympathetic orderly, Speer was able to have his writings, which eventually amounted to 20,000 sheets, sent to Wolters. By 1954, Speer had completed his memoirs, which became the basis of Inside the Third Reich, and which Wolters arranged to have transcribed onto 1,100 typewritten pages. He was also able to send letters and financial instructions, and to obtain writing paper and letters from the outside. His many letters to his children, all secretly transmitted, eventually formed the basis for Spandau: The Secret Diaries.|$|E

2500|$|Most entomological {{evidence}}, or evidence {{dealing with}} the presence of insect larvae or adults being found at a scene, enters through expert witness testimony. [...] Because there is little common knowledge associated with the discovery of particular larvae at a crime, it is useful for an entomologist to come in and explain what they found and what <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> in regards to the location of death, the time of death, and other various parts of the case.

2500|$|IGN {{published}} another preview on July 26. By this stage, {{the combat}} system had been finalized, but writer Hilary Goldstein was unconvinced by it. He criticized {{the fact that}} the player couldn't control what type of attack Blade did at any given time (punch, kick, elbow etc.). Instead all that the player could do was control the direction in which he attacked. He also criticized the lack of a lock-on during melee combat, and felt the system in general seemed unfinished; [...] "it sounds simple, but somehow it doesn't translate properly to gameplay as most combat looks more chaotic than it needs to be. With no way to lock onto specific targets in hand-to-hand combat, it can get confusing whom you're attacking. The combat-style, while different, is counter-intuitive to the way gamers are used to enjoying action games. <b>That</b> <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> a whole new style of gameplay for one person, but may be incredibly frustrating for a stubborn old-school gamer like myself." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{father of}} the Old Testament's Joseph is also named Jacob, and W. D.

50|$|Classical Chinese did not {{distinguish}} number {{in some of}} its pronouns, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> 我 wǒ <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> either 'I, me' or 'we, us'.

5000|$|The Domesday Book of 1086 records Gleaston as Glassertun.

He came to us, and we walked along together, and Seppi poured out his gladness like water. It {{was as if he were}} a lover and had found his sweetheart who had been lost. Seppi was a smart and animated boy, and had enthusiasm and expression, and was a contrast to Nikolaus and me. He was full of the last new mystery, now--the disappearance of Hans Oppert, the village loafer. People were beginning to be curious about it, he said. He did not say anxious--curious was the right word, and strong enough. No one had seen Hans for a couple of days.|$|E
