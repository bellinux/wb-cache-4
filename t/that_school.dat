5|$|On March 3, 2011, 0verflow {{acknowledged}} Sekai Project, {{an unofficial}} fan translation group, who had reportedly begun localizing School Days in April 2006. Partnering with American distributor JAST USA, School Days HQ, uncensored in English, was announced for a North American release on March 11, 2011. Development instead continued into 2012, and on May 18, JAST {{announced that the}} company had begun taking pre-orders for the Collector's Edition, a bundled release of the game packaged with a keychain and mousepad. The company announced weeks later on June 1 <b>that</b> <b>School</b> Days HQ had gone gold. Following news on June 26 that the company would exhibit the game at Anime Expo 2012, JAST made an update to the June 1 announcement <b>that</b> <b>School</b> Days HQ had begun shipping.

5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} <b>that</b> <b>school</b> of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of UST, the Faculty of Pharmacy opened its doors to women in the {{academic}} year 1924–1925. It was one of the first universities in the Philippines to become co-educational when it admitted women. There were 24 women enrollees out of the 93 who matriculated for the said Faculty <b>that</b> <b>school</b> year. The University, however, had been granting certificates through the School of Midwifery since 1879. Permission was given to the College of Education in 1926, to Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in 1927 followed by the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery and College of Commerce in 1932. The admission of women no longer became an issue in later years. Only the Faculties of Sacred Theology, Canon Law, and Philosophy remained exclusively for men.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Macartney and {{his family}} moved from Maitland to Sydney. In his school cricketing career Macartney {{distinguished}} himself as an all-rounder at Woollahra Superior and Chatswood public schools, before briefly attending Fort Street High School. Macartney asserted <b>that</b> <b>school</b> cricket was insignificant in his development, believing that he learned more about cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park, with their dog acting as a fielder. It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain Monty Noble, who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Garran {{was made}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the {{establishment}} of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by the naming of the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, and his link with ANU is remembered by the naming of a chair in the university's School of Law, by the naming of the hall of residence Burton & Garran Hall and by the naming of Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with <b>that</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Pennsylvania law {{required}} <b>that</b> <b>school</b> {{students read}} Bible verses {{to start the}} day. The Abington School District added another requirement that the students read the Lord's Prayer. Several Unitarians in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia, objected and held a protest against it. One of them, Ellery Schempp, contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the issue. The ACLU and Schempp's parents believed the school prayer law violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The ACLU's lawyers saw Sawyer as the best choice to argue it, given his skill as a litigator and his success in the Deutch case. Sawyer agreed and filed suit in federal district court.|$|E

However, in Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>school</b> officials violated the Fourth Amendment when they strip searched a 13-year-old girl based only on a student claiming to have received drugs from that student. Similarly, in Samson v. California (2006), the Court ruled that government offices may be searched for evidence of work-related misconduct by government employees on similar grounds. Searches of prison cells are subject to no restraints relating to reasonableness or probable cause.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{was born}} near Easton, Talbot County, Maryland, on May 12, 1824. His parents were Daniel Deady {{and the former}} Mary Ann McSweeny.

In 1828, the family relocated from the Baltimore, Maryland, area to Wheeling Virginia now (West Virginia).

He later worked in the county recorder's office for his brother John Hugh McNary, who had been elected as county recorder in 1890, and for a short time attended the Capital Business College. After leaving <b>that</b> <b>school,</b> he enrolled in college preparatory classes at Willamette University, with an eye towards attending Stanford University or the University of California.
