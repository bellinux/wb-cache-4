Then, it is believed, the Third Temple will be God's temple as Christ reigns on the earth and it will become the Jerusalem, Israel LDS Temple. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> LDS Temples but two main temples will jointly serve as the central governing places – the Jerusalem Temple will function as the resurrected Jesus Christ's Eastern Hemisphere governing place and the New Jerusalem Temple in Independence, Missouri will function as the resurrected Jesus Christ's Western Hemisphere governing place. Both of these two temples will have thrones for Jesus Christ to sit on during his millennial reign.|$|E

John Charles Thomas, representing the National District Attorneys Association, concluded [...] "The pressure is basically {{to err on the}} side of caution, to give the Miranda warning almost every time." [...] Professor Stephen Saltzburg of George Washington University agreed that the ruling would pressure police to adopt a strategy of [...] "When in doubt, give Miranda warnings", but also opined that it would make little practical difference to young people facing police questioning. [...] "The reality is that even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people understand exactly what it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{figure of}} Third, {{seated on the}} highest throne in the hall, {{responds}} that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> good places to live, but also many bad ones. Third states that {{the best place to}} be is Gimlé in the heavens, where a place exists called Okolnir that houses a hall called Brimir—where one can find plenty to drink. Third describes a hall made of red gold located in Niðafjöll called Sindri, where [...] "good and virtuous men will live." [...] Third further relates an unnamed hall in Náströnd, the beaches of the dead, that he describes as a large repugnant hall facing north that is built from the spines of snakes, and resembles [...] "a house with walls woven from branches;" [...] the heads of the snakes face the inside of the house and spew so much venom that rivers of it flow throughout the hall, in which oath breakers and murderers must wade. Third here quotes Völuspá stanzas 38 to 39, with the insertion of original prose stating that the worst place of all to be is in Hvergelmir, followed by a quote from Völuspá to highlight that the dragon Níðhöggr harasses the corpses of the dead there.|$|E

2500|$|A master {{trust is}} a type of SPV {{particularly}} suited to handle revolving credit card balances, and has the flexibility to handle different securities at different times. In a typical master trust transaction, an originator of credit card receivables transfers a pool of those receivables to the trust and then the trust issues securities backed by these receivables. [...] Often <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> tranched securities issued by the trust all based on one set of receivables. [...] After this transaction, typically the originator would continue to service the receivables, in this case the credit cards.|$|E
2500|$|The mixer will process {{not only}} the desired input signal at fRF, but also all signals present at its inputs. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> mixer {{products}} (heterodynes). Most other signals produced by the mixer (such as due to stations at nearby frequencies) can be filtered out in the IF amplifier; that gives the superheterodyne receiver its superior performance. However, if fLO is set to fRF+fIF, then an incoming radio signal at fLO+fIF will also produce a heterodyne at fIF; the frequency [...] fLO+fIF is called the image frequency and must be rejected by the tuned circuits in the RF stage. The image frequency is 2fIF higher (or lower) than the desired frequency fRF, so employing a higher IF frequency fIF increases the receiver's image rejection without requiring additional selectivity in the RF stage.|$|E
50|$|A {{separate}} switch/button {{is provided}} for every signalled route. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> as <b>many</b> switches/buttons per signal {{as there are}} routes (i.e. signalled destinations) from that signal.

2500|$|In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh {{decided to}} travel to Chechnya {{to fight against the}} Russians, but were {{convinced}} by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their passports stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious. After the attacks, a librarian in Hamburg reported that al-Shehhi boasted to her [...] "There will be thousands of dead. You will think of me ...

S. 464 (1982) {{was based on the}} Property Clause of Article IV, §3 and so was not a viable {{precedent}} in this case. Souter noted that the majority expressed their fear that a great many Executive branch actions would be open to lawsuit if they ruled for the Foundation, he said [...] "that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, I fail to see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard." ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> {{different}} eigenvalues [...] {{for which}} a non-zero eigenvector solution exists. Since the entries in the adjacency matrix are non-negative, there is a unique largest eigenvalue, which is real and positive, by the Perron–Frobenius theorem. This greatest eigenvalue results in the desired centrality measure. The [...] component of the related eigenvector then gives the relative centrality score of the vertex [...] in the network. The eigenvector is only defined up to a common factor, so only the ratios of the centralities of the vertices are well defined. To define an absolute score one must normalise the eigen vector e.g. such that the sum over all vertices is 1 or {{the total number of}} vertices n. Power iteration is one of many eigenvalue algorithms that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector. Furthermore, this can be generalized so that the entries in A can be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a stochastic matrix.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert, who {{had given}} the 2007 film three stars, [...] gave the sequel only one, calling it [...] "...a horrible {{experience}} of unbearable length", a phrase which later became {{the title of his}} third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying [...] "If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination." [...] He later wrote on his blog about the film, [...] "The day will come when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>many</b> more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'." [...] Which he later did name it the [...] "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, The A.V. Club gave the film a [...] "C-", complaining about the writing and length, but mentioning the effects and action scenes were impressive. Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil.
