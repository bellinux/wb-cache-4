The Duke himself was arrested on 29 October 1722 under suspicion of involvement in a Jacobite plot, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. His wife, refused permission to visit, prevailed upon the Earl of Carlisle <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>surety</b> for his bail in May 1723.

5000|$|In 1599, {{during the}} Nine Years War, Magrath was taken {{prisoner}} by Con, son of his kinsman Hugh O'Neill, the Earl of Tyrone. The earl ordered Magrath's release {{on the ground}} that only the Holy Father had authority to lay hands on his [...] "friend and ally". Magrath promised that he would return to Catholicism, except that he had to see to his children, and Con released him on conditions: a money payment, with O'Meara's son (related to Magrath's wife) <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>surety</b> in person.|$|E
25|$|In what {{is thought}} to be an archaic {{survival}} in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties</b> or <b>to</b> give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give sureties, and could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties.</b> In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give sureties and could under certain circumstances <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties.</b> This appears <b>to</b> indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of women in this respect.|$|R

The types of food one received as a guest in another's house, or while being cared for due to injury varied based on status. Lower honour-prices limited the ability <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties</b> and <b>as</b> witnesses.

She was sixteen years old when she married the Duke of Norfolk on 26 May 1709. She brought a large dowry of more than £30,000. When her husband was arrested on 29 October 1722 under suspicion of involvement in a Jacobite plot and imprisoned in the Tower of London, the Duchess was not allowed to visit him. She nevertheless managed to convince the Earl of Carlisle <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>surety</b> for his bail in May 1723.|$|E
25|$|Sureties {{were the}} prime enforcers in early Irish law. They were not {{government}} officials, but rather sureties who were appointed {{to enforce a}} contract or other legal relationship. Berad Airechta, the law tract that deals most with sureties, offers formulaic speeches the contractors may have recited ceremonially to appoint sureties and make the sureties swear to perform their duties properly. In addition to sureties appointed for specific contracts, relatives might be expected <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties</b> in cases where they were not specifically bound. However, {{there is also evidence}} that most sureties were either relatives or lords of the contractor.|$|R
5000|$|At {{his third}} {{application}} for release in 2007, Almrei {{was supported by}} two new Members of Parliament who offered <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties</b> and post bail for him, Bill Siksay (C$10,000) and Andrew Telegdi (C$500), while McDonough again reiterated symbolic support ($250) and Trudeau again offered C$5000, while Ralph and Hanson increased their bail offer to C$60,000. Erma Wolfe also offered C$3000 and suggested Almrei could live in the basement apartment attached to her house. And Hindy, the local Imam, gathered C$15,000 from the local Muslim community to contribute. On October 5, Justice Lemieux dismissed the application noting that the proposed bail conditions were [...] "wholly inadequate".|$|R

50|$|Nicola {{brought him}} a very {{substantial}} dowry, but they had considerable difficulty in asserting their rights to her lands at Culmullen in County Meath, the ownership of which was disputed by various relatives of Nicola's first husband. In 1393 Shriggeley and Nicola complained to the Crown {{that they had been}} unlawfully dispossessed of their lands for more than seven years. The dispute apparently turned violent over the following few years, as Shriggeley and one Geoffrey Cusacke (who was probably a nephew of Sir Simon Cusacke) were bound over in 1394-5 to be of good behaviour, to find men of good social standing <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties</b> for their good conduct, and to pledge to do no harm to each other. The Cusacke family continued the struggle to gain possession of Culmullen for at least another generation, long after Shriggeley's death.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of the Bail Act 1978, the bail system in New South Wales relied on rules in different statutes and common law. [...] The Federal Judiciary Act 1903 states that bail will be governed by state laws - there is no federal law for bail. None of the English Acts concerning bail were adopted under the Imperial Acts Adoption Act 1969. Police [...] "almost invariably" [...] required cash in order to grant bail, although a person could also <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a <b>surety</b> on behalf of the person being bailed and provide a sum of money. [...] In the seventies, the amount of cash needed for bail could range from $500 to sums of five figures. In 1969, the Institute for Criminology at Sydney University Law School ran a seminar suggesting improvements to the bail system, resulting in a proposed system similar to the Manhattan Bail Project. Armstrong suggested in 1977 that migrants were over-represented in jail because they did not have friends or family <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>sureties</b> for them.|$|R

50|$|In {{the great}} feud between the clans Maclean and Macdonald {{in the latter}} years of the 16th century (which {{degenerated}} at times into general warfare involving numerous other clans), the Mackinnons were supporters of the former. A temporary settlement was brokered with royal approval in 1587, following the capture of Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean by Angus Macdonald of Dunnyveg. Macdonald agreed to release Maclean {{in exchange for a}} pardon and upon the surrender to him of eight hostages of rank <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> his <b>sureties.</b> Lachlan Mackinnon and his brother Neil were two of the eight hostages, the others being Hector Maclean (Sir Lachlan Maclean’s eldest son), Alexander Macleod (brother of William Macleod of Dunvegan), John and Murdo MacNeil (sons of Ruari Macneil of Barra), Allan Maclean (son of Ewan Maclean of Ardgour) and Donald Maclean (son of Hector Maclean, constable of Cairnburgh Castle).|$|R
5000|$|Khadr's lawyers {{tried to}} have a {{publication}} ban bar media from reporting on the bail hearing held for the suspect. Prosecutor Robin Parker opposed this request, citing the open courts principle. Justice Anne Molloy of Ontario's Superior Court of Justice refused to order the publication ban, and ultimately denied bail. He was represented by Nathan Whitling, Dennis Edney and James Silver. In court Khadr wore a black T-shirt reading [...] "For the Future of Islam." [...] His maternal grandmother Fatmah el-Samnah offered <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> his <b>surety,</b> putting up her $300,000 house as collateral. The motion for bail was opposed by the prosecutor Robin Parker, who referred to United States claims that the forged passport Khadr had purchased in Pakistan was {{to allow him to}} travel to a country without an extradition treaty with the United States. Judge Molloy found there was an unacceptable risk that Khadr would flee, and also that the public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined were she to grant Khadr bail. A second application for bail, brought by Khadr before Justice Gary Trotter, was also refused.|$|R
