5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|In July 1939, Stevens and Colonial Treasurer Alexander Mair {{attempted}} to address Spooner's unwillingness to accede to cabinet decisions regarding ministerial expenditure {{by creating a}} committee of four, consisting of Mair, Stevens, Spooner and Bruxner, to approve all expenditure. Furious at this gesture, Spooner resigned on 21 July 1939 as Minister and Deputy Leader, citing a 'disagreement in government policy on relief works' as the reason. Despite Spooner's departure, {{the stability of the}} government was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short.</b> On 1 August 1939, Spooner carried a motion of no confidence in Stevens in the house, which unexpectedly passed by two votes, owing to the absence of several ministers. On 3 August Stevens tendered his resignation to the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, but was granted several days to remain until his successor was chosen.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, {{there was a lack of}} accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E

5|$|While Mugabe was {{teaching}} abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement {{was established in}} Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. This {{was replaced by the}} more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short,</b> however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.|$|E
5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice {{were joined by}} a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad to worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fighting}} {{had not yet}} spread to the Pacific, by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies {{about the possibility of}} a war with Japan. After a review of the defences around Singapore and Malaya, the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region. In October, the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and supporting elements. As a result, the 2/18th—with a strength of 793 men—subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941, bound for Singapore. The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, so the deployment was only intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short,</b> as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May. Consequently, the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and while they were still in the process of being brought up to full strength.|$|E

5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 1915, Prince of Wales {{was ordered}} to the Dardanelles to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 20 March 1915 and was assigned to the British 5th Squadron of the Allied Fleet off the Dardanelles, where she arrived on 29 March. Prince of Wales supported the landings of the 3rd Brigade, Australian Army, at Gaba Tepe and Anzac Cove on 25 April. Her time at the Dardanelles was destined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> as the Anglo-French-Italian Naval Convention of 10 May required that the British furnish a squadron of four battleships to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. He therefore kept his most modern battleships, plus the British ones, at Taranto to blockade the Austro-Hungarians in the Adriatic Sea.|$|E

However, the XP-39 was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> on performance at altitude.

25|$|During {{the playoffs}} though, this {{optimism}} proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>short</b> lived, because after winning game one 100–94, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped {{the next three}} games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five.

25|$|Vowel {{length is}} not phonemic in Esperanto. Vowels {{tend to be}} long in open {{stressed}} syllables and short otherwise.
