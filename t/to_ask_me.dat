I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> for help.|$|E

The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him I could write one that was better {{and he told me}} to go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it.

He wrote, [...] "If the whole world were <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it." [...] Beauregard was ordered to Charleston and took command of coastal defenses in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, replacing Maj. Gen. John C. Pemberton. The latter was promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to command the defenses of Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|The delays caused Pierre Renoir to {{pull out}} of the film because of prior {{commitments}} to stage plays in Paris. Renoir then asked Michel Simon to play Octave but Simon was busy with other projects. Renoir finally cast himself, later saying that he [...] "was just waiting for the moment when Pierre would say 'Why don't you play the role yourself, Jean?' He didn't have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> twice." [...] He added that after having gained experience and confidence as a director his [...] "most stubborn dream has been to be an actor." [...] Renoir rewrote the role of Octave to better suit himself since he and Pierre were physically and personally very different.|$|E

He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|Hunter {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 CNN/YouTube GOP Debate, and notably, {{received}} {{a question about the}} military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy. The questioner, former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American {{men and women in uniform}} are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter." [...] The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Agnew's first {{marriage}} was to Beverley in 1983; it {{ended in divorce}} in 1992, a year after he became BBC cricket correspondent. He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job. What chance do you have when, be it playing Test cricket or commentating on it, you are away {{for months at a time}} each and every winter?... There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer." [...] Agnew has subsequently remarried: he met Emma Agnew, current editor of BBC East Midlands Today, when they worked together on BBC Radio Leicestershire.|$|E
500|$|With the {{new season}} of the J.League commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about {{assembling}} his squad and backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant. Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought in Franck Durix and his former player Passi. Nagoya finished bottom of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival, and continued their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a row. In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning their desire. To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but creative, training regime. Players were expected to make decisions for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager; Wenger {{was reported to have}} shouted to his players [...] "Don't look at me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> {{what to do with the}} ball!" [...] and [...] "Decide for yourself! Why don't you think it out?" [...] One player who greatly benefited from Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary record improved considerably.|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

500|$|Alberta's women, {{especially}} those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement. [...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd better go home because you're {{not going to get}} any votes from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result to the cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. [...] The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only St. Albert MLA Lucien Boudreau voted against it (though Ribstone Liberal James Gray Turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).|$|E

The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left.

For myself I do not believe that there ever has been any Revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities."
