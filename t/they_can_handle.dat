500|$|The Zarqa {{river is}} highly polluted. In many areas, raw sewage flows {{untreated}} {{directly into the}} river through dry riverbeds (wadis), contaminating it and creating a stench {{which has been a}} cause of numerous complaints, particularly during the summer months. [...] Though sewage treatment stations have been built in a couple of locations (including Ain Ghazal and Khirbet As Samra), these stations often receive more water than <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle.</b> Such overflow occurs during winter floods, as well as during summer months when the population increases with the return of migrant workers to Amman. During overflow, untreated water runs directly to the Zarqa river. As a result, the Zarqa's water is brownish colored, often with dense foam due to large amounts of organic matter. Other sources of pollutants are the illegal dumping of industrial waste, including those from textile factories, and batteries and oils from garages.|$|E

David Patrick Stearns of Philadelphia Daily News {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 4 stars and, also {{referring to the}} success of Music for a Time of War, wrote that the repertoire has [...] "perfectly wide appeal, especially in vital, muscular performances such as these". Stearns, who appreciated Kalmar's balance of technicality and the music's [...] "exterior atmosphere", called the performances [...] "thoughtful" [...] and [...] "incisive". He also noted the originality of the interludes and [...] "Passacaglia" [...] from Peter Grimes, claiming they [...] "won't be mistaken for anybody else's." [...] In his review for The Huffington Post, Brian Horay wrote that the orchestra delivered [...] "knockout" [...] and [...] "beefy-yet-restrained" [...] performances of the Peter Grimes compositions. Referring to This England and its preceding album, which featured Sinfonia da Requiem, Horay said the recordings [...] "showcase Kalmar and his band as supreme interpreters of Benjamin Britten's amazingly colorful brand of orchestral anxiety, inviting the listener to delve ever deeper into painful, yet rewarding, symphonic ambivalence." [...] Classical CD Review's Robert Benson called the Elgar performance [...] "brilliant" [...] and appreciated that [...] "Passacaglia" [...] was programmed before [...] "The Storm". Benson complimented Kalmar (calling him a [...] "conductor to watch") as well as the sound of the recording, describing it as [...] "well-balanced orchestral sound, with a wide dynamic range". He noted the lack of audience interference with the sound and assured audiophiles that they would appreciate the quality. Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote that the Symphony performed [...] "with a brilliance and verve equal to any on record" [...] and were [...] "entirely attuned to the 'English' idiom". Ritter complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for the performances, saying [...] "Who knew Oregon could sound like this? PentaTone should hold on to this bunch as long as they can, and explore as much repertory as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle.</b> Great sound, performances, and production!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Compound-action snips {{are also}} known as {{aviation}} snips because they were developed to cut aluminum {{in the construction of}} aircraft. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> aluminium up to 18 gauge, mild steel up to 24 gauge or stainless steel up to 26 gauge. These type of snips have become the most popular because of the linkage that increases the mechanical advantage without increasing the length of the snips. There are three cutting styles: straight cutting, left cutting, and right cutting. [...] Straight cutting snips (generally have yellow colored soft grips) cut in a straight line and wide curves; left cutting snips (usually red) will cut straight and in a tight curve to the left; right cutting snips (usually green) will cut straight and in a tight curve to the right. These different cutting styles are necessary because metal is stiff and heavy and does not move out of the way readily when cutting around a curve. The respective styles move the material out of the way when cutting in the direction they are designed for. The blades are usually serrated to prevent material slippage.|$|E

Probably the most liberal and intelligent populations of Great Britain are those of Manchester and Birmingham, names which have stood for a hard and sordid industrialism, unrelieved by noble sympathies and impulses.

The Jacobins everywhere set up a cry against the new crusade; and they intrigued with effect in the cabinet, in the field, and in every private society in Europe. Their task was not difficult. The condition of princes, and sometimes of first ministers too, is to be pitied. The creatures of the desk and the creatures of favor had no relish for the principles of the manifestoes. They promised no governments, no regiments, no revenues from whence emoluments might arise by perquisite or by grant. In truth, the tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowest of our species. There is no trade so vile and mechanical as government in their hands. Virtue is not their habit. They are out of themselves in any course of conduct recommended only by conscience and glory. A large, liberal, and prospective view of the interests of states passes with them for romance, and the principles that recommend it for the wanderings of a disordered imagination.
