5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having to follow <b>the</b> <b>assignment</b> editor's {{vision of what}} was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed <b>the</b> <b>assignment</b> editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas <b>the</b> <b>assignment</b> editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

We performed an experiment that showed no significant result which suggests that <b>the</b> <b>assignments</b> did not emphasise the value of best practices.

5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions.

5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. Because {{some of this}} jaw's features {{were thought to be}} incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over <b>the</b> <b>assignment</b> of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|In April 1970, a {{team led}} by Albert Ghiorso working at the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) stepped into the competition.

Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no such activity was found in those reactions.

5|$|The Ayyubids {{had three}} {{principal}} means of recruiting the educated elites whom {{they needed to}} administer their cities and towns. Some of these local leaders, known as shaykhs, entered the service of an Ayyubid ruling household and thus their bids for power were supported from Ayyubid household revenues and influence. Others were paid directly out of revenues made from the diwan, a high governmental body of the state. The third method was assignment to the shaykhs of the revenues of charitable endowments, known as waqfs. The Ayyubids, like their various predecessors in the region, had relatively few state agencies by which they could penetrate their cities and towns. To link themselves with the educated elite of their cities, they relied on the political usage of patronage practices. <b>The</b> <b>assignment</b> of waqf revenue to this elite was similar to <b>the</b> <b>assignment</b> of fiefs (iqta'at) to the commanders and generals of the army. In both cases, it enabled the Ayyubids to recruit a dependent, but not administratively subordinate elite.|$|E
