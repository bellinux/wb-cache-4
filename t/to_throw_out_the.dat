5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

The game provided an historic first: When Dusty Baker and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts exchanged line-up cards before the game, it became the first postseason game in the Major League Baseball history in which two African-American managers faced one another.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, Henry’s German troops forced {{their way}} across the Ponte Milvio and entered Rome, but found it {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Angevin troops from around St Peters Basilica. As the Colonna family had possession of the area around the Basilica of St. John Lateran, Santa Maria Maggiore and the Colosseum, Henry was forced to perform his coronation on 29 June 1312 at the Lateran. The ceremony was performed by three Ghibelline cardinals who had joined Henry on his way through Italy. Robert of Naples, in the meantime, had made increasing demands upon Henry, including Henry making Robert’s son the Imperial vicar of Tuscany, and that Henry had to depart Rome within four days of his coronation. Henry, in his turn, declared that the imperial prerogative overrode papal authority, and that the entirety of Italy was subject to the emperor. He then refused to commit, as Pope Clement V had requested, to seek a truce with Robert of Naples, and he didn’t rule out attacking the southern kingdom. After Henry concluded a formal treaty signed with Robert's rival to the Sicilian throne, Frederick of Aragon, the chaos in the city of Rome forced Henry to leave, and, following the advice of Tuscan Ghibellines, he travelled north to Arezzo.|$|E

For some the game carried an historic weight that would either confirm or change the narrative of the Nationals, their achievements, and their prospects for the future after their collapse in the 2012 NLDS and the impotence of their offense in the 2014 NLDS. A Washington, D.C., MLB team had not won a postseason series since the Washington Senators won the 1924 World Series, the Montreal-Washington franchise had won only one playoff series in its history (in 1981, as the Montreal Expos), and the Nationals had never advanced beyond the NLDS in two previous tries. Two personal negative streaks also were on the line: Teams Dusty Baker managed had lost eight straight postseason elimination games in a row in which they had a chance to advance to the next round of the playoffs, and starting pitcher Max Scherzer had started three postseason elimination games in a row for his previous teams, all of them losses.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{critical}} and commercial success of Cinderella, writing for Sleeping Beauty began in early 1951. Partial story elements originated from discarded ideas for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs including Maleficent's capture of Prince Philip and his dramatic escape from her fortress and Cinderella where a fantasy sequence featured the leading protagonists dancing on a cloud which was developed, but eventually {{dropped from the}} film. By the middle of 1953, director Wilfred Jackson had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were {{to meet in the}} forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date. For a number of months, Jackson, Ted Sears, and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the wake-up kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.|$|E

[...] Teams began taking advantage of his defensive increased weakness. [...] Once possessing great ability <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lead runner at third base ahead on bunt plays, Bagwell {{found it difficult to}} practice with the other infielders between innings.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz was {{assigned}} writing duties for [...] "Nisei", which was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology story and to air as the seventh episode of the third season. However, as Spotnitz developed his script, the episode hit several logistical snags. Most notably, Spotnitz's script featured several scenes filmed on trains: Chris Carter explained, [...] "We found {{that we were going to}} have some trouble shooting with trains." [...] Eventually, the sheer scope of the episode caused co-executive producer R. W. Goodwin so much trouble that he wanted to scrap the story. Spotnitz explained, [...] "Goodwin called Chris and said, 'This is unproducable. [...] you've got <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> script, basically.' I was devastated, and Chris [...] 'Let's make it a two-parter.'" [...] So, the episode was bumped back to number nine and was lengthened to a two parter, resulting in it being delayed several weeks.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 1909, McAleer went on {{to manage}} the Washington Senators (popularly known as the [...] "Nationals"), a team that had ceased to be {{competitive}} {{since the death of}} star hitter Ed Delahanty six years earlier. The team fared little better under McAleer's management, finishing with a lackluster 66–85 record (seventh place) {{at the close of the}} 1910 season. The high point of the season was a game in which McAleer initiated what became a baseball tradition. On April 14, 1910, he asked visiting President William Howard Taft <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> first ball of a season opener. President Taft, an ardent fan of the game, readily agreed. Baseball historians Donald Dewey and Nicholas Acocella noted that the game [...] "almost put an end to the career" [...] of U.S. Vice President James S. Sherman, who [...] "took a foul ball off the bat of Frank Baker directly in the head". This contest also featured a one-hit performance by pitcher Walter Johnson, who led the Senators to a 3–0 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics.|$|E
500|$|The [...] season saw Warhop post a 12–13 record, a 4.16 ERA and 15 hit batsmen (the third {{highest in}} the league). [...] His starts {{throughout}} the season were mixed; some were poor or marred by bad luck. [...] He was shelled on May 9 in a 10–0 loss against a Detroit Tigers lineup featuring Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty, giving up runs {{in each of the}} first four innings. [...] However, he improved a few weeks later on May 20, when he limited the St. Louis Browns to four hits. [...] This began a quality stretch for Warhop, who won five consecutive games by July 17—a result of an improvement in his control. [...] Then, during an August 21 road game against the Tigers, he lost a 5–4 walk-off game in the eleventh inning, in part due to his own unsuccessful strategy in fielding two bunts. [...] On both occasions, he threw to second base but was too late, and the baserunners were able to advance safely and load the bases. [...] The Highlanders lost when Earle Gardner booted a routine ground ball by Bill Donovan in an rushed attempt <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> go-ahead runner at home plate. [...] His desperation culminated in him unsuccessfully requesting the league {{at the end of the}} season to change his win–loss record to 14–11, under the mistaken belief that his 12–13 record was incorrect.|$|E
500|$|In November 2010, Axl Rose sued Activision for $20 {{million for}} misuse of Guns N' Roses music and its musicians (specifically Slash) in Guitar Hero III. In the lawsuit, Rose claims {{that when he}} learned that a Slash-like {{character}} and other Velvet Revolver songs would be included in Guitar Hero II, he refused to allow Activision to use [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] within Guitar Hero III, nor promotional images of Slash that had already been created. According to Rose's claims, Activision stated that these would only be used as promotional material for a trade show, but ended up using them within the game. Furthermore, Rose asserts that Activision had used [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine", which was only licensed for use on Guitar Hero II, was used for promotional material within Guitar Hero III. The judge in the case has allowed the trial to move forward after an initial hearing in March 2011. A jury trial was expected to start in May 2012. At initial hearings in August 2012, the judge dismissed a fraud claim made by Rose, considering that it took three years for Rose and his publisher Black Frog Music to file these claims after the release of the game, an excessively long time for such a claim. The judge maintained the likelihood of the breach of contract argument, setting a jury trial to likely occur in early 2013. In January and February 2013, the judge dismissed the case, indicated that the lateness of the filing of the lawsuit, about three years since the release of the game, gave him grounds <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> suit, though Rose stated that the delay was due to promises made by Activision for a Guns N' Roses-themed game as compensation for the violation of contract terms.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} of three segments, the Simpsons visit Morocco (which Homer {{mistakes}} for Monaco). Homer purchases a severed monkey's hand that will grant four wishes, despite the vendor's warning that the wisher will experience grave misfortune. Back in Springfield, the family argues in how to use the wishes. Despite Marge's warning to heed the advice of the vendor in not using any of them, Maggie is granted that first wish: a new pacifier. Next, Bart wishes for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. His wish is granted, but the people immediately tire of the family's annoying antics, cheesy merchandise and celebrity treatment. Horrified by these wasteful wishes, Lisa wishes for world peace and Homer is furious. While all countries declare peace and destroy their weapons, the aliens Kang and Kodos realize the human race is [...] "ripe for the plucking" [...] and, armed with only a slingshot and a club, enslave the Earth. At the house, Homer blames Lisa and deems her own wishes to be selfish. She defends herself, claiming that Bart and Maggie's own wishes were also selfish as well and felt that hers was the only selfless one. Soon, Marge catches the people who are angry with the Simpsons and calls for a temporary truce in the family. Determined to make a wish that could not be twisted, she begs Homer {{to do the right thing}} and use the last wish to get rid of the aliens. Much to her dismay, Homer refuses and demands a turkey sandwich, but the turkey turns out to be a little too dry. With all the wishes used up, he goes <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> paw, but his neighbor Ned asks about it. Hoping to see Flanders suffer, Homer gladly hands the paw over. Ned's first wish is to [...] "Get rid of those awful aliens," [...] which is accomplished when Moe chases after Kodos with a board with a nail sticking out of it, then brings the aliens back to the flying saucer. Kodos laments their failed invasion, but Kang assures him that humanity is doomed: [...] they will end up in an arms race creating increasingly larger boards and larger nails, which will ultimately [...] "cause the human race to create a board with a nail in it so big to doom mankind." [...] Everyone celebrates and after Flanders wishes to [...] "spruce up the ol' homestead," [...] his house is converted into an opulent castle, making Homer envious. Lisa wakes up from her nightmare and begs Bart to keep her company. Bart sleepily complies after Lisa gives him a candy necklace. Bart then has a nightmare.|$|E
