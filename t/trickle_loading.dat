2500|$|In November 1963, British Eagle {{launched}} daily {{scheduled services}} between London Heathrow and Glasgow Renfrew with 103-seater, two-class Britannias. The inaugural London—Glasgow service — operated by ex-BOAC Britannia 310 Enterprise — {{was followed by}} daily two-class Britannia services from Heathrow to Edinburgh and Belfast the next day.

It was also the first time a scheduled airline had offered a separate first class cabin on a UK domestic route. As British Eagle was restricted to a single daily round-trip on each route, it sought to differentiate itself from BEA. While BEA served these routes with 132-seat Vickers Vanguards in an all-tourist configuration with minimal onboard catering, British Eagle provided full catering on all flights. This included top-quality wines as well as the use of Wedgwood china and fine-quality glassware in first class. British Eagle differentiated itself by introducing assigned seating and [...] "trickle loading". The former was a first for a UK scheduled domestic carrier while the airline claimed to have started the latter in the UK as well. Although British Eagle provided a standby aircraft to maintain the integrity of its schedules, flights were timed to provide eight-hours' work per day for one aircraft to maximise utilisation. BEA, whose frequencies were not restricted, responded to the challenge on its three most important domestic routes by scheduling additional flights that departed and arrived at the same time or within 10 minutes of its rival's scheduled departure and arrival times. This had the effect of [...] "sandwiching" [...] British Eagle's flights.

The reactor performance is simulated by a model {{taking into account the}} gas-liquid phase equilibrium. The gas oil compounds as well as the sulphur bearing compounds are represented by five pseudo-components. The sulphur removal and the hydrogen consumption are described by a set of parallel reactions of first order with respect to each pseudo-compound concentration. The reactants present in the liquid phase are considered to participate in catalytic reactions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{transferred}} from the liquid phase into a biofilm {{can be used for}} aerobic degradation of organic matter and for nitrification. A second possible pathway for the removal of organic matter is denitrification in anoxic zones deeper in the biofilm. At high organic loading rates with insufficient oxygen supply to the biofilm, denitrification could be induced by providing the biofilm with external nitrate. This possibility was tested in a pilotscale trickling filter by adding a pulse of nitrate to a highly <b>loaded</b> <b>trickling</b> filter. The experiment showed that denitrification can indeed be induced by adding nitrate at high loading conditions and that this way a considerably increased substrate removal capacity can be obtained. The fact that denitrification occurred was confirmed by the increased production of CO 2 from bioconversion processes, without major change of the O 2 consumption. The simplified mixed-culture biofilm model developed by Rauch et al. (1999) was extended for the description of off-gas measurements and was able to describe the results of the experiment very well...|$|R
40|$|Increases in herd {{size and}} {{enforcement}} of water quality regulations have created an effluent disposal problem for the New Zealand dairy industry. Spray disposal to land and lagooning are commonly used but mechanical failures, management requirements and pressure on land have limited their suitability in many situations. This project was established to consider an alternative system. Initial studies revealed that anaerobic treatment in unmixed, non-insulated tanks, followed by trickling filter aeration, might be suitable. Two laboratory scale and one field treatment plant (1 / 15 - 1 / 20 full scale) were constructed to investigate the system. A factorial experimental design allowed investigation into three anaerobic treatment levels with a 3 x 3 aerobic treatment interaction nested within each anaerobic treatment. Anaerobic residence times of 5, 7. 5 and 10 days provided loading rates of 1. 35 - 0. 63 kg COD/m 3 -day and 1. 36 - 0. 67 kg T S/m 3 -day. Removals between inlet and outlet averaged 71 % and were insensitive to loading rate. Total solids accumulation rates of 40 - 50 % TS input rate suggests that anaerobic tank design {{should be based on}} solids accumulation rate and cleaning frequency. The stone media <b>trickling</b> filter was <b>loaded</b> at approximately 0. 61 kg COD/m 3 -day. Aeration periods of 1, 2 and 3 days and hydraulic loads of 2. 8, 10. 1 and 18. 2 m 3 /m 2 -day were studied to determine their influence on treatment efficiency. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the longer residence times and higher recycle rates improved treatment efficiency. Removals varied with the measured parameters but ranged from 42 - 66 % for COD. Design alterations to allow the final discharge to be taken {{from the bottom of the}} filter, after settling, would increase aerobic treatment efficiency above 75 % COD removal. Prediction of treatment efficiencies beyond the monitored operating conditions suggested that only marginal improvements could be made. The TS accumulation rate in the aerobic phase was approximately 13 % of the TS input rate or 56 % of the BOD removal rate. Overall plant treatment efficiencies of 80 - 89 % were obtained. Removals in excess of 92 % could be achieved with minor design alterations. Maintenance and operational requirements were minimal. The only problem with the system was an average 15 fold increase in NO 3 -N and 4 fold increase in DIP under conditions for optimum removal of the other parameters. Intermittent land disposal could reduce this problem. Treatment comparison between similar laboratory plants, and between laboratory and field plants which varied by a scale factor of 56, suggests that identically designed plants would give a similar performance and that there is little scale effect. Increasing the scale only improved treatment efficiencies under unstable aerobic conditions, i. e., high recycle rates and low residence times. Increasing scale gave some decrease in maintenance and operational problems. Design of a full scale plant, based on daily pollution loads from a 250 cow dairy shed, suggests that the system is a viable proposition...|$|R
