50|$|Mad Dog Knives makes {{tactical}} fixed-blade knives, originally using Starrett 496-O1 {{high carbon}} tool steel and later switching to Precision Marshall Presco American Made 01, which {{is given a}} proprietary heat treatment. This process includes hardening, stress relieving, and selectively tempering the blade. As a result, the blades have an edge hardness of 62-63 on the Rockwell C scale whereas the tip, spine, and tang have a Rockwell hardness of 50-54. This heat treatment was devised to develop phenomenal edge retention while preventing <b>tip</b> <b>breakage</b> and maintaining a degree of flexibility on the softer spine to improve the toughness of the knife. The blades are coated {{with a layer of}} hard chrome as a method of abrasion and corrosion resistance.|$|E
50|$|TCT core drills {{are made}} from Tungsten Carbide {{material}} on their tips. Tungsten carbide is a very hard material and supposed {{to be one of}} the hardest materials made by man. TCT core drills are more expensive then HSS core drills but are faster and easy to make bigger holes. There are also different types in TCT core drills. TCT core drills are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. They are very efficient for cutting hard material. The chances of <b>tip</b> <b>breakage</b> in TCT core drill is more compared to HSS Core drills. TCT core drills has a disadvantage that it can not be reground. Once the TCT core drill is damaged it has to be thrown away, it can not be re used like the HSS core drills. It is always recommended by manufacturers to use TCT core drills only for larger diameter and for very hard material, while giving priority to HSS core drills because of its price and re-sharpening advantages.|$|E
40|$|Device {{mechanically}} stabilizes buttons {{from which}} silicon ribbons grown by dendritic-web process. Eliminates tendency for button to tip and interrupt pull because of asymmetry. Silicon seed hangs from holder through stabilizing tube. While button growing, tube elevated above melt surface. When ready for pulling of ribbon, tube comes {{to rest on}} button and prevents tipping. Large button used. Even if button assumes highly-asymmetrical weight distrubtion in early stages of growth, little danger of <b>tipping</b> and <b>breakage</b> of nascent ribbon...|$|R
40|$|Scarf joints {{with small}} scarf angles are {{especially}} sensitive to stiffness mismatch between adherends and to adherend <b>tip</b> bluntness. Pre-assembly <b>breakage</b> of an adherend tip {{where it is}} only a few microns thick can cause significant reduction in joint strength. Mathematically, the reason for such sensitivity is that the solutions to the governing differential equation develop boundary layer character when the scarf angles are small. The boundary layers are regions with large adhesive stresses. Experimental strength data for laminated composite adherends agree with the results of this analysis...|$|R
40|$|Spines of {{sea urchins}} are {{appendages}} {{that are associated}} with defense, locomotion, and food gathering. Spines are repaired when damaged, and the dynamics of repair was studied in the slate-pencil sea urchin Heterocentrotus mammillatus to provide insights not only into the processes of healing. but also into the normal growth of spines and the formation of growth lines. Regeneration of spines on tubercles following complete removal of a spine was slow and depended upon the size of the original spine. The maximum amount of regeneration occurred on tubercles with spines of intermediate size (1. 6 g), which, on average, developed regenerated spines weighing 0. 1, 0. 3, and 0. 7 g after 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. Some large tubercles, which had original spines weighing over 3 g, failed to develop a new spine even after 8 - 12 months. Regeneration of a new tip on a cut stump was more rapid than production of a new spine on a tubercle. Regeneration to original size was more rapid for small spines than for large spines, but large stumps produced more calcite per unit time. In 4 months, a small spine with a removed tip weighing 0. 15 g regenerated a new tip weighing 0. 09 g, or 63 % of its original weight. In the same time, a large spine with 2. 35 g of tip removed regenerated 0. 40 g of new tip, or 17 % of the original weight. Holes were drilled in spines to serve as bench marks to document the production of new growth lines in response to damage. Blind holes drilled in spines caused 65 % loss over 4 months, but holes drilled completely through spines caused only a 6 % loss. Cutting a spine near its base did not initiate shedding of the stump. Repair of holes drilled in spines showed that major repair originated from the spine surface, and regeneration into the hole was over obtuse angles. For a slanting hole through a spine, filling of the hole carne from the distal edge for the distal opening and from the proximal edge for the proximal opening. Spines were tagged with tetracycline, but of 46 spines examined 4 - 12 months following treatment, only 1 displayed evidence that the spine surface had been marked. This suggests that spines usually are not growing. Abrasion of spines either by wiping with a cloth or sanding with emery paper failed to induce growth lines to form. Of 57 abraded spines and 64 unabraded spines, only 2 in each treatment category developed new growth lines. Results show that some growth lines in spines develop from trauma, but these tend to be local and do not extend from the base to the tip. Spines of Heterocentrotus mammillatus usually are not growing but occasionally undergo a growth episode that produces a growth line that extends from the milled ring to the spine tip. Such an episode is not related to damage repair from abrasion or breakage and appears to be endogenous. The SPINES OF A SEA URCHIN are morphological parts that serve as the animal's first defense against assaults from the environment (e. g., Fricke 1974, Strathmann 1981), appendages for gathering and manipulating food (e. g., Ebert 1968, Leighton 1968), and braces for wedging into crevices (e. g., Regis and Thomassin 1982). Spines form an important part of an urchin's maintenance mechanisms (Ebert 1982), and it is no surprise to find that they are repaired rapidly once damaged (Ebert 1967, Heat field 1971, Mischor 1975). Spine sizes vary greatly across taxa. For example, in St rongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson 1857), calcite of a large primary spine weighs only about 0. 03 g. In slate-pencil sea urchins of the genus Heterocentrotus, spines are substantially more massive. Calcite in a large H. mammillatus (Linneaus 1758) spine may weigh over 5 g, and calcite of a large primary spine of H. trigonarius (Lamarck 1816) may weigh over 11 g. Although spines from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus would be expected to be repaired rapidly (Ebert 1967, Heatfield 1971), it is less clear whether very large spines from Heterocentrotus species also would be repaired in just a few months or whether the benefits of large spines carry a potential burden of a long regeneration time. A second issue associated with damage repair focuses on growth lines in spines. In St rongylocentrotus purpuratus, lines form as a consequence of <b>tip</b> regeneration following <b>breakage</b> (Ebert 1967, Heatfield 1971), but growth lines in Heterocentrotus spp. have been interpreted as periodic (Dotan and Fishelson 1985, Weber 1969), an interpretation that has been disputed (Ebert 1985, 1987). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present results of a 1 -year study on Heterocentrotus mammillatus (family Echinometridae), a species with massive spines. The focus is on the responses of spines to damage, spine repair and regeneration in response to trauma, and the formation of growth lines. Data are presented on (a) regeneration following total removal of spines; (b) repair rates of calcite on cut spine stubs; (c) responses of spines to small holes drilled into or through them; (d) responses of spines to abrasion; and (e) results of tagging spines with tetracycline...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vertical vein is left patent in {{some cases}} of supra-cardiac total {{anomalous}} pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) when there is hemodynamic instability due to noncompliant left atrium and ventricle. After the peri-operative period, this results in features of pre-tricuspid shunt. Materials and Methods: Three cases with patent vertical vein following repair of supra-cardiac TAPVC presented with features of pre-tricuspid shunt on follow-up. Trans-catheter closure of patent vertical vein was performed using vascular plug in all three subjects. Results: The procedure was technically successful in all the patients. There was a complication related to catheter <b>tip</b> <b>breakage</b> in one of them, which was successfully managed. There was no impingement on pulmonary vein {{in any of the}} patients. Conclusion: Patent vertical vein following TAPVC repair results in features of pre-tricuspid shunt. Transcatheter closure of the patent vein is feasible...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Impulsive {{sound and}} {{vibration}} signals in gear system are {{often associated with}} their faults. Thus these impulsive sound and vibration signals {{can be used as}} indicators in condition monitoring of gear system. The traditional continuous wavelet transform has been used for detection of impulsive signals. However, it is often difficult for the continuous wavelet transform to identify spikes at high frequency and meshing frequencies at low frequency simultaneously since the continuous wavelet transform is to apply the linear scaling (a-dilation) to the mother wavelet. In this paper, the spike wavelet transform is developed to extract these impulsive sound and vibration signals. Since the spike wavelet transform is to apply the non-linear scaling, it has better time resolution at high frequency and frequency resolution at low frequency than that of the continuous wavelet transform respectively. The spike wavelet transform can be, therefore, used to detect fault position clearly without the loss of information for the damage of a gear system. The spike wavelet transform is successfully is applied to detection of the gear fault with <b>tip</b> <b>breakage...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{demand for}} {{increased}} computing power {{and more complex}} integrated circuit devices with increased functions per chip results in high lead-count integrated circuit packages. With the shrinkage in integrated circuit sizes towards smaller packages, and the decrease in pad pitch, the trend is moving from the current ultra-fine-pitch volume production of 50 µm to even lower pad pitches. However, the various concerns for 50 -µm pitch bonding, such as low production yield, reliability issues, etc, have forced many customers to re-visit the feasibility of utilising the robust fine pitch bonding to handle the high lead-count packages. This paper reports the new development of bonding tools to handle the multi-tier wire bonding requirement with a maximum loop height of 475 µm. With {{the increase in the}} loop height of the wires, the bottleneck height of the capillary needs to be increased accordingly to prevent touching the adjacent wire during bonding. The increase in bottleneck height can influence the efficient transfer of the ultrasonic energy from the bonding tool to the bond interface and affect bond quality. In addition, the longer bottleneck height of the capillary also increases the risk of <b>tip</b> <b>breakage</b> during bonding. In this study, the external profile of the capillary is simulated with respect to the looping profile during bonding using a customised software package. In addition, finite element simulation is also utilised to analyse the difference in stress level with different bonding tool designs. The results of the simulations are then used to correlate with the actual bonding responses...|$|E
