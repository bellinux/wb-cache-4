50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cornells</b> were a 1960s Los Angeles {{band that}} played mostly surf music. Four {{of the five}} members had a parent that was a well known celebrity.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, McDaniel became {{director}} of LNS and served until {{he retired from}} <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> faculty in 1985. He research included important measurements {{with each of the}} series of LNS accelerators, including studies lambda-meson photo production, K-meson production, and measurements of the neutron electromagnetic form factors.|$|E
5|$|Cornell {{named the}} third of five new {{residential}} colleges, {{each of which is}} named after a distinguished former member of <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> faculty, Hans Bethe House after him, as was the Hans Bethe Center, 322 4th St. NE, Washington, DC, home to the Council for a Livable World, where Bethe was a longtime board member, and the Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics at University of Bonn in Germany. He also has an asteroid, 30828 Bethe, that was discovered in 1990 named after him, as was the American Physical Society's Hans Bethe Prize.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to monitor the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill, led by Vassar College's Environmental Research Institute and <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> University Cooperative Extension Dutchess County Environment Program. Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. Benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run.|$|E

5000|$|In 1873, he was {{appointed}} founding dean of the Civil Engineering Department of Cornell, and from 1890 to 1902 directed <b>the</b> <b>Cornell's</b> College of Civil Engineering advancing its research and technical programs to its then [...] "state-of-the-art" [...] modern standard.|$|R
25|$|The {{statutory}} colleges at Cornell {{grew out}} of Cornell's designation in 1865 as New York State's land grant college under the Morrill Act. Under <b>the</b> Morrill Act, <b>Cornell</b> received land scrip based on {{the population of the}} state, and the proceeds formed <b>the</b> basis of <b>Cornell's</b> initial endowment. Under the terms of <b>the</b> <b>Cornell's</b> 1865 charter from <b>the</b> Legislature, <b>Cornell</b> was obligated to teach agriculture, mechanical arts and military tactic. (Cornell was also obligated to provide free tuition to students from each assembly district.) By <b>the</b> 1890s, <b>Cornell</b> sought state funding to continue its mission in these areas, and the statutory colleges were formed as a vehicle for direct state funding. In addition, around the start of the 20th century, new federal laws provided land-grant colleges (and their agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension services) with annual funding conditioned upon matching state funds. As a result, almost all of Cornell's land grant duties were transferred to its four statutory colleges, which receive such state funds through the present.|$|R
5|$|George McTurnan Kahin (January 25, 1918 – January 29, 2000) was an American {{historian}} and political scientist. He {{was one of}} the leading experts on Southeast Asia and a critic of United States involvement in the Vietnam War. After completing his dissertation, which is still considered a classic on Indonesian history, Kahin became a faculty member at Cornell University. At Cornell, he became the director of its Southeast Asia Program and founded <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> Modern Indonesia Project. Kahin's incomplete memoir was published posthumously in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, William Payne Whitney's $27 million {{donation}} led to {{the building}} of the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, which became the name for Weill Cornell's large psychiatric effort. That same year, the college became affiliated with New York Hospital and the two institutions moved to their current joint campus in 1932. The hospital's Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> Nursing School until it closed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} In the Land of Lady White Blood: Southern Thailand and the Meaning of History, Lorraine Gesick {{discussed}} a manuscript from Wat Pha Kho in Sathing Phra. The manuscript (which in Gesick's opinion {{dates from the}} late 17th century) consists mainly of an illustrated map about ten metres long that depicts Sultan Sulaiman's forts at Khao Daeng. A microfilm of this manuscript, made by American historian David Wyatt, is kept at <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> University Library.|$|E

5|$|While the Jacksonville chain kept expanding, {{two friends}} named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton, both alumni of <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> University School of Hotel Administration, were seeking an {{opportunity}} to open their own business. McLamore had visited the original hamburger stand belonging to Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino, California, and sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, decided to open a similar operation.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{initiated}} {{the construction of}} a 1.4 GeV synchrotron in 1952. As he had foreseen in 1948, it produced artificial K mesons and rho mesons, and tested quantum electrodynamics at short distances. The last machine he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> Electron Storage Ring (CESR), built between 1977 and 1999. It is located in what is now known as the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{suffered}} a stroke in 1999, from which he never recovered. He died on January 16, 2000, {{at the age of}} 85, at a nursing home in Ithaca, New York, and was buried at the 19th-century Pioneer Cemetery on the Fermilab site. He was survived by his wife, Jane; his three sons, Daniel, Jonathan and Rand; and his sister, Mary Jane Greenhill. His papers are in <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> University Library.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Sanders {{took over}} the lease of the Pure Oil filling station {{on the other side}} of the road, due to its greater {{visibility}} for motorists. He then began to sell fried chicken. To improve his skills, Sanders took an eight-week restaurant-management course at <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> University School of Hotel Administration. By 1936, his business had proved successful enough for him to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937, Sanders expanded his restaurant to 140 seats, and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street, the Sanders Court & Café.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Kahin {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor of government at Cornell University. He received tenure and was promoted to associate professor in 1954; he became a full professor in 1959. He became the director of Cornell's Southeast Asia Program in 1961 and held the position until 1970. Kahin also founded <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> Modern Indonesia Project in 1954 and served as its director until his retirement in 1988. Between 1962 and 1963, he became a Fulbright professor at London University. Kahin {{was a member of the}} Council on Foreign Relations and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Cornell University Medical College's {{affiliate}} hospital, New York Hospital, {{merged with}} Presbyterian Hospital (the affiliate hospital for Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons). The combined institution operates today as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Despite the clinical alliance, {{the faculty and}} instructional functions of <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> and Columbia units remain distinct and independent. Multiple fellowships and clinical programs have merged, however, and the institutions are continuing {{in their efforts to}} bring together departments, which could enhance academic efforts, reduce costs, and increase public recognition. All hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System are affiliated with one of the two colleges.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly granivorous, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|In September 1896, Cornell’s {{president}} Jacob Gould Schurman prevailed {{upon the}} Board of Trustees to extend {{an offer to}} Nathaniel Schmidt. The situation at Colgate’s Divinity School had deteriorated. Schmidt’s unorthodox theology generated discomfort within that college. From 1886 {{to the arrival of}} Professor Nathaniel Schmidt in 1896, Cornell’s Library maintained its support for the acquisition of Near Eastern materials. Taking over as Cornell President, Jacob Gould Schurman decided Cornell needed a chair of Hebrew language. In 1896, Schurman persuaded Henry W. Sage to finance a professor of Semitic Languages and Literatures for AY1896-97 and AY 1897-98. He knew the University could secure Schmidt at a bargain. Schmidt’s unorthodox theological views made his stay at Colgate Divinity School untenable. Schmidt gained the respect of <b>the</b> <b>Cornell</b> community. Noted for his personal and scholarly integrity, he was soon shielded by sympathetic administrators. Schmidt served Cornell for thirty-six years, carrying a high teaching load in addition to this extensive research. He taught an elementary course in Hebrew each year. Advanced Hebrew covered the leading writers of the Old Testament and some parts of the Mishnaic and other Talmudic literature in three years. General linguistics students were advised to begin their study of Semitic languages with Arabic, also offered each year. Aramaic and Egyptian alternated with Assyrian and Ethiopic. The Semitic Seminary, given one term each year, was dedicated to epigraphical studies.|$|E
