5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} {{that they had}} decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be no more}} tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E
5|$|The three {{language}} formula was {{not strictly}} enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession {{to the south}} was <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort {{to follow through with}} that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time.|$|E

He was accompanied by Michoacan's governor Leonel Godoy to survey the damage. As an alternative to mining, Calderón suggested developing tourism in Angangueo as a Pueblo Mágico. However, residents demanded <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the town would not disappear, and that jobs would be available.|$|E
25|$|During the Lavender Scare, Cohn and McCarthy further {{enhanced}} anti-Communist fervor {{by suggesting}} that Communists overseas had convinced several closeted homosexuals within the U.S. government to leak important government information in exchange for <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> their sexual identity would remain a secret. A federal investigation that followed convinced President Dwight D. Eisenhower to sign an Executive Order on 29April 1953, that barred homosexuals from obtaining jobs at the federal level.|$|E

The book includes a summary of the entire Bhagvata, a standard description of the ten characteristics of a Purana that is found in every Puranic text, three chapters about the life of Markandeya, and <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> it is the greatest among puranas.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Cabinet wives {{insisted that}} the {{interests}} and honor of all American women was at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian Daniel Walker Howe notes {{that this was the}} feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.|$|E
25|$|In April 1795, Prince Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł and {{his wife}} {{traveled}} to Berlin with their daughter Christina and son Antoni; on 1 May, they were presented at the royal court at Bellevue Palace. The Radziwiłłs were a Polish Catholic family {{that belonged to the}} oldest and most renowned of dynasties in Poland, and were also in possession of much wealth. They were great favorites with Louise's parents, and frequently dined at their home. As time went by, Louise and Antoni began to desire to marry. While many of her family members were in favor of such a match, her mother, never close with Louise, disapproved. Her parents eventually gave their full consent on <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> she would live near them during her marriage.|$|E

The band's final show before their break was on September 25, 2013. As of March 2014, they began playing shows again, though not as part of an official tour.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} State Department message {{stressed the}} need to publicly emphasize {{the fact that the}} coup was an expression of national will by citing the near unanimous support of key military and civilian leaders. The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ in a quick return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an interim regime. Lodge replied affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed quietly to avoid the appearance that it was a payoff for the coup.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, North Korea and the United States {{signed an}} Agreed Framework which was {{designed}} to freeze and eventually dismantle the North's nuclear weapons program in exchange for aid in producing two power-generating nuclear reactors and <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> it won't be invaded again. In 2000, after a meeting with Madeleine Albright, he agreed to a moratorium on missile construction. In 2002, Kim Jong-il's government admitted to having produced nuclear weapons since the 1994 agreement. Kim's regime argued the secret production was necessary for security purposesciting the presence of United States-owned nuclear weapons in South Korea and the new tensions with the United States under President George W. Bush. On 9 October 2006, North Korea's Korean Central News Agency announced that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, CDF {{which had}} {{increased}} in size during the war began demobilisation.In 1948 Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain, becoming a Dominion within the commonwealth and a year earlier Ceylon entered into the bi-lateral Anglo-Ceylonese Defence Agreement of 1947. This followed by the Army Act No. 17 of 1949 which was passed by Parliament on April 11, 1949 and formalised in Gazette Extraordinary No. 10028 of October 10, 1949 marked {{the creation of the}} Ceylon Army, consisting of a regular and a volunteer force, the later being the successor of the disbanded CDF. Therefor October 10, 1949 is considered the Ceylon Army was raised, and October 10 is celebrated annually as Army day. The Defence Agreement of 1947 provided <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> British would {{come to the aid of}} Ceylon in the event it was attacked by a foreign power and provided British military advisers to build up the country's military. Brigadier James Sinclair, Earl of Caithness was appointed as general officer commanding Ceylon Army, as such becoming the first commander of the Ceylon Army.|$|E
25|$|Before the offensive, Falkenhayn had {{expected}} that French artillery {{on the west}} bank would be suppressed by counter-battery fire but this had failed. The Germans set up a specialist artillery force to counter French artillery-fire from the west bank but this also failed to reduce German infantry casualties. The 5th Army asked for more troops in late February but Falkenhayn refused, due to the rapid advance already achieved on the east bank and because he needed the rest of the OHL reserve for an offensive elsewhere, once the attack at Verdun had attracted and consumed French reserves. The pause in the German advance on 27 February led Falkenhayn to have second thoughts to decide between terminating the offensive or reinforcing it. On 29 February, Knobelsdorf, the 5th Army Chief of Staff, prised two divisions from the OHL reserve, with <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> once the heights {{on the west bank}} had been occupied, the offensive on the east bank could be completed. The VI Reserve Corps was reinforced with the X Reserve Corps, to capture a line from the south of Avocourt to Côte 304 north of Esnes, Mort-Homme, Bois des Cumières and Côte 205, from which the French artillery on the west bank could be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The {{hunger and}} despair {{of the market}} women was the {{original}} impetus for the march, but {{what started as a}} search for bread soon took on a much more ambitious goal. The Hôtel de Ville had already opened its plentiful stores to the rioters, but they remained unsatisfied: they wanted not just one meal but <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> bread would once again be plentiful and cheap. Famine was a real and ever-present dread for the lower strata of the Third Estate, and rumors of an [...] "aristocrats' plot" [...] to starve the poor were rampant and readily believed.|$|E

500|$|... "Dance in the Dark" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Lady Gaga, from her third EP, The Fame Monster. Inspired by Gaga's [...] "Fear of Self Monster", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom. According to Gaga, the record is about a girl who likes {{to have sex with}} the lights off because she is embarrassed about her body. She explained that she came across such women while working on the MAC AIDS Fund, and that the song is not about freedom, but rather <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> Gaga understood their feelings. The song was initially planned to be released after [...] "Telephone", but due to a dispute between Gaga and her record company, [...] "Alejandro" [...] was released instead. It was later released as a digital download and radio-only single in Australia, Belgium, and France.|$|E
500|$|... "Humpty Dumpty World" [...] {{incorporates}} the marimba with light reggae and Mariachi influences. The song's lyrics are sung {{from the perspective}} of God, who deplores the world He created. He makes note of incitive politicians and craven television commentators, and views it as [...] "a ball of confusion" [...] in the chorus line, [...] "I thought I had built upon a solid rock / But it’s just a Humpty Dumpty World". [...] "Christmas Time This Year" [...] is an anti-war song with a Mexican polka style, with Flaco Jiménez on accordion and Cooder on bajo sexto. Composed as a corrido, the song is about wounded soldiers returning home for Christmas, with dismal lyrics set incongruously to an upbeat Mexican melody. Cooder wrote the song in response to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal and previous stories of neglected soldiers returning from the Iraq War. In [...] "Baby Joined the Army", a young man laments the departure of his girlfriend, who became uninterested in her town and enlisted in the army with <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> [...] "If I get killed in battle, I still get paid." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opposition}} has, {{from the}} introduction of the NCMP scheme, decried it as a [...] "sham" [...] and a [...] "toothless" [...] office. Opposition member J. B. Jeyaratnam questioned whether it was [...] "a trick or a ploy" [...] by the ruling party to maintain its dominance in Parliament. It has been argued that the system has placed the opposition at a disadvantage at general elections for a number of reasons. For one, there are restrictions on NCMPs as to what they can or cannot vote on in Parliament. Thus, {{it has been suggested that}} the presence of NCMPs in Parliament [...] "does not seem to extend beyond the decorative and the provision of debating foils for the younger PAP generation unexposed to the gladiatorial quality of parliamentary debate". Moreover, the effectiveness of the NCMP scheme is limited by the perception that the NCMP is obliged to be adversarial by virtue of being party to the opposition. This is so even if privately the Member can apprehend the benefits of a Government proposal. Finally, the NCMP scheme has been criticized as a ploy to discourage voters from voting in opposition MPs because of the guarantee of at least a number of NCMP seats. This inhibits the natural growth of an elected opposition voice in Parliament as the electorate's motivation to vote in an opposition Member into Parliament is conceivably diluted by <b>the</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>that</b> a default mechanism exists for the [...] "best losers".|$|E
