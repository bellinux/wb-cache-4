40|$|The project {{focuses on}} {{identifying}} {{assets in the}} city of Whittier, California. As part of identifying the assets in the community I have specified my focus on locating resources for homeless individuals and families.

The identification of assets in Whittier was formulated through a process called asset mapping. I was informed and guided through the asset mapping process through research and literature. The asset mapping process helped me to discover the resources that were available to <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> community <b>in</b> Whittier. I found seven resources for homeless individuals and families and was able to make contact with those resources to obtain additional information about their agency and services. I found that although there were resources for <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> population <b>in</b> Whittier there were only three agencies that provided comprehensive services and shelter to <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> population. <b>The</b> other resources although helpful provided mostly food and clothing to homeless individuals and families. There appears to be a need for more comprehensive services for <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Whittier...|$|R
