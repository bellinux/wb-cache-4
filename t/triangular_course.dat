500|$|A {{circular}} staircase {{within the}} building gives {{access to the}} castle's main gun platform or water bastion, a low triangular structure projecting into the river. The castle's main armament was mounted here in the open air; this is now represented by six mid-19th century guns that are still on their original carriages. [...] There are nine embrasures in the bastion, six facing downstream and three upstream, with a rounded parapet designed to deflect shot. The water bastion was additionally protected by a wooden palisade that follows its <b>triangular</b> <b>course</b> a few metres further out in the river. The present palisade is a modern recreation of the original structure.|$|E

5000|$|They {{take place}} upon {{sufficiently}} large {{bodies of water}} to allow a course at least {{a quarter of a}} mile in length, which is generally sailed twice or three times over to windward and backward. <b>Triangular</b> <b>courses</b> are also sailed. Racing rules correspond generally to those controlling regattas of large boats, and there is full scope to exhibit all the proofs of good seamanship. The yachts are followed in light skiffs, and may not be touched more than a certain number of times during a race, on penalty of a handicap. Racing measurements differ in the various clubs, but all are based upon length and sail-area. In Great Britain the regular Yacht Racing Association rule has been generally adopted, and handicaps deducted from it. In America models are divided into a single schooner with a maximum load water-line of 63 inches, and three classes of sloops, the first class including yachts with water-lines between 48 and 53 inches, the second class those between 42 and 48 inches and the third and smallest class those between 35 and 42 inches A yacht with a shorter water line than 35 inches must race in the third class. It was previously found that yachts of smaller dimensions possessed too little resistance to the wind. However, model development means that the tiny Footy class - 12 [...] " [...] long and a boat in your briefcase - is now recognised by the Model Yachting Association in Britain and the American Model Yachting Association in the United States as well as being sailed in such countries as New Zealand, Canada, Malta, Sweden, Belgium, Brazil and Denmark.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first trial}} was held 8–13 October 1923. The {{official}} proper name was the motor-glider competition. [...] The Duke of Sutherland, {{at that time}} Under-Secretary of State for Air got the competition moving, offering a prize of £500 for the most economical British aircraft. The Daily Mail offered a similar economy prize of £1000 for a flight of more than 50 miles over a 12.5-mile <b>triangular</b> <b>course,</b> powered by an engine of less than 750 cc capacity but for an aircraft from any nation. As a result, the competition began {{to be referred to}} as the Daily Mail Motor Glider Competition. Rules were few, but the newspaper's inclusion of a capacity limit with its generous prize was adopted by all entrants. Since a single-seat aircraft was bound to be lighter and more economical than a two-seater, all entrants were single-seaters.|$|E
2500|$|There he {{took part}} in a {{pioneering}} flight of three Airco DH.9A aircraft between Egypt and Nigeria, under the command of Squadron Leader Arthur Coningham. The aircraft left Helwan Aerodrome, Cairo, on 27 October 1925, arriving at Kano, Nigeria, on 1 November, having averaged [...] per day, flying via Wadi Halfa, Khartoum and Al-Fashir in Sudan. They then returned to Helwan on 27 October, having flown [...] in 23 days. On 1 June 1926 Rowley was posted to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath. He was again placed on the half-pay list (scale B) between 10 and 18 January 1927. On 18 July 1927 he was posted to the Cadet College at RAF Cranwell. In July 1930 Rowley {{took part in}} the King's Cup Air Race, flying the Gipsy I-engined Blackburn Bluebird IV G-AAUW entered by Mrs. Robert Blackburn. Over the [...] long <b>triangular</b> <b>course</b> between London, Manchester and Newcastle, Rowley averaged , coming 42nd out of 88 competitors.|$|E

5000|$|Modified Outboard Hydroplane Racing {{classes are}} powered by {{modified}} stock outboard class motors. Motor modifications {{are limited to}} strict motor specifications and equipment alterations defined and published in APBA category rule books for these outboard hydroplane racing classes. Both stock and modified outboard classes run on a circular or <b>triangular</b> race <b>course</b> using a 3-minute [...] "milling warm-up" [...] period before a [...] "flying" [...] clock start. Heats usually consist of three laps around a closed race course. Drivers are disqualified if they cross the starting line before the official heat's clock start time (called [...] "jumping the gun".)

50|$|Except {{for service}} at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, from January to July 1923, and {{completion}} of a three-month photographic course at the Air Service Technical School, Chanute Field, Illinois, in 1925, Schilt remained at Quantico {{for the next five}} years. While attached to that post, he won second place in the Schneider International Seaplane Race at Norfolk, in November 1926, flying a special Curtiss racer at a speed of 231.3 mph (372.2 km/h) over seven laps of a <b>triangular</b> 50 km <b>course.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Close to the aerodrome at Stonehenge {{there was}} an Observation balloon School. On 23 January 1918 Briggs sent out a student pilot, Turner, to fly a <b>triangular</b> compass <b>course</b> at a height of 4,000 feet. The Observation Balloon School had a balloon up at 7,000 feet. Turner was so intent on his compass {{that he did not}} notice the cable {{tethering}} the balloon. The cable cut deeply into his right hand wing. The impact was such that the aircraft turned [...] "on to its back" [...] and started to slide down the cable, spinning rapidly around the cable. This continued till the machine was only five or six hundred feet off the ground. At this point the spinning motion flung the machine off the cable, and the machine was at the same time thrown right side up. It went into a glide and landed with no further damage on a piece of cleared ground. When some nearby artillery men ran over they found Turner still in his seat, but unconscious. When he recovered he stated that he had blacked out after the first three spins.|$|R

50|$|Many sailboats are {{significantly}} faster sailing {{on a broad}} reach than running (sailing straight downwind). Thus the increased speed of a zig-zag course of alternating broad reaches can more than {{make up for the}} extra distance it takes over a straight downwind course. Jibing is also common in racing, which often use a <b>triangular</b> <b>course</b> marked with buoys; the most direct way of rounding a buoy may be to jibe.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, Denis and Anne Burns were jointly {{awarded the}} Royal Aero Club's Britannia Trophy for their gliding achievements.
