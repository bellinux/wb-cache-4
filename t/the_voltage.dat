5|$|A voltage doubler is an {{electronic}} circuit which charges capacitors from the input voltage and switches these charges {{in such a}} way that, in the ideal case, exactly twice <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> is produced at the output as at its input.|$|E
5|$|Quebec's {{transmission}} system contains {{a variety of}} electrical pylons depending on era and voltage level. Older pylon designs tend to consume more material than the newer pylons and the higher <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> level, the larger the tower.|$|E
5|$|Controller {{advances}} have exploited dramatic increases in <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices {{over the past}} six decades. Introduced in 1983, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) has {{in the past two decades}} come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.|$|E
30|$|Following {{the control}} actions, all of <b>the</b> node <b>voltages</b> {{returned}} to within the limits, and the deviations in <b>the</b> node <b>voltages</b> decreased. <b>The</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> nodes {{before and after}} the control actions are shown in Fig.  9 c. It can be observed from the “no operations” curve that <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> nodes in feeder 1 were higher and <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> nodes in feeder 2 were lower. <b>The</b> <b>voltages</b> at node 9 and nodes 17 – 20 exceeded the upper limits and <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> at nodes 27 – 29 were below the lower limits. The “after operations” curve shows <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> nodes in the network at 0.2  s. <b>The</b> <b>voltages</b> were closer to <b>the</b> nominal <b>voltage</b> following <b>the</b> control actions.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> {{network nodes}} {{before and after}} the control actions are shown in Fig.  8 b. The “no operations” curve {{represents}} <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> nodes in the network after the load decreased and before the control actions were taken. It can be observed that <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> were much higher and those at nodes 18 – 20 exceeded the upper limits. The “after operations” curve represents <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> at <b>the</b> nodes in the network following the aforementioned control actions, which were implemented at 2  s. <b>The</b> <b>voltages</b> were closer to <b>the</b> nominal <b>voltage</b> following <b>the</b> change in the tap position.|$|R

5|$|It is {{very common}} {{practice}} for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on IEC or IEEE standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic {{to be no more}} than 3% of the fundamental and call for <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> total harmonic distortion (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.|$|E
5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a low-power device, with high-power mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The charging port may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> drops to 2V.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in lightning arresters in electric power systems. These devices must exhibit high resistance until <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> across them reaches a certain threshold VT {{at which point}} their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied voltage drops below VT.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> input <b>voltage</b> is {{positive}}, <b>the</b> output <b>voltage</b> is {{a positive}} value, when <b>the</b> input <b>voltage</b> is negative, <b>the</b> output <b>voltage</b> is a negative value. The magnitude of <b>the</b> output <b>voltage</b> is a property of the operational amplifier and its power supply.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> surge <b>voltage</b> is {{standardized}} in IEC/EN 60384-1. For aluminum {{electrolytic capacitors}} with a rated voltage {{of up to}} 315V, <b>the</b> surge <b>voltage</b> is 1.15 times <b>the</b> rated <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a rated <b>voltage</b> exceeding 315V, <b>the</b> surge <b>voltage</b> is 1.10 times <b>the</b> rated <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
50|$|For polymer Al-e-caps <b>the</b> surge <b>voltage</b> is 1.15 times <b>the</b> rated <b>voltage.</b> For polymer Ta-e-caps <b>the</b> surge <b>voltage</b> can be 1.3 times <b>the</b> rated <b>voltage,</b> {{rounded off}} to the nearest volt.|$|R
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc is directly related to <b>the</b> <b>voltage,</b> and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> varies. This is important because in manual welding, {{it can be difficult to}} hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
5|$|Tram no. 141 {{arrived at}} Oslo on 5 January 1999 in three parts. They were {{connected}} together and tried within {{the end of}} the month on the entire network, prior to the delivery of tram 142. Delivery frequency was set to every two weeks. During periods from April through June, <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> along sections of the Lilleaker Line was raised from 600 to 750V; this included trials with the SL95 to ensure that it could operate under this current as well.|$|E
5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC. They were driven by turbines. <b>The</b> <b>voltage</b> was {{stepped up to}} 100,000 volts using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were housed in {{the south end of}} {{the generator}} building.|$|E
50|$|In {{the ideal}} FDA, the {{difference}} of <b>the</b> output <b>voltages</b> is equal <b>the</b> difference between <b>the</b> input <b>voltages</b> multiplied by <b>the</b> gain. <b>The</b> common mode <b>voltage</b> of <b>the</b> output <b>voltages</b> is not dependent of <b>the</b> input <b>voltage.</b> In many cases, <b>the</b> common mode <b>voltage</b> can be directly set by a third voltage input.|$|R
50|$|One method {{measures}} <b>the</b> output <b>voltage.</b> When it {{is lower}} than <b>the</b> desired <b>voltage,</b> it turns on the switch. When <b>the</b> output <b>voltage</b> is above <b>the</b> desired <b>voltage,</b> it turns off the switch.|$|R
50|$|So at DC (0 Hz), <b>the</b> {{capacitor}} <b>voltage</b> is {{in phase}} with <b>the</b> signal <b>voltage</b> while <b>the</b> resistor <b>voltage</b> leads it by 90°. As frequency increases, <b>the</b> capacitor <b>voltage</b> comes {{to have a}} 90° lag relative to the signal and <b>the</b> resistor <b>voltage</b> comes to be in-phase with the signal.|$|R
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{a number}} of {{expansions}} {{were made to the}} tram network. The disused line from Storo via the depot at Grefsen to Sinsen opened for revenue traffic in 1993. In 1995, the Vika Line was constructed to access Aker Brygge, a new waterfront neighbourhood is the southwestern part of the city centre, and in 1999, the Ullevål Hageby Line was extended to the new Rikshospitalet. For these new lines, 32 SL95 low-floor trams were delivered from 1996 to 2004, replacing all but the SL79 units. <b>The</b> <b>voltage</b> was increased from 600 to 750volts on 4 June 2000, once all non-articulated trams had been retired.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> bus <b>voltage</b> in {{frequency}} domain {{can be calculated}} by summing <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> on C1 and C2. From the calculation result {{it can be seen}} that <b>the</b> bus <b>voltage</b> only relates to C2 current, voltage transformer current and their ratios.This result is helpful to reconstruct <b>the</b> bus <b>voltage</b> with <b>the</b> C2 current, <b>voltage</b> transformer current. For the ratio, it can be achieved by using a summing amplifier.|$|R
40|$|A {{low voltage}} power supply {{provides}} <b>the</b> regulated output <b>voltage</b> of 1 V from <b>the</b> supply <b>voltage</b> around 48 V. <b>The</b> low <b>voltage</b> power supply incorporates a ceramic transformer which utilizes piezoelectric effect to convert <b>voltage.</b> <b>The</b> ceramic transformer isolates the secondary from the primary, thus providing the ground isolation between the supply and <b>the</b> output <b>voltages.</b> <b>The</b> ceramic transformer takes {{the place of}} the conventional magnetic transformer. The ceramic transformer is constructed from a ceramic bar and does not include any magnetic material. So <b>the</b> low <b>voltage</b> power supply can operate under a magnetic field. <b>The</b> output <b>voltage</b> is stabilized by feedback. A feedback loop consists of an error amplifier, a voltage controlled oscillator and a driver circuit. The amplitude ratio of the transformer has dependence on the frequency, which is utilized to stabilize <b>the</b> output <b>voltage.</b> <b>The</b> low <b>voltage</b> power supply is investigated on the analogy of <b>the</b> high <b>voltage</b> power supply similarly incorporating the ceramic transformer. Stability of the power supplies is studied from the theoretical viewpoint of the stability. It is shown that the compensation, which has been applied to <b>the</b> high <b>voltage</b> ceramic transformer, could work similarly for <b>the</b> low <b>voltage</b> power supply...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> output <b>voltage</b> {{always has}} <b>the</b> same sign as <b>the</b> op-amp input <b>voltage</b> {{but it does}} not always have the same sign as <b>the</b> circuit input <b>voltage</b> (<b>the</b> signs of <b>the</b> two input <b>voltages</b> can differ). When <b>the</b> circuit input <b>voltage</b> is above <b>the</b> high {{threshold}} or below the low threshold, <b>the</b> output <b>voltage</b> has <b>the</b> same sign as <b>the</b> circuit input <b>voltage</b> (<b>the</b> circuit is non-inverting). It acts like a comparator that switches at a different point depending on whether the output of the comparator is high or low. When <b>the</b> circuit input <b>voltage</b> is between <b>the</b> thresholds, <b>the</b> output <b>voltage</b> is undefined and it depends on the last state (the circuit behaves as an elementary latch).|$|R
5|$|The tower's {{electrical}} service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800volts. The electricity {{passed through the}} World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts, and <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{time-frame}} of {{the capacitance}} change (as much as 50ms at 20Hz audio signal), {{the charge is}} practically constant and <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. <b>The</b> <b>voltage</b> across the capacitor varies {{above and below the}} bias voltage. <b>The</b> <b>voltage</b> difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. <b>The</b> <b>voltage</b> across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> remaining constant.|$|E
25|$|For {{capacitors}} with a {{rated voltage}} of ≤ 315 volts <b>the</b> surge <b>voltage</b> is 1.15 times <b>the</b> rated <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315 volts <b>the</b> surge <b>voltage</b> is 1.10 times <b>the</b> rated <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{trend is}} towards lower core voltages, which {{conserve}} power. This presents the CMOS designer with a challenge, because in CMOS <b>the</b> <b>voltages</b> go only to ground and <b>the</b> supply <b>voltage,</b> <b>the</b> source, gate, and drain terminals of the FETs have only <b>the</b> supply <b>voltage</b> or zero voltage across them.|$|R

25|$|In this case, the {{operational}} amplifier drives the transistor with more current if <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> at its inverting input drops below {{the output of}} <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> reference at the non-inverting input. Using <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> divider (R1, R2 and R3) allows choice of the arbitrary output voltage between Uz and Uin.|$|E
