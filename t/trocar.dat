25|$|A {{peripheral}} cannula is {{the most}} common intravenous access method utilized in both hospitals and pre-hospital services. A peripheral IV line (PVC or PIV) consists of a short catheter (a few centimeters long) inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein (any vein not situated in the chest or abdomen). This is usually {{in the form of a}} cannula-over-needle device, in which a flexible plastic cannula comes mounted over a metal <b>trocar.</b> Once the tip of the needle and cannula are introduced into the vein via venipuncture, the cannula is advanced inside the vein over the <b>trocar</b> to the appropriate position and secured, the <b>trocar</b> is then withdrawn and discarded. Blood samples may be drawn directly after the initial IV cannula insertion.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 16th century, anatomist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) {{described}} a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. He advised using a vertical incision and was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. This was a straight, short cannula that incorporated wings to prevent the tube from advancing too far into the trachea. He recommended the operation {{only as a last resort}} in cases of airway obstruction by foreign bodies or secretions. Fabricius' description of the tracheotomy procedure is similar to that used today. Julius Casserius (1561–1616) succeeded Fabricius as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and published his own writings regarding technique and equipment for tracheotomy, recommending a curved silver tube with several holes in it. Marco Aurelio Severino (1580–1656), a skillful surgeon and anatomist, performed multiple successful tracheotomies during a diphtheria epidemic in Naples in 1610, using the vertical incision technique recommended by Fabricius. He also developed his own version of a <b>trocar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sanctorius (1561–1636) is {{believed}} to be the first to use a <b>trocar</b> in the operation. He recommended leaving the cannula in place for a few days following the operation. Early tracheostomy devices are illustrated in Habicot’s Question Chirurgicale and Julius Casserius' posthumous Tabulae anatomicae in 1627. Thomas Fienus (1567–1631), Professor of Medicine at the University of Louvain, was the first to use the word [...] "tracheotomy" [...] in 1649, but this term was not commonly used until a century later. Georg Detharding (1671–1747), professor of anatomy at the University of Rostock, treated a drowning victim with tracheostomy in 1714.|$|E
30|$|When {{inserting}} {{the secondary}} <b>trocars,</b> {{this must be}} under direct vision and {{with the presence of}} an adequate pneumoperitoneum. The <b>trocars</b> should be inserted perpendicular to the fascia and then directed towards the surgical site.|$|R
30|$|Results: Operative {{times were}} the same as those {{obtained}} with conventional <b>trocars.</b> No specific complications were noted. The incisions were smaller than that observed for <b>trocars</b> of 5 mm diameter and could be closed by glue.|$|R
30|$|Material and Methods: 43 {{patients}} received laparoscopic interventions {{longer than}} 10 minutes. We used 5 mm working <b>trocars</b> bearing a plain sleeve. The fixator device {{was attached to}} one of the two side <b>trocars</b> prior to insertion. In 18 patients an unsutured fixator was used (FX-US-subgroup). In 25 patients the device was sutured to the skin through specially suturing ports (FX-S-subgroup). Position of both <b>trocars</b> was evaluated {{at the start of the}} procedure and eventually every 10 minutes intraoperatively.|$|R

50|$|The most {{significant}} risks are from <b>trocar</b> injuries during insertion into the abdominal cavity, as the <b>trocar</b> is typically inserted blindly.

50|$|The desired vessel or cavity is {{punctured}} {{with a sharp}} {{hollow needle}} called a <b>trocar,</b> with ultrasound guidance if necessary.

A sheath or blunt cannula can now be passed over the guidewire into the cavity or vessel. Alternatively, drainage tubes are passed over the guidewire (as in chest drains or nephrostomies). After passing a sheath or tube, the guidewire is withdrawn.|$|E

5000|$|Trocars {{are also}} used {{near the end of}} the {{embalming}} process to provide drainage of bodily fluids and organs after the vascular replacement of blood with embalming chemicals. Rather than a round tube being inserted, the three sided knife of the classic <b>trocar</b> would split the outer skin into three [...] "wings" [...] which was then easily sutured closed in a less obtrusive way. It is attached to a suction hose (which usually is attached to a running water source and drain known as a hydroaspirator). The process of removing gas, fluids, and semi-solids from the body cavities and hollow organs using the <b>trocar</b> is known as aspiration. The instrument is inserted into the body two inches to the left and two inches up from the navel. After the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities have been aspirated, the embalmer injects cavity fluid into the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities using a smaller <b>trocar</b> attached via a hose which is connected to a bottle of high index cavity fluid. The bottle is held upside down in the air so as to let gravity take the cavity fluid through the <b>trocar</b> and into the cavities. The embalmer moves the <b>trocar</b> in the same manner that he or she used when aspirating the cavities in order to fully and evenly distribute the chemical.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} {{has traditionally}} been performed with four incisions to insert four <b>trocars,</b> in a simple, efficient and safe way. AIM: To describe a simplified technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with two incisions, using basic conventional instrumental. TECHNIQUE: In one incision in the umbilicus are applied two <b>trocars</b> and in epigastrium one more. The use of two <b>trocars</b> on the same incision, working in "x" does not hinder the procedure and does not require special instruments. CONCLUSION: Simplified laparoscopic cholecystectomy with two incisions is feasible and easy to perform, allowing to operate with ergonomy and safety, with good cosmetic result...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: to {{identify}} the microbial charge present in reusable <b>trocars</b> used in gynecological laparoscopies. Methods: a descriptive exploratory study. An amount of 57 <b>trocars,</b> 30 with 10 mm of diameter and 27 with 5 mm, have been collected from the surgical unit, immediately after the surgery {{and placed in a}} sterilized recipient, in which 250 mL of sterile distilled water was added. Then, the <b>trocars</b> were agitated for the drainage of particles and to obtain a wash-out fluid to be analyzed. After being filtered through 0. 22 μm cellulose membrane, the residue was placed on blood agar plates with a sterilized forceps. Following incubation, microbiological analysis has been done to count the number of colonies and further identify the microorganisms, using standard laboratorial techniques. Results: microbial charge was recovered from 47. 4 % of the <b>trocars</b> analyzed. Among those, 45. 6 % presented 1 to 100 growing colonies. Fourteen types of microorganisms have been identified, among which the more frequently isolated were coagulase- negative Staphylococcus (28 %) and Bacillus sp (21 %), Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes sp, Candida parapsilosis, and enterobacteries were also identified. Conclusions: the study has demonstrated that the microbial challenge faced by the technician responsible for the cleaning and sterilization of <b>trocars</b> is low, as compared to the challenge imposed by biological markers. Nevertheless, it may be not inferred that the risks for infectious complications for patients are minimal...|$|R
