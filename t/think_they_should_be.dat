[...] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, {{which was published in}} October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.|$|E
500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I think every psychiatrist should be made to listen to those songs [...] I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> part of the curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E

5000|$|Graeber {{notes that}} Americans largely dislike bureaucracies, but {{while they are}} not {{motivated}} to change bureaucracies, he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> He makes an urgent call to remove the bureaucratic limits that hamper creativity. He argues that the [...] "order and regularity" [...] of bureaucracy is more harmful than valuable, and elaborates that rules do not apply equally in practice and are more [...] "instruments through which the human imagination is smashed and shattered".|$|R
2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them.

This goes for Evanlyn, which gets {{to work in the}} kitchen, but Will unfortunately gets the job of working the yard, the deadliest place for slaves to work. Will soon gets the attention from the older crowds, and one of them tricks him to get addicted to a deadly drug, warmweed.|$|R

2500|$|At the 2011 CPAC, {{during her}} question-and-answer segment, Coulter {{was asked about}} GOProud and the {{controversy}} over their exclusion from the 2011 CPAC.

They begin working with Terri at Sheets-N-Things. Expressing the dissatisfaction in their lives, Puck, Finn, Terri, customer Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), and employee Howard Bamboo (Kent Avenido) perform [...] "Loser" [...] in a dream sequence.

Mace claims that he knows the truth about why they, and all of their counterparts, were brought here: Stark, the Mason of this universe, for all of his wealth and power hates his own life as well — and was looking for a version of himself who was happy, and whom he could replace.

60|$|She wandered {{back to her}} rock-pools; {{they were}} bright and docile; they did not fling her about {{in a game of}} terror. She bent over {{watching}} the anemone's fleshy petals shrink from the touch of her shadow, and she laughed to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> so needlessly fearful. The flowing tide trickled noiselessly among the rocks, widening and deepening insidiously her little pools. Helena retreated towards a large cave round the bend. There the water gurgled under the bladder-wrack of the large stones; the air was cool and clammy. She pursued her way into the gloom, bending, though there was no need, shivering at the coarse feel of the seaweed beneath her naked feet. The water came rustling up beneath the fucus as she crept along on the big stones; it returned with a quiet gurgle which made her shudder, though even that was not disagreeable. It needed, for all that, more courage than was easy to summon before she could step off her stone into the black pool that confronted her. It was festooned thick with weeds that slid under her feet like snakes. She scrambled hastily upwards towards the outlet.|$|E
