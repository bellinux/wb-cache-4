5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk <b>than</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks <b>than</b> <b>whites,</b> or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker <b>than</b> <b>whites.</b> Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E

25|$|Asian {{people and}} black {{people have a}} thicker dermis <b>than</b> <b>white</b> people. The skin of Asian people and black people also has more sun {{protection}} than the skin of white people due to Asian people and black people having larger and more numerous melanosomes in their skin <b>than</b> <b>white</b> people. The thicker dermis and the more numerous melanosomes of larger size might be the reasons that Asian people and black people have a lower incidence facial wrinkles <b>than</b> <b>white</b> people.|$|R

There are however racial and social health disparities, in 2010 African Americans experienced 28% more premature deaths <b>than</b> <b>whites,</b> while 13% of Virginians lack any health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 survey, 26% of Virginians are obese and another 35% are overweight. 78% of residents claim to have exercised at least once in the past three months. About 30% of Virginia's 10- to 17-year-olds are overweight or obese. Virginia banned smoking in bars and restaurants in January 2010. 19% of Virginians smoke tobacco.

African-American and white women who are screened at the same intervals have similar-stage tumors at diagnosis, but African-American women have higher-grade tumors <b>than</b> <b>white</b> women regardless of screening frequency.

25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{segregation}} {{along racial lines}} contributes to public goods inequalities. Whites and blacks are vastly more likely to support different candidates for mayor <b>than</b> <b>whites</b> and blacks in more integrated places, which makes them less able to build consensus. The lack of consensus leads to lower levels of public spending.|$|E
25|$|Black people {{account for}} 60% of Minneapolis Police Department's {{low-level}} arrests, overall. Between 2012-14 Minneapolis police arrested Blacks nearly ten (10) times more for low-level offenses <b>than</b> <b>whites.</b> Police officers have more options {{for how to}} respond to low-level offenses, which, if they lead to an arrest can start or sustain a downward spiral of a life-cycle of arrests, incarceration and unemployment. Of nearly 10,000 low-level arrests over 33 months made by 1,017 Minneapolis officers between 2013–14, the vast majority were made by eight officers. Seven averaged between 1,000-1,250. One made 2,026. In 2014, The average low-level arrests per officer was 51. Even taking out the eight officers who make the majority of arrests, black citizens were still arrested 8.5 times more <b>than</b> <b>whites</b> were for overall low-level violations. Low-level offenses include things like: curfew violations, loitering, trespassing, drinking in public, and open bottle.|$|E

25|$|An {{investigation}} of the feminization of poverty between 1959 and 1984 discovered {{a substantial increase in}} the percentage of female poor in the 1960s, but not in the 1970s or 1980s. The percentage remained relatively constant between 1969 and 1979, and then decreased between 1979 and 1984. The principal source of feminization of poverty was the proportion of women in one-sex households. This was more adverse for blacks <b>than</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|E

3000|$|In {{the third}} and fourth panels, we find that visible {{minority}} immigrants are approximately 8 percentage points more likely to remain with the initial employer without being promoted and 6 percentage points more likely to move to a new employer between interviews <b>than</b> similar <b>white</b> natives—although neither difference is statistically significant. 19 By contrast, white immigrants are nearly 12 percentage points more likely to move to new employers between interviews <b>than</b> <b>white</b> natives—a difference that is statistically distinguishable from zero at the 10 % level in most specifications and highlights the differences in mobility among immigrants with different ethnic backgrounds. While white immigrants exhibit a higher degree of interfirm mobility <b>than</b> <b>white</b> natives, they enjoy a similar probability of promotion when remaining with their initial employers. Visible minority immigrants, on the other hand, are also slightly more likely <b>than</b> <b>white</b> natives to move to new employers but are much less likely <b>than</b> <b>white</b> natives to be promoted when remaining with their initial employers.

25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why {{women are more likely}} than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education <b>than</b> <b>whites.</b> There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding in inner-city schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the county}} was $37,439, and the median income for a family was $42,608. Males had a median income of $30,576 versus $26,628 for females. The per capita income for the county was $19,222. About 16.9% of families and 24.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.8% of those under age 18 and 13.0% of those age 65 or over.

5000|$|In the United States, most {{minority}} groups {{are more likely}} to live in poverty <b>than</b> <b>White</b> Americans.

And although Asian American families earn, on average, more income <b>than</b> <b>White</b> American families do, there are usually more family members working in the Asian American family <b>than</b> the <b>White</b> American family. These disparities in socioeconomic status between {{minority groups}} and White Americans help explain differences in parenting styles, family structure, and the resultant educational achievement of minority children. However, the racial gaps persists when comparing families with similar income.
