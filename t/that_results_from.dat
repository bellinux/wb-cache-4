We define learning as ontogenetic adaptation—that is, as changes {{in the behavior of}} an organism <b>that</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> regularities in the environment of the organism. This functional definition not only solves the problems of other definitions, but also has important advantages for cognitive learning research...|$|R

5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
5|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field {{can be understood}} as a gauge field, i.e., as a field <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently at every position in spacetime. For the {{electromagnetic field}}, this gauge symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value 1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex field without affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the energy or the Lagrangian.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} and develop in any {{geographic}} location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes. Thunderstorms {{are responsible for}} the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the time of year with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|By 1938, the Engineering Experiment Station was {{producing}} useful technology, and the station needed {{a method to}} conduct contract work outside the state budget. Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. The IDC was created as a non-profit contract organization for the EES, which allowed the EES to receive federal contracts while still retaining its relationship with Georgia Tech and the State of Georgia. It {{was created by the}} Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the Engineering Experiment Station's director {{was a member of the}} council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments. In addition, the contract organization manages the intellectual property <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> research.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E

5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
5|$|Most TBI <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> blunt trauma occurs {{within the}} chest. The most common {{tracheal}} injury is a tear near the carina {{or in the}} membranous wall of the trachea. In blunt chest trauma, TBI occurs within 2.5cm of the carina 40–80% of the time. The injury {{is more common in}} the right main bronchus than the left, possibly because the former is near vertebrae, which may injure it. Also, the aorta and other tissues in the mid chest that surround the left main bronchus may protect it. Another possibility is that people with left main bronchus injuries are more likely to also have other deadly injuries and therefore die before reaching hospital, making them less likely to be included in studies that determine rates of injuries.|$|E
5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E

Shirotsuki's soul becomes trapped inside a squirrel-like creature called a gusk, and his real body is lost in a fire <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> his magical protection wards; Hibiki and the gusk barely escape alive. With nowhere else to go, Hibiki takes up residence in the nearby capital city Kamigusk. Hibiki is surprised that Shirotsuki's reputation precedes him, and she is taken to the local Kamisaid Magic Academy where she is given the position of professor. Hibiki's attempts to convince the administration of her shortcomings meet with failure. Hibiki is forced to learn to cope with being a professor in the most famous magic school in the country and meets many new people that help her along the way.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} <b>that</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> {{the relationship}} between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
