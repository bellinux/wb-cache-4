5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E
5|$|In the 1945 election, the Communists were unopposed because <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> abstained. Once in power, the Communists {{introduced}} a single-party political system, {{in which the}} Communist Party of Yugoslavia was the ruling party and the Communist Party of Croatia was its branch. In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld {{a claim for}} derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> to the contracts and arrangements.|$|E

5|$|The Centre Democrats did {{not gain}} enough votes for {{parliamentary}} {{representation in the}} 1986 general election, but Janmaat won back his seat after the following election in 1989. In 1994 he was joined by two additional representatives won by the party. The CD was subject to a cordon sanitaire by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> in Parliament, although some parties rather sought to confront it following its 1994 success. The CD failed to win any seats in the 1998 election, and it fell into disarray until it was finally dissolved in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The party {{became the}} second largest party in Norway {{for the first time}} in the 1997 {{parliamentary}} election, a position it also held following the elections in 2005 and 2009; in 2013 it dropped to third largest. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> in parliament historically refused any formal governmental cooperation with the Progress Party, but after a long period of work to unite the political right in Norway, helped by Siv Jensen devising a more moderate liberal leadership, the party entered into a coalition with the Conservative Party, which from 2013 makes up the current Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{seat was}} made more {{competitive}} in the 1997 boundary review by {{the formation of the}} North West Cambridgeshire seat, which incorporated the rural land outside Peterborough and several Conservative-inclined wards from the city. Since its formation, North West Cambridgeshire {{has been one of the}} safest Conservative seats in the country, whilst Peterborough was ranked 93rd in the Conservatives's one hundred most vulnerable seats (the ones which <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> must take if there is to be a change of government) and 73rd on Labour's target list; these factors led Mawhinney to stand in North West Cambridgeshire instead.|$|E
50|$|Escrow {{services}} {{are intended to}} ensure security by acting as a middleman in transactions where the two parties do not trust each other. Rather than sending money or goods directly to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> (which is insecure, as one or <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> must send its item first, at the risk that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> may not reciprocate), both parties send their items to the escrow service, which holds them until both items are received, then sends each on to the intended recipient. If either party fails to deliver its part of <b>the</b> deal, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> item {{will be held at}} the escrow service and eventually returned.|$|R

[...] A {{draconian}} {{solution to}} a deadlock, a Russian roulette provision requires {{one of the two}} deadlocked parties to serve a notice on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party,</b> and <b>the</b> serving party will name an all-cash price at which it values a half interest in the business. [...] The party receiving the notice then has the option to either buy <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> out, or sell out to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party,</b> at that price.|$|R
40|$|A {{quasi-experiment}} {{tested the}} effects of honor values {{and the use of}} insults by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> on perceived conflict, negative emotions, and intentions to behave distributively and integratively during a workplace conflict. After honor values were measured, participants read a scenario in which a conflict was described. In the scenarios, we manipulated whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> used an insult by describing <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> statements such that either an insult was uttered or no insult was uttered. Consistent with our hypotheses, results showed that conflicts in which <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> used an insult lead to higher ratings of perceived conflict, more negative emotions, and stronger intentions to engage in distributive behavior than conflicts in which <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> did not use an insult in high-honor-value participants, but not in low-honor-value participants. Mediation analyses showed that the interactive effect of honor values and <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> insults on intentions to behave distributively could be explained by perceived conflict and negative emotions...|$|R
5|$|This {{second vote}} was {{challenged}} {{by a local}} Gaelic Athletic Association club, Thomas Davis who wanted the vote on 13 January 2006 declared illegal thus forcing the county council to build the GAA stadium. Thomas Davis claimed that {{the capacity of the}} stadium (initially 6,000, ultimately 10,000) would not be affected by the change, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> involved disputed this and argued that the capacity would be reduced. Requests {{under the freedom of information}} act to both South Dublin County Council and the Department of Sport showed that Thomas Davis had not submitted any plans showing that capacity would not be affected.|$|E
5|$|While {{the leaders}} of Congress languished in jail, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> {{supported}} the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had little control over events. At {{the end of the}} war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.|$|E
5|$|As {{the leader}} of the NCP, the largest party in parliament, Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new {{coalition}} government. He said that the result of the election supported a coalition consisting of the three largest parties, i.e. the National Coalition, the Social Democratic Party and the True Finns. The most problematic question was believed to be the EU bailout policy, where the True Finns most differ from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties.</b> Formal negotiations on government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April, starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.|$|E
50|$|Under {{contract}} law, in {{a bilateral}} contract {{two or more}} parties owe obligations to each <b>other.</b> Each <b>party</b> acts in reliance that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> will fulfill their respective obligation. If one party fails to respect their obligation, then <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> or parties may suffer an economic harm. Reliance damages compensate the harmed party/ies {{for the amount of}} damages they suffered for acting in reliance on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party's</b> contractual obligations. They are most often rewarded when the aggrieved party's damages are not capable of accurate estimation, and ordering Specific Performance would be inappropriate.|$|R
5000|$|Fraud: Fraud {{is defined}} to be a {{misrepresentation}} of a material fact {{by a person}} who is aware of his or her actions, with the intention of misleading <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> injured as a result.|$|R

If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> to <b>the</b> marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} June, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> {{had been}} intimidated into disbanding. This {{included}} the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA's help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany. The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along {{with a number of}} Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot. While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties.</b> The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{implementing}} Rule 5 begins with picking the best chooser. Usually, the best chooser is the smallest number party. The best chooser will then have to “compare its own opportunity cost to the opportunity cost (figured by the judge) of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> or parties.” <b>The</b> second step is {{the implementation of the}} double-reverse twist proposed by Krier and Schwab. First, the judge estimates <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party’s</b> social costs (damages caused by the best chooser). [...] Then, the judge enters an order requiring the best chooser to decide whether to continue causing damage to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> without receiving any compensation or stop causing damage and receive compensation. [...] Therefore, if the best chooser decides to stop causing harm to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party,</b> then <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> will have to pay the best chooser damages calculated by the judge. Should the best chooser decide to stay, then the best chooser continues to cause harm and receives no payment.|$|R
50|$|Many key {{exchange}} {{systems have}} one party generate the key, and simply send that key to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> -- <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> has no {{influence on the}} key.Using a key-agreement protocol avoids {{some of the key}} distribution problems associated with such systems.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Some {{covenants}} are conditional (if {{one party}} does A, then <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> will do B), {{just as with}} a present-day contract. But generally, ancient covenants are unconditional (each party commits to a certain action, regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>party</b> keeps <b>the</b> covenant).|$|R
5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{continued}} to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% {{of the vote in}} the 2000 local elections. In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights. In the 2004 Flemish Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the formateur for government discussions, only to find that its differences with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the cordon sanitaire. By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.|$|E
5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} {{is made up}} of 42 councillors. After the May 2014 local elections, the Conservatives formed a {{minority}} administration with just 12councillors. The largest party within the council is the Liberal Democrats with 19councillors (including the Lord Mayor). <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> represented in council are the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and Labour, with five and four Councillors, respectively. There are also two independent councillors, Eleanor Scott (elected as a Liberal Democrat) and Paul Godier (elected as UKIP). Councillors are returned from 14wards, with each ward having three councillors and a four-year term. The leader of the council is the Conservative Donna Jones. The position of Lord Mayor of Portsmouth is usually held for a one-year period.|$|E

5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties</b> to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} Thursday 6 May 2010 and saw an increase in voter turnout from 61% in 2005 to 65% in 2010. Throughout the day GfK NOP and Ipsos MORI conducted an exit poll {{on behalf of the}} BBC, Sky and ITV news services – the results of which were announced as the polls closed at 10:00pm. Data gathered from individuals at 130 polling stations around the country suggested a hung parliament, with an initial estimate that the Conservative Party would achieve 307 seats–19 seats short of a controlling majority. This deficit was later adjusted to 21 seats. The distribution of seats was initially predicted to be 307 to the Conservatives, 255 to Labour, 59 to the Liberal Democrats and 29 to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parties,</b> but these figures were later updated with a minor adjustment in Labour's favour. The apparently poor prospects for the Liberal Democrats were a surprise to commentators, as many previous opinion polls had indicated they would receive more seats. A later BBC exit poll published at 5:36am on Friday 7 May predicted the Conservatives on 306, 20 short of an overall majority, with Labour on 262, and the Liberal Democrats on 55.|$|E
