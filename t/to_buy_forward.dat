40|$|Manufacturer-supported trade deals remain one of {{the major}} {{competitive}} tools in today's marketplace. This is true despite the fact that such trade deals are often claimed to be unprofitable for manufacturers. The unprofitability is attributed to the fact that retailers <b>forward</b> <b>buy</b> and do not pass the price discounts on to the consumers. The audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who have been concerned with the ubiquitous practice of trade dealing in spite of its purported unprofitability. The paper attempts to understand the motivations for trade dealing by comparing the profitability of trade dealing in the presence of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> <b>to</b> a situation in which retailers carry no inventory. Moreover, we shed light on why manufacturers sometimes offer trade deals even though the retailers do not pass through these deals to the consumers. We study the problem of trade dealing through an economic model that includes the manufacturers, the retailer, and the consumers. In this way we include all three levels of the distribution system, and model the dynamic effects of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> by the retailer. The main features of the model can be summarized as follows. At the manufacturer level, each of two manufacturers is allowed to offer a regular price and a deal price, which, if accepted by the retailer, requires the retailer to display and merchandise the product. Moreover, the manufacturer is assumed to incur a selling cost with respect to offering a trade deal. The retailer, on the other hand, decides whether to accept the deal, determines how much to order, and sets the retail prices of the two brands. The retailer needs to set a price below the regular price to achieve maximum effectiveness from its display and merchandising activities. If the retailer accepts a trade deal, it incurs a fixed cost of display and merchandising the product reflecting the opportunity cost of display. If the retailer does not accept the trade deal, it can order at the non-deal price. Furthermore, the retailer can order more than what can be sold to the consumers in that period, i. e, <b>forward</b> <b>buy.</b> The retailer can carry inventory from either manufacturer at a cost but has an upper limit to the total amount of inventory carried in any period. The consumer population is assumed to consist of brand loyals and switchers. The brand loyals buy as long as the price is below the reservation price, while the switchers choose the brand on display if the retail price is lower than the regular price and the price of the competing brand. With these as the basic elements of the model, we characterize the equilibrium manufacturer and retailer pricing strategies with and without inventories in an infinite-horizon model with discounting. The central result of the paper is derived by comparing the profits to the manufacturers for the case when retailers are allowed <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>buy</b> <b>to</b> the case when they are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>buy.</b> This comparison shows that although <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> is profitable <b>to</b> the retailer through the availability of goods at lower prices, an important consequence of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> is the decreased intensity of competition between manufacturers. The decrease in the intensity of competition yields higher profits to the manufacturers as compared to the case where the retailer is not allowed to carry any inventory. The intuition behind our result is seen by taking a closer look at intensity of trade dealing in the presence and absence of <b>forward</b> <b>buying.</b> Consider the worst and the best trade deals offered by manufacturers, in equilibrium, when the retailer is not allowed to carry any inventory and explore their viability when the retailer is allowed to inventory. If the retailer is allowed to carry inventory and holds some inventory, the worst trade deals become unacceptable to the retailer. This is because the inventory allows the retailer <b>to</b> not <b>buy</b> all the units demanded in the subsequent period, and the retailer can therefore reject such trade deals. Similarly, the best trade deals offered by manufacturers when the retailer is not allowed to inventory do not remain as profitable because the retailer <b>forward</b> <b>buys</b> and the manufacturers lose future sales and profits. Thus trade deals at both extremes (the best and the worst) that were profitable to the manufacturers when the retailer is not allowed <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>buy</b> are no longer viable when the retailer is allowed <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>buy.</b> This increases the overall probability of not offering trade deals and leads to decreased intensity of competition. competition, trade promotions, merchandising, <b>forward</b> <b>buying...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the strategic use of forward contracts {{in an industry}} where downstream firms must buy an essential input from imperfectly competitive upstream suppliers. When a single large firm and a fringe of firms exist downstream, the large firm <b>buys</b> <b>forward</b> contracts from the fringe, i. e. there is horizontal subcontracting from the large firm to the firms on the fringe, {{in order to make}} the spot market less competitive. Hence our paper argues that horizontal subcontracting becomes an anti-competitive device. We also compare the strategies of <b>buying</b> <b>forward</b> contracts and purchasing productive capacity and we find that both are equivalent tools. When the downstream industry has instead several large firms, they have a "horizontal" incentive to sell forward contracts in order to gain market share, but the former "vertical" incentive <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> them persists. In this case, forward contracting may then lead to less competition in the spot market. Intermediate markets, buyer power, forward contracts, horizontal subcontracting...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance <b>Forward</b> <b>Buying</b> (NPPAFB) method, applies a <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> algorithm <b>to</b> {{determine the number of}} periods for which <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>buy</b> allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases). Additionally, NPPAFB also authorizes unused emissions allowances to be sold when market conditions are favorable. Compared against three existing production planning and allowance procurement strategies, a simulation exercise finds that the NPPAFB method significantly reduces a firm 2 ̆ 7 s emissions allowance expenditures. These results indicate that heuristic can be readily adopted by any firm that is required to procure emissions allowances via open markets in an effort to improve the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability...|$|R

This scam is of about Rs. 2200 crores & involves fraudulent printing & sale of stamp papers in the {{various parts of the}} country. Up to the early 90s, banks in India were not allowed to invest in the equity markets. However, they were expected to post profits and to retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed interest bonds. Mehta cleverly squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of banks and pumped this money into the share market [...] He also promised the banks higher rates of interest, while asking them to transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for them from other banks. At that time, a bank had to go through a broker <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> securities and <b>forward</b> bonds from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in his account <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> shares, thus hiking up demand of certain shares (of good established companies like ACC, Sterlite Industries and Videocon) dramatically, selling them off, passing on a part of the proceeds to the bank and keeping the rest for himself. This resulted in stocks like ACC (which was trading in 1991 for Rs. 200/share) to nearly Rs. 9000 in just 3 months.|$|R
50|$|The similar {{situation}} works among currency forwards, {{in which one}} party opens a <b>forward</b> contract <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> or sell a currency (ex. a contract <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Canadian dollars) <b>to</b> expire/settle at a future date, as they {{do not wish to}} be exposed to exchange rate/currency risk over a period of time. As the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars fluctuates between the trade date and the earlier of the date at which the contract is closed or the expiration date, one party gains and the counterparty loses as one currency strengthens against the other. Sometimes, the <b>buy</b> <b>forward</b> is opened because the investor will actually need Canadian dollars at a future date such as to pay a debt owed that is denominated in Canadian dollars. Other times, the party opening a forward does so, not because they need Canadian dollars nor because they are hedging currency risk, but because they are speculating on the currency, expecting the exchange rate to move favorably to generate a gain on closing the contract.|$|R

The manufacturer attempts to maximize its profits by advertising directly to consumers and offering periodic trade deal discounts to the retailer {{in the hope that the}} retailer will in turn "pass through" a retailer promotion to the consumer. We show how the manufacturer's optimal allocation depends on consumer response to advertising, consumer response to retailer promotions, retailer inventory carrying cost, and retailer passthrough behavior. For example, we find that retailer carrying costs and promotion wearout play a central role in constraining expenditures on trade promotions. We predict that as trade promotions are designed <b>to</b> eliminate <b>forward</b> <b>buying,</b> manufacturers will find it in their interest to promote more steeply. We also find a natural tendency for advertising and trade dealing to substitute for each other in an optimal plan. advertising, promotion, marketing mix, product policy...|$|R

These fluctuations allow firms <b>to</b> benefit from <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> (buying for future demand {{in addition to}} current demand) when prices are low. We propose a combined heuristic to determine the optimal number of future periods a firm should purchase at each ordering opportunity {{in order to maximize}} total expected profit when there is uncertainty in future demand and future buying price. We compare our heuristic with existing methods via simulation using real demand data from BlueLinx, a two-stage distributor of building products. The results show that our combined heuristic performs better than any existing methods considering <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> or safety stock separately. We also compare our heuristic to the optimal inventory management policy by full enumeration for a smaller data set. The proposed heuristic is shown to be close to optimal. This study is the first to decide both the optimal number of future periods <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> for uncertain purchase price and the appropriate purchasing quantity with safety stock for uncertain demand simultaneously. The experience suggests that the proposed combined heuristic is simple and can be very beneficial for any company where <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> is possible.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the empirical}} demand data for fast moving consumer goods {{to measure the}} Bullwhip-effect. The data consist of the sell-in from a large manufacturer to the retailers and the sell-out from a retailer to the consumers. Our findings show that the Bullwhip-effect can be substantial. Indeed, in more than 50 % of the cases, the demand upstream (sell-in) is twice as variable as the demand downstream (sell-out). However, in other cases it can be negligible (and in one case, the demand upstream is slightly less variable than the demand downstream). So, while the Bullwhip-effect can be very large, it need not be so. Finally, we attempted to delve into the dynamics that generate a significant Bullwhip-effect and discovered that among the various causes that create the Bullwhip-effect discussed by Lee et al. (1997 a), price fluctuations and <b>forward</b> <b>buys</b> driven by sales targets play a decisive role. We show that the flatter the final consumer demand (sell-out), the more room there is for the retailers <b>to</b> <b>forward</b> <b>buy</b> in order <b>to</b> {{take advantage of the}} deals offered by the manufacturer's sales force {{toward the end of the}} sales period. On the contrary, the more variable the final consumer demand, the less willing the retailer is to make a risky inventory investment and, thus, the more the retailer's orders closely follow consumer demand. This result at the product family level is very consistent with the results that Cachon et al. (2007) obtained at the company/industry leve...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a huge}} {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} uncertainty on trade levels. One very strong result of that literature is that uncertainty should not matter, as long as well developed forward markets exist. The empirical implications of this result, however, are hard to find in the data. We model terms of trade uncertainty in a small open economy with uncertainty stemming from abroad and derive the equilibrium demand for forward contracts. It turns out that risk averse agents will not <b>buy</b> <b>forwards</b> at an actuarially fair price, thus rendering both the full-hedge theorem and the separation theorem of the afore-mentioned literature obsolete. Using real world data for Germany we calibrate our model. We find that in equilibrium risk averse agents will <b>buy</b> <b>forward</b> cover only for investment reasons. The amount of forwards purchased is around 20 % of equilibrium imports. This is broadly in accordance with empirical observed ratios. ...|$|R
