25|$|Manchester terriers are {{considered}} by most {{to be the}} oldest of all identifiable terrier breeds, finding mention in works dating from {{as early as the}} 16th Century. In 1570, Dr. Caius (Encyclopedia of Dogs) gives mention to the black and tan terrier, though he referred to a rougher-coated, shorter-legged dog <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now accustomed to.|$|E
25|$|Buddhists {{accept the}} {{existence}} of beings in higher realms, known as devas, but they, like humans, {{are said to be}} suffering in samsara, and not particularly wiser <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> In fact the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the deities, and superior to them. Despite this they do have some enlightened Devas in the path of buddhahood.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{scientists}} consider these {{fears about the}} dangers of METI as panic and irrational superstition; see, for example, Alexander L. Zaitsev's papers. Biologist João Pedro de Magalhães also proposed in 2015 transmitting an invitation message to any extraterrestrial intelligences watching us already {{in the context of the}} Zoo Hypothesis and inviting them to respond, arguing this would not put us in any more danger <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> already if the Zoo Hypothesis is correct.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{evolution}} is when distantly related species independently evolve similar {{solutions to the}} same problem. For example, fish, penguins and dolphins have each separately evolved flippers {{as a solution to}} the problem of moving through the water. What has been found between dogs and humans is something less frequently demonstrated: psychological convergence. Dogs have independently evolved to be cognitively more similar to humans <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to our closest genetic relatives. Dogs have evolved specialized skills for reading human social and communicative behavior. These skills seem more flexible – and possibly more human-like – than those of other animals more closely related to humans phylogenetically, such as chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes. This raises the possibility that convergent evolution has occurred: both Canis familiaris and Homo sapiens might have evolved some similar (although obviously not identical) social-communicative skills – in both cases adapted for certain kinds of social and communicative interactions with human beings.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
500|$|The {{conductor}} Vernon Handley, long {{associated with}} Bax's music, {{commented that the}} composer's influences include Rachmaninoff and Sibelius as well as Richard Strauss and Wagner: [...] "He was aware of jazz and many more composers on the European scene <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now. That finds its way into a person's psyche and personality and into his technique as a musician." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1843, the Farmer's Magazine {{published}} a petition signed by bankers, salesmen, butchers, aldermen and City residents against further {{expansion of the}} meat market, arguing that livestock markets had been systematically banned since the Middle Ages {{in other areas of}} London: Our ancestors appear, in sanitary matters, to have been wiser <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> There exists, amongst the Rolls of Parliament of the year 1380, a petition from the citizens of London, praying – that, {{for the sake of the}} public health, meat should not be slaughtered nearer than [...] "Knyghtsbrigg", under penalty, not only of forfeiting such animals as might be killed in the [...] "butcherie", but of a year's imprisonment. The prayer of this petition was granted, audits penalties were enforced during several reigns.|$|E
500|$|Red Bull Racing {{used the}} first {{practice}} session {{to test the}} [...] "aeroscreen", a form of cockpit protection developed in response to fatal accidents of the drivers such as Ayrton Senna, Jules Bianchi, Justin Wilson and Henry Surtees, who were struck on the head by flying debris. The aeroscreen was developed {{as an alternative to}} the [...] "halo" [...] device trialled by Ferrari during pre-season testing. The device was fitted to Daniel Ricciardo's car and he completed a single installation lap to assess it before it was removed for the remainder of the session. Ricciardo was satisfied with the device, saying: [...] "Where we have the structure in place is pretty much where the mirrors are so I wouldn't say it hindered any more <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now in terms of visibility.

500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or {{have any kind of}} relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false. Here's this gigantic machine that's a million years further advanced <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> Now, how the hell can we possibly deal with this? On what level? As the story developed, everything worked until the very end. How do you resolve this thing? If humans can defeat this marvelous machine, [...] it's really not so great, is it? Or if it really is great, will we like those humans who do defeat it? Should they defeat it? Who is the story's hero anyway? That was the problem. We experimented with all kinds of approaches...we didn't {{know what to do with}} the ending. We always ended up against a blank wall.|$|E
500|$|Benfica {{began the}} year with a match against Vitória de Setúbal. After trouble {{penetrating}} Setúbal's defense, Mantorras scored in the 71th minute. However, Setúbal rallied and tied the game for a point. The result surprised Camacho: [...] "I though we would win. After we scored, we did not retained the ball. A team like Benfica has to do that." [...] Two Benfica players, Luisão and Katsouranis, had a disagreement during the game; they were immediately substituted, and later suspended. On 12 January, Benfica hosted Leixões at the Luz. They struggled to control Leixões, who had {{the upper hand in}} a scoreless draw. Camacho was disappointed: [...] "We lacked focus; it's apparent since the Champions League elimination that we do." [...] A week later, Benfica played Feirense in the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, advancing to the next round on a 52nd-minute goal by Cardozo. Camacho said, [...] "I did not like the game. We are playing differently <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> training. The difference in quality between both teams should have been obvious and it was not." [...] On 26 January, Benfica played Vitória de Guimarães at the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques. They scored in the eighth minute, when Cardozo converted a free kick from 30 meters out. Di María assisted Maxi Pereira on a second goal, with Guimarães scoring in the 60th minute. In extra time, Cardozo scored his second goal on a mistake by Nilson.|$|E
