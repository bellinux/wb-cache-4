25|$|Similarly, in 1996, member {{countries}} of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed {{to a number of}} exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by <b>the</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority.</b> Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances. Nonetheless, many {{children under the age of}} 13 do work, even in the most developed {{countries of the}} EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.|$|E

Although he missed the practices of the old rites, especially some gestures such as the kissing of the paten (a small plate, usually made of silver or gold, used to hold Eucharistic bread), he prohibited his devotees to ask for any dispensation for him [...] "out of a spirit of obedience to ecclesiastical norms... He has decided to show his love for the liturgy through the new rite", commented Echevarría. However, when Msgr. Annibale Bugnini, Secretary of the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy, learned of Escrivá's difficulties, he granted Escrivá the possibility of celebrating the Mass using the old rite. Whenever Escrivá celebrated this rite, he did so only in the presence of one Mass server.|$|E

To grant approval, the AICTE had sought, among other documents, a certificate in a particular format from the sub-divisional magistrate or collector or tehsildar. The format was the certification that [...] "the land and the building are fit {{to be used for}} running a technical institution". But the tehsildar's office claimed that the land stood in the name of M/s Key Tech. It also stated that it was not <b>the</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> to issue a certificate as prescribed by the AICTE as per the rules. Since PCT failed to submit the required certificate, its application was rejected by the AICTE. PCT then moved the Bombay High Court. The court ruled in PCT's favour, saying that since the trust was not at fault for not producing the certificate, the AICTE should process its application without it. The trust was then asked to submit an affidavit stating the conditions in the certificate.|$|E

A general provision of October 1970 determined in detail {{the circumstances in which}} <b>the</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority</b> must take action {{on the basis of the}} act on the technical means of work. The requirement also stipulated the extent to which the technical standards established by national and international organisations can be regarded as “rules of the art.” In a directive of 10 November 1970, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs recommended to the higher authorities for work protection of the [...] "Lander" [...] to bring in the directive published, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour, by the German Engineers' Association on the evaluation of work station noise in relation to loss of hearing, in order to improve safeguards for workers against the noises in question. In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved. In August 1971, a law came into force directed at reducing atmospheric pollution from lead compounds in four-stroke engine fuels. As a safeguard against radiation, a decree on the system of authorisations for medicaments treated with ionizing radiation or containing radioactive substances, in its version of 8 August 1967, was remodelled by a new Decree of 10 May 1971 which added some radionuclides to the list of medicaments which doctors in private practice were authorized to use.|$|E
