40|$|Realization of high-definition {{multimodal}} displays is keenly {{required for}} the advancement of information and communications technologies. As an index of high-definition display systems, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of presence has been widely investigated. Both theoretically and empirically such sense has been found to relate more dominantly to background components contained in a scene. In contrast, the appreciative role of foreground components in multimodal contents has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, we have been focusing on <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of verisimilitude as another index. We recently studied how <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of verisimilitude and <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of presence were affected by temporal asynchrony between foreground audio-visual components of a Japanese garden and suggested that <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of verisimilitude has significantly different characteristics from <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of presence. To investigate whether this result would be valid more generally, we conducted an experiment using other audio-visual content, namely, a clip of western orchestral music. Results showed <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of verisimilitude is more sensitive to audiovisual synchronicity than to display size, while <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of presence is more sensitive to spatial size than the temporal property. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of verisimilitude can be another useful index, distinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of presence...|$|R

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that <b>the</b> <b>senses</b> were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with <b>the</b> <b>senses</b> and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E

5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from <b>the</b> <b>senses.</b> Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading primers written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through <b>the</b> <b>senses.</b>|$|E

5|$|Clement {{begins the}} fourth {{book with a}} belated {{explanation}} of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives {{a brief description of}} his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing {{that they do not have}} sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent whether any believing Christian can become a martyr by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father – their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of <b>the</b> <b>senses.</b> God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, <b>the</b> <b>senses,</b> consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to <b>the</b> <b>senses,</b> {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>senses</b> of Psittacosaurus can be {{inferred}} from the endocast. Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where <b>the</b> <b>senses</b> were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E
