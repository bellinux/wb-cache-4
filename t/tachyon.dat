5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect relevance to physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears {{as the little}} group of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since <b>tachyon</b> states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E

Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a <b>tachyon</b> pulse generator that will separate the Surfer from it, while Doom devises a machine whose function he keeps secret. In the Black Forest, the Surfer confronts Sue and reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the Fantastic Four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia, where they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where he informs her that his master, known by the people of his world as Galactus, is a massive cloud-like cosmic entity that feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a homing beacon summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus, who will otherwise destroy the Surfer's planet.|$|E

25|$|Mathematically, the Higgs {{field has}} {{imaginary}} mass {{and is therefore}} a tachyonic field. While tachyons (particles that move faster than light) are a purely hypothetical concept, fields with imaginary mass have come {{to play an important}} role in modern physics. Under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories — the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals (there is no violation of causality). Instead of faster-than-light particles, the imaginary mass creates an instability: Any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic must spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons. This process is known as <b>tachyon</b> condensation, and is now believed to be the explanation for how the Higgs mechanism itself arises in nature, and therefore the reason behind electroweak symmetry breaking.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} years, {{hundreds}} of physicists worked {{to complete the}} bootstrap program for this model, with many surprises. Veneziano himself discovered that for the scattering amplitude to describe the scattering of a particle that appears in the theory, an obvious self-consistency condition, the lightest particle must be a <b>tachyon.</b> Miguel Virasoro and Joel Shapiro found a different amplitude now understood {{to be that of}} closed strings, while Ziro Koba and Holger Nielsen generalized Veneziano's integral representation to multiparticle scattering. Veneziano and Sergio Fubini introduced an operator formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes that was a forerunner of world-sheet conformal theory, while Virasoro understood how to remove the poles with wrong-sign residues using a constraint on the states. Claud Lovelace calculated a loop amplitude, and noted that there is an inconsistency unless the dimension of the theory is 26. Charles Thorn, Peter Goddard and Richard Brower went on to prove that there are no wrong-sign propagating states in dimensions {{less than or equal to}} 26.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} condensation of closed string <b>tachyons</b> in nonsupersymmetric spacetimes. Closed string <b>tachyons</b> signal instabilities of the spacetime background which make perturbation theory around the chosen vacuum inconsistent. Non-perturbative techniques developed in studying supersymmetric geometries provide a powerful {{set of tools}} with which to re-examine the classic problem of closed string <b>tachyons.</b> Such approaches allow remarkably controlled and complete descriptions of the condensation of closed string <b>tachyons</b> in a broad class of non-supersymmetric theories. The text begins {{with a discussion of}} closed string <b>tachyons</b> in non-supersymmetric orbifolds of AdS 5 × S 5, using the orbifolded dual CFT to study non-perturbative features of the tachyonic instabilities in the orbifolded spacetime. We then discuss localized closed string <b>tachyons</b> in orbifolds of flat space which break spacetime supersymmetry only at isolated curvature singularities. Using worldsheet and D-probe techniques to follow these systems beyond perturbation theory, we show that these localized <b>tachyons</b> resolve the spacetime as they condense, leading generically to smooth and asymptotically supersymmetric spacetimes. Finally, we discuss a proposal for removing these instabilities from the perturbative string which is motivated by our results on non-supersymmetric orbifolds of the AdS /CFT correspondence...|$|R

25|$|String theory {{eventually}} {{made it out}} of the dustbin, but for the following decade all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees. Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joel Scherk, and David Olive realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a <b>tachyon,</b> and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and Michael Green in 1984. The same year, Alexander Polyakov gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, Daniel Friedan showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the Einstein equations of general relativity, emerge from the renormalization group equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theories—IIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices.|$|E

During the events of Inhumanity, Janet {{returns to the}} Microverse to rescue a family who has been pulled there through a newly awakened Inhuman's powers. There she confronts Gouzar once more, before returning to normal space. In the Avengers Unity Squad's fight with the Horsemen of Death, the Wasp defeats both the resurrected Banshee and Sentry, utilizing both her ability to grow to giant size as well as her ability to control insect life. After the team is defeated and the Earth destroyed, Wasp is the last surviving human and begins a romance with Havok (Alex Summers) with whom she has a daughter named Katie. Years later on Planet X, she is captured when she and Havok destroy a <b>tachyon</b> dam preventing time travel to their era. They are able to undo the destruction of Earth by forming an alliance with Kang and projecting their minds back into their past selves (physical time-travel still being impossible) but Kang takes their daughter to a place outside of time to 'protect' her from the changes in history, Kang subsequently attempts to use Katie as a hostage to force Havok to stop attacking him when he tries to take the Celestial power for himself, departing with Katie as his prisoner. Although Alex is left disfigured after the battle, he and Janet remain together.

We define interactions of particles and <b>tachyons</b> in terms of elastic head-on collisions and energy-momentum conservation. To compare the theory developed with existing relativistic theories, <b>tachyons</b> are studied at first in a Minkowski universe, and the causality of a superluminal communication process is analyzed.
