5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this dust is 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring became one of <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> features in the Uranian ring system.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{precipitation}} estimation {{based on}} weather radar data {{suffers from a}} variety of errors. During stratiform events, a region of enhanced reflectivity, called <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band, leads to large positive biases in the precipitation estimates when compared with ground measurements. The identification of <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band is an important step when trying to correct weather radar data for this effect. In this study we investigate three different methods to identify <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band from profiles measured by a vertically pointing K-Band Micro Rain Radar (MRR). The first tries to fit a piecewise linear function to <b>the</b> profile. <b>The</b> <b>bright</b> band characteristics are then derived from the fitted function parameters. The second uses only reflectivity information, while the third makes additional use of the falling velocity, which is also measured by the MRR. This last method shows the greatest skill in identifying <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band height, followed by the function fit and the pure reflectivity methods. A comparison with data from a scanning radar shows that the height estimated in this way corresponds well with <b>the</b> <b>bright</b> band features observed in the radar scan...|$|R
