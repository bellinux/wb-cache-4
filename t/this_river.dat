5|$|East of Porus' kingdom, {{near the}} Ganges River, were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal {{region of the}} Indian subcontinent). Fearing the {{prospect}} of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. <b>This</b> <b>river</b> thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.|$|E
5|$|The size of Trunajaya's {{forces is}} uncertain. VOC-Mataram reports {{put the number}} at 1,000, but later, Trunajaya's uncle Pangeran Sampang said that Trunajaya's {{followers}} numbered 14,500 just before the assault on Kediri. This force included hundreds of cavalry with chain armour. Trunajaya also built fortifications along the Brantas (Kediri is on the east bank of <b>this</b> <b>river),</b> and his artillery generally outgunned the loyalists.|$|E

5|$|Vaitarni/Vaitarna (to be crossed): It is a {{river that}} is {{believed}} to lie between Naraka and the earth. <b>This</b> <b>river,</b> which forms the boundary of Naraka, is filled with excreta, urine, pus, blood, hair, nails, bones, marrow, flesh and fat, where fierce aquatic beings eat the person's flesh. As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, a person born in a respectable family – kshatriya (warrior-caste), royal family or government official – who neglects his duty is thrown into <b>this</b> <b>river</b> of hell. The Vishnu Purana assigns it to the destroyer of a bee-hive or a town.|$|E
5|$|Rifting {{started to}} create the Gulf of California far to the south 6 to 10million years ago. Around the same time, {{the western edge of}} the Colorado Plateau may have sagged slightly. Both events changed the {{direction}} of many streams toward the sagging region and the increased gradient caused them to downcut much faster. From 5.5million to 5million years ago, headward erosion to the north and east consolidated these streams into one major river and associated tributary channels. <b>This</b> <b>river,</b> the ancestral Lower Colorado River, started to fill the northern arm of the gulf, which extended nearly to the site of Hoover Dam, with estuary deposits.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>river</b> {{crossing}} {{takes the}} two roads into Bass River Township, Burlington County, where US 9 merges off the Garden State Parkway. The route heads northwest onto two-lane undivided New York Road through woods, intersecting the northern terminus {{of the northern}} segment of Route 167. At this point, the route turns north and comes to a junction with CR 542. US 9 turns east into residential New Gretna before crossing under the Garden State Parkway without an interchange and passing over the marshy Bass River. This section runs along {{the eastern edge of}} the heavily forested Pine Barrens, with occasional areas of development.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once <b>this</b> <b>river</b> flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>river</b> {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, {{it was clear that}} the breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin had been successful and the XX Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode was ordered to begin its attack, supported by an artillery barrage, against the well-defended Ottoman front line. The attacks continued until midday on 21 September, when a successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area towards the River Jordan crossing at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge before the rearguard at Nablus was captured. The Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel advanced through the gap provided by the infantry on 19 September to almost encircle the fighting in the Judean Hills, capturing Nazareth, Haifa, Afulah, Beisan, Jenin and Samakh, before advancing to Tiberias. During this time, Chaytor's Force commanded by Major General Edward Chaytor captured part of the retreating Ottoman and German column at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge to cut this line of retreat across the Jordan River. To the east of <b>this</b> <b>river,</b> as the Fourth Army began its retreat, Chaytor's Force advanced to capture Es Salt on 23 September. Amman was captured on 25 September during the Second Battle of Amman when a strong Fourth Army rearguard was defeated there on 25 September.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike most {{rivers of}} Perm Krai, whose {{toponymy}} {{is considered to}} be Permic, the names of rivers of Upper Mulyanka and Lower Mulyanka came from the Persian word [...] "mullah". The researchers of history of Perm Krai connect it with Tatarian prince Mametkul, who settled in the region before or during the reign of Ivan the Terrible and was an imam, or mullah. His elder son, Urak-bey Mametkulov, lived at the Upper Mulyanka, and the younger son, Irak-bey Syundyuk-bey Mametkulov lived at the Lower Mulyanka. So came the names of <b>this</b> <b>rivers</b> and the villages Verkhniye Mully (meaning, 'The Upper Mullahs') and Nizhniye Mully ('The Lower Mullahs'), respectively. More old Pre-Turkic names of <b>this</b> <b>rivers</b> were lost.|$|R
