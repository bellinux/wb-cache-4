Another Tu-142 was converted to replace the Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test bed to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to <b>test</b> <b>a</b> theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E

He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the Trinity <b>test.</b> <b>A</b> few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E

While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E

She joined the fleet on 17 June 1893, {{but she was not}} fully ready for service until 1894. In 1895 she was used to <b>test</b> <b>a</b> new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P.
