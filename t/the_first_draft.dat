5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly. After <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> was written, he set the poem aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place.

5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} wrote <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>draft</b> of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues {{for a date}} of early 1793. It is also unclear {{whether or not a}} French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.|$|E
