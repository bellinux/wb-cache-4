Before touring the school to view the many improvements since his tour as commandant in 1967, Deatrick attended a mission briefing presented by current TPS commandant, Colonel Charles Webb Jr. Deatrick was especially pleased to find that TPS students now receive a Master of Science degree in flight <b>test</b> <b>engineering</b> upon graduation.|$|E
25|$|When reading {{performance}} figures it {{should always be}} borne in mind that weight, the aerodynamic drag generated by different external fittings, {{the condition of the}} airframe and/or engine, and all sorts of other factors could influence how an aircraft performed. For example, the P-51's laminar flow wings needed to be kept as clean and smooth as possible; even relatively minor damage on the wing leading edges could drastically reduce top speed. The most accurate performance figures for the P-51 came from tests carried out at facilities such as the USAAF's Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Engineering</b> Branch, based at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio and, for the RAF, the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A), based at Boscombe Down. North American Aviation carried out their own performance tests, as did the only other manufacturer of the P-51, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) of Australia.|$|E

25|$|Cooper's {{first flight}} {{assignment}} came in 1950 at Landstuhl Air Base, West Germany, where he flew F-84 Thunderjets and F-86 Sabres for four years. He later became flight {{commander of the}} 525th Fighter Bomber Squadron. While in Germany, he also attended the European Extension of the University of Maryland. Returning to the United States in 1954, he studied for two years at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in Ohio, and in 1956 completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering. Cooper was then assigned to the USAF Experimental Flight Test School (Class 56D) at Edwards Air Force Base in California, and after graduation was posted to the Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Engineering</b> Division at Edwards, where {{he served as a}} test pilot and project manager testing the F-102A and F-106B.

2500|$|In 1957, when Cooper was 30 and a Captain, he was {{assigned}} to Fighter Section of the Experimental Flight <b>Test</b> <b>Engineering</b> Division at Edwards AFB in California. He acted as a test pilot and project manager. On May 3 of that year, he had a crew setting up an Askania Cinetheodolite precision landing system on a dry lake bed. This cinetheodolite system would take pictures at one frame per second as an aircraft landed. The crew consisted of James Bittick and Jack Gettys who began work at the site just before 08:00, using both still and motion picture cameras. According to his accounts, later that morning they returned to report to Cooper that they saw a [...] "strange-looking, saucer-like" [...] aircraft that did not make a sound either on landing or take-off.|$|E
