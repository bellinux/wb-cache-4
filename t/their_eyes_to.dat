5|$|Like most arthropods, spiders lack {{balance and}} {{acceleration}} sensors {{and rely on}} <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> tell them which way is up.

5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E

5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans <b>their</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>To</b> protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E

5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E

40|$|The right brain hemisphere, {{connected}} <b>to</b> {{the left}} <b>eye,</b> coordinates fight and flight behaviors {{in a wide}} variety of vertebrate species. We investigated whether left eye vision predominates in dairy cows’ interactions with other cows and humans, and whether dominance status affects the extent of visual lateralization. Although we found no overall lateralization of <b>eye</b> use <b>to</b> view other cows during interactions, cows that were submissive in an interaction were more likely <b>to</b> use <b>their</b> left <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> view a dominant animal. Both subordinate and older cows were more likely <b>to</b> use <b>their</b> left <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> view other cattle during interactions. Cows that predominantly used <b>their</b> left <b>eye</b> during aggressive interactions were more likely <b>to</b> use <b>their</b> left <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> view a person in unfamiliar clothing in the middle of a track by passing them on the right side. However, a person in familiar clothing was viewed predominantly with the right eye when they passed mainly on the left side. Cows predominantly using <b>their</b> left <b>eyes</b> in cow-to-cow interactions showed more overt responses to restraint in a crush compared with cows who predominantly used <b>their</b> right <b>eyes</b> during interactions (crush scores: left eye users 7. 9, right eye users 6. 4, standard error of the difference = 0. 72). Thus, interactions between 2 cows and between cows and people were visually lateralized, with losing and subordinate cows being more likely <b>to</b> use <b>their</b> left <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> view winning and dominant cattle and unfamiliar humans...|$|R
25|$|The principal, {{anterior}} median, {{eyes have}} high resolution (11 min visual angle), but {{the field of}} vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, {{is no more than}} six or seven receptor rows wide. However, the eye can scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye's scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic adjustment is a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. It is analogous to the way most primates move <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> focus images of interest onto the fovea centralis. Such movements within the jumping spider's eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider is directed to various targets.|$|E
25|$|As {{towns in}} Cavite {{fell into the}} hands of Filipino revolutionaries, the Spanish {{government}} in Madrid felt that Governor General Ramon Blanco's offensive against the natives was ineffective. Thus, a more aggressive person took over the command of the islands, Camilo de Polavieja, with Gen. José de Lachambre {{as the head of the}} campaign. Gradually, the Spaniards regained the control of the province. After the fall of Silang, the Spaniards turned <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> Perez-Dasmariñas. Knowing the strength of resistance he might encounter, Gen. Lechambre decided to surround the whole town. He sent to advance units headed by Brigadier Gen. Jose Molina who went to take the left. The troop under Col. Arutos who had taken Paliparan, went westward to cut the escape of the Filipinos to Imus and Carmona. Gen. Lechambre sent the main force toward the south.|$|E

Amaterasu produces black flames at {{the focal point of the}} user's vision. Once created, it can continue burning for seven days and seven nights. The flames cannot be extinguished with water or any other normal method; only the user can put the flames out. Said to be [...] "the fires from hell" [...] and to burn as hot as the sun itself, Amaterasu burns virtually any material, including other flames, until nothing but ash remains. However, the flames cannot burn through chakra or materials infused with chakra, as they fail to burn into Naruto's Kurama chakra cloak or through Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person. Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks. For more advanced users, they can shape Amaterasu into more specialized configurations. Use of Amaterasu puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> bleed. For all its lethal potential, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body parts before it spreads. Other defensive options are pushing the flames away, absorbing them, certain space–time ninjutsu, or being the host of the Ten Tails.|$|E
