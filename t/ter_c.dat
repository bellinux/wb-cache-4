40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is dedicated to}} the topic of the debtor’s responsibility, considered {{from the point of view}} of its evolution in the contemporary legal experience. Traditionally, the system of debtor’s responsibility had been represented as it was based on two dogmas that seemed to be insuperable. The first one identify itself in uniqueness and indivisibility of the estate and in the universal patrimonial liability principle ex article 2740 c. c. of the Italian Civil Code, destined to give out only in peremptory cases established by the law. The second one is represented by the nullity of conventional limitations of debtor’s patrimonial liability. Within this framework, it was not only often affirmed that all debtor’s assets are included into the generic patrimonial guarantee and that its limitations are exceptions, having residual character that only the law can establish, but it was also precluded to the private autonomy to interfere with this institution. The article 2740 c. c. seems to confirm this reconstruction, that, however, must be confronted with the normative evolution, that is from several years directed towards the opposite direction. This evolution is especially due to the proliferation of the cases in which the law allows to the same subject to have more than one estate, that had put into crisis the idea according to which the debtor must guarantee his fulfilment with all his assets. The objective of this thesis is to rebuild the new boundaries of debtor’s patrimonial liability, taking into account legal innovations, as well as doctrinal and jurisprudential evolution. The first question to be answered by this study regards to the effectiveness of the dogmas that are traditionally considered the foundations of the whole system, trying to verify if they were really imposed by insuperable principles or if our system has always had the basis to suggest a different key of interpretation. This work is dedicated in its first part to exploring the concept of patrimonial liability in its historical developments up to the present codification. Within this thesis’ part would be explained the reasons why this institution is considered one of the most important pillars of our legal system and it would be put the basis to a different reading key of the system, occasioned also by the comparison with the approach to the theme of segregated found developed in Scotland and Québec. In the second part of this work it would be explored some examples of segregated founds that are present in our legal system, as fondo patrimoniale (articles 167 c. c.); patrimoni destinati a uno specifico affare (articles 2447 bis c. c.) and atto di destinazione ex article 2645 <b>ter</b> <b>c.</b> c. In this way it would be possible to verify how they had contribute to the evolution of the system and it would be possible to determine the new boundaries of debtor’s patrimonial liability. The last part of this thesis is dedicated to exploring the dogma that determined the nullity of conventional limitations of debtor’s patrimonial liability, whose legal basis is represented by Article 2740, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. The fundamental problem is to understand if this dogma had been really imposed by this rule or if it was dictated by doctrinal elaboration. From this point of view, the analysis wants to verify if the reasons that make it necessary the typicality principle of segregated found remain valid also for conventional limitations of debtor’s patrimonial liability. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{abstract}} Judicial Control of Private Autonomy in Separation and Divorce 	The theme herein examined {{is that of}} {{the discipline}} of estate relationships between spouses during the breakdown phase of marriage, when the interest in settling the state of the personal separation or mending the effects of marriage dissolution arises. Beginning from the consideration that in our system separation and divorce are necessarily obtained through recourse to the judicial authority, the investigative perspective must therefore be that of verifying the relationship between the controlling power of the judge and the spouses’ power over their own estate. In other words, the said research intends to identify the limits of spousal private autonomy with respect to the judicial intervention. 	Following such logic, the basis of the norms upon which rests the actors’ right to establish contractual agreements that define the crisis itself is examined. Moreover, a brief survey of the civil code norms is permitted, norms which recognise the great availability spousal power in the healthy phase of marriage, as well as reference to the new constitutional foundation of the family, which continues to designate greater space to the forming of contractual agreements in the family sphere. It also became apparent that if the necessary location for the autonomous negotiations of the spouses is the trial, this depends on the fact that in our system, notwithstanding attempts by the doctrine to substantiate its validity, prenuptial agreements are not permitted, that is, agreements between spouses intended to privately and pre-emptively order the effects of separation and divorce. Unlike Common Law Countries which allow prenuptial agreements in contemplation of divorce, the Italian Supreme Court declares them null and void for reason of unlawful cause. For this reason, all legislative proposals that advocate such an introduction of prenuptial agreements with modification to the civil code have been examined. 	The investigation of the relationship between judicial control and private autonomy of the spouses has been articulated in two sections. 	The first develops the theme while considering the situation in which, despite being in conflict with one another, the spouses reach a consensual separation (or divorce {{in the case of a}} combined request). Once the function and structure of the particular proceedings related to separation and divorce have been clarified (necessary elements of the status), associated with the essential characteristic of being voluntary judicial proceedings, one reaches the first conclusion which is that in this setting the margins of private autonomy externalisation are very broad. For this reason, they are permitted to establish real and proper contracts, conferring or establishing rights with which one carries out estate settlement directed towards regulating the rights and obligations which arise from separation and divorce. In this setting particular focus was given to the agreements deriving from real estate conveyances (or the establishment of property rights), both between the spouses as well as for the benefit of minor children, confronting problems related to the formal appropriateness of the separation record, and its appropriateness in constituting title for the deed registration. Other than the formal aspect the more complex theme of the causal justification of the conveyances and the assignments between spouses in the trial setting was examined. The doctrinal contributions to the notion of cause of contract, even in the light of the most recent theories were analysed, as well as the jurisprudence standing, one which has finally recognized an anonymity under the causal profile in such a conferment. The generally notable matter within the discipline which is connected to this particular case is present under the fiscal profile as well, that being the facilitation of applicable taxation dependent on the link between the acts of title conferment and transfer, and the “cause of divorce and separation”. 	Aside from looking at the acts of title conferment and transfer, the research has pondered other types of negotiation acts and other institutions used to define the crisis with the aim of guaranteeing the fulfillment of alimony and child support obligations. Divorce Court decrees which brought acts such as the ex art. 2645 <b>ter</b> <b>c.</b> c. into effect were examined, on the presumption that the foundation of the obligation correspond to the interests of worthy expenses. Attempts have also been made to explain the reasons for which the estate fund institution 167 c. c., despite displaying ties relating to real estate, registered property and credit documents in the interest of the family, is insufficient in satisfying the needs that arise in the breakdown phase of marriage. One needs only think of the fact that the fund ceases with the divorce and that even if it does not dissolve with the separation it remains difficult to ponder joint spousal administration with the best interests of the family in mind, a family which is suffering conflict at such a point of disintegration. Upon these bases the institution of the trust in common law has also been examined, one through which the settlor transfers the title of goods to a trustee who administers and manages it in the interest of a beneficiary. The trustee thus becomes the owner, whose ownership of the conferred goods in trust remains separate and unaffected by the executive actions of the personal creditors of the trustee. A situation arises in which the formal owner is the trustee, while the corresponding rights to the property are held by the beneficiary. These essential characteristics always increasingly justify the undertaking of the institution in the area of family crises in which the duty to deliver could be functional both for the obligation of alimony payments, as well as for guaranteeing the habitable destination of the family property in the interests of the children. Even with reference to the act of constitution of the trust the judge explains its control function while evaluating the respect for the imperative norms of domestic law at the time of constitution. 	The second part of the research is instead concentrated on the hypothesis that when the spouses in conflict do not reach an agreement on the definition of the estate relationships between them, the judge must adopt all the measures of which art. 155 speaks: custody; support (for the children as well as for the spouse). In this case the judicial protection of rights expands to define every necessary and relevant question with regards the new separation regime of the family is dissolution. The measures of judicial authority are adopted according to the mechanisms of contentious proceedings, and are subject to the rules of customary procedure after an initial judge-presided phase that allows for the adoption of temporary and urgent measures that remain in place until the final decision is made. Given the juridical and social relevance of the ‘family home’, the research has concentrated in particular on the presumptions, nature and the effects of the measures regarding the assignment of the spousal home in the case of legal separation, ex art. 155 quarter cc [...] Since it is a measure with the function of protecting the minors in custody, and is of a financial nature, its indirect effects on the regulation of the economic relationship between the parents by the judge in the contentious separation have been considered. 	Lastly, with the prospect of verifying the relationship between judicial protection of the family home and the negotiating power of the property’s legal owner, apart from the particular case in which the deed of assignment intervenes following the conferment – a case which is resolvable according to the rules of registration – the problems related to the efficiency of the legal assignment with respect to the legal relationships already in existence for the house that is used as the family residence have been examined. The common hypothesis {{is that of the}} house being ceded on loan by the parents who are legal owners to the child while they live with the family. However, a crisis then emerges and so contentious separation proceedings occur and the judge assigns the wife exclusive enjoyment of the property since she holds custody of the minor child ex art. 155 quater c. c [...] The theme has been confronted on the basis of the most recent guidance of the Supreme Court after the intervention of United Sectors in 2004. ...|$|E

In vitro, we performed further study, using RAW 264. 7 cells and Caco- 2 cells, to confirm the molecular mechanisms of TER on inflammatory response. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, TER alleviated DSS-induced disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening, colonic pathological damage, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities. The production of pro-inflammatory mediators was significantly decreased by TER. Furthermore, TER inhibited NF-κB and NLRP 3 inflammasome activation. Surprisingly, TER reduced the plasmatic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration and re-balanced Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Lactobacillus levels. In addition, TER prevented the impairment of colon epithelium barrier by regulating the expression of zonula occludens- 1 and occludin. In vitro, the results showed that TER significantly suppressed NLRP 3 inflammasome activation in LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells, as indicated by decreased expression of NLRP 3 and caspase- 1, and lowered interleukin- 1 β secretion. In contrast, mice deficient for NLRP 3 were less sensitive to DSS-induced acute colitis, and TER treatment exerted little protective effect on DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in NLRP 3 −/− mice. The protective effect of TER may be largely attributed to its inhibition of NLRP 3 inflammasome activation in colon.

Four, which consist of c. 249 _ 252 delGTCT (deletion at codons 83 - 84), c. 1546 _ 1547 insC (insertion at codon 516), c. 1378 C>T (Arg 460 <b>Ter),</b> and <b>c.</b> 628 _ 631 delACAG (deletion at codons 210 - 211) have been reported to occur frequently in 4. 5 %, 2. 7 %, 2. 6 %, and 2. 5 % of families, respectively. However, a comparison of the clinical features in patients and their families with the same mutations reveals an absence of phenotype-genotype correlations. The majority of MEN 1 mutations are likely to disrupt the interactions of menin with other proteins and thereby alter critical events in cell cycle regulation and proliferation...|$|R

40|$|Directional cell {{motility}} {{is essential}} for normal development and physiology, although how motile cells spatiotemporally acti-vate signaling events remains largely unknown. Here, we have characterized an adhesion and signaling unit comprised of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) -PEST and the extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion receptor 8 integrin that plays essential roles in directional cell motility. 8 integrin and PTP-PEST form protein complexes {{at the leading edge}} of migrating cells and balance patterns of Rac 1 and Cdc 42 signaling by controlling the subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of Rho GDP dissoci-ation inhibitor 1 (RhoGDI 1). Translocation of Src-phosphorylated RhoGDI 1 to the cell’s leading edge promotes local activation of Rac 1 and Cdc 42, whereas dephosphorylation of RhoGDI 1 by integrin-bound PTP-PEST promotes RhoGDI 1 release from the membrane and sequestration of inactive Rac 1 /Cdc 42 in the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data reveal a finely tuned regulatory mechanism for controlling signaling events at the leading edge of directionally migrating cells. The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family consists oftransmembrane and cytoplasmic members that catalyze the dephosphorylation of protein substrates to regulate cell growth, migration, and other processes in development and disease (1, 2).

40|$|ABSTRACT-The genetic {{basis of}} a germ cell deficiency, ac-companied by a high {{incidence}} of testicular teratomas, was studied in strain 129 /Sv-ter mice (formerly designated " 129 /terSv"). Germ cell deficiency became more severe with advancing age in males, and they were sterile whether or not they had bilateral teratomas. Germ cell-deficient testes were smaller than normal except when the testes had teratomas. In females the ovaries were smaller than normal, but the germ cell deficiency did not progress and most were fertile. The germ cell deficiency resulted from the homo-zygous state of a recessive mutant gene designated "teratoma (ter). " Matings between females with small ovaries and homozygous normal males produced no germ cell-deficient offspring. When F 1 offspring with normal gonads were mated together, germ cell-deficient F 2 animals appeared at a frequency close to 1 in 4. When females with small ovaries (ter/ter) were mated with heterozygous males (ter/+), half of the offspring were germ cell deficient. It was concluded that the genetic factor is a single recessive gene. The incidence of teratomas in +/+ strain 129 /Sv-ter males was 1. 4 % (3 / 216), and all teratomas were unilateral. Seventeen percent (20 / 117) of heterozygous males had teratomas, of which 18 were unilateral and 2 were bilateral. Ninety-four percent (167 / 178) of homozygous ter/ter males had teratomas, of which 75 % were bilateral.

We compared the effect of DFAIII with that of sodium caprate (C 10), a well-known enhancer of TJ permeability, on the changes in TJ proteins, transport of paracellular markers, and effects of nine cellular signaling blockers using Caco- 2 monolayers. The addition of DFAIII (0 - 100 mmol/L) and C 10 (0 - 10 mmol/L) to the apical medium of the Caco- 2 monolayers dose-dependently decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), which is an indicator of TJ permeability. The reduction with C 10 was much faster than that with DFAIII. Transport of the paracellular markers of various molecular weights (182 - 43, 200) was elevated {{by the addition of}} 100 mmol/L DFAIII and 10 mmol/L C 10. The transport rates were much in the presence of C 10 than of DFAIII, while the reduction in TER by two treatments was similar (from 1000 to 300 Omega cm(2)). Treatment with DFAIII and C 10 changed the distribution of actin filament and claudin- 1, but not occludin, junctional adhesion molecule- 1, or zonula occludens- 1; however, alterations in the patterns of the TJ proteins differed according to treatment.

40|$|AERA. Dream {{machines}} and computing practices at the Mathematical Center  Dream machines {{may be just}} as effective as the ones materialised. Their symbolic thrust can be quite powerful. The Amsterdam ‘Mathematisch Centrum’ (Mathematical Center), founded February 11, 1946, created a Computing Department in an effort to realise its goal of serving society. When Aad van Wijngaarden was appointed as head of the Computing Department, however, he claimed space for scientific research and computer construction, next to computing as a service. Still, the computing service following the five stage style of Hartree’s numerical analysis remained a dominant chara <b>c</b> <b>ter</b> istic of the work of the Computing Department. The high level of ambition held by Aad van Wijngaarden lead to ever renewed projections of big automatic computers, symbolised by the never-built AERA. Even a machine that was actually constructed, the ARRA which followed A. D. Booth’s design of the ARC, never made it into real operation. It did serve Van Wijngaarden to bluff his way into the computer age by midsummer 1952. Not until January 1954 did the computing department have a working stored program computer, which for reasons of policy went under the same name: ARRA. After just one other machine, the ARMAC, had been produced, a separate company, Electrologica, was set up for the manufacture of computers, which produced the rather successful X 1 computer. The combination of ambition and absence of a working machine lead to a high level of work on programming, way beyond the usual ideas of libraries of subroutines. Edsger W. Dijkstra in particular led the way to an emphasis on the duties of the programmer within the pattern of numerical analysis. Programs generating programs, known elsewhere as autocoding systems, were at the ‘Mathematisch Centrum’ called ‘superprograms’. Practical examples were usually called a ‘complex’, in Dutch, where in English one might say ‘system’. Historically, this is where software begins. Dekker’s matrix complex, Dijk stra’s interrupt system, Dijkstra and Zonneveld’s ALGOL compiler – which for housekeeping contained ‘the complex’ – were actual examples of such super programs. In 1960 this compiler gave the Mathematical Center a leading edge in the early development of software...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} spatial {{complexity}} and dynamic na- ture, floodplains provide {{a wide range}} of ecosystem func- tions. However, because of flow regulation, many river- ine floodplains have lost their characteristic heterogeneity. Restoration of floodplain habitats and the rehabilitation of key ecosystem functions, many of them linked to organic carbon (C) dynamics in riparian soils, has therefore become a major goal of environmental policy. The fundamental un- derstanding of the factors that drive the processes involved in C cycling in heterogeneous and dynamic systems such as floodplains is however only fragmentary. We quantified soil organic C pools (microbial <b>C</b> and wa- <b>ter</b> extractable organic <b>C)</b> and fluxes (soil respiration and net methane production) in functional process zones of ad- jacent channelized and widened sections of the Thur River, NE Switzerland, on a seasonal basis. The objective was to assess how spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of these pools and fluxes relate to physicochemical soil proper- ties on one hand, and to soil environmental conditions and flood disturbance on the other hand. Overall, factors related to seasonality and flooding (tem- perature, water content, organic matter input) affected soil C dynamics more than soil properties did. Coarse-textured soils on gravel bars in the restored section were character- ized by low base-levels of organic C pools due to low TOC contents. However, frequent disturbance by flood pulses led to high heterogeneity with temporarily and locally increased C pools and soil respiration. By contrast, in stable riparian forests, the finer texture of the soils and corresponding higher TOC contents and water retention capacity led to high base- levels of C pools. Spatial heterogeneity was low, but major floods and seasonal differences in temperature had additional impacts on both pools and fluxes. Soil properties and base levels of C pools in the dam foreland of the channelized sec- tion were similar to the gravel bars of the restored section. By contrast, spatial heterogeneity, seasonal effects and flood dis- turbance were similar to the forests, except for indications of high CH 4 production that are explained by long travel times of infiltrating water favoring reducing conditions. Overall, the restored section exhibited both a larger range and a higher heterogeneity of organic C pools and fluxes as well as a higher plant biodiversity than the channelized section. This suggests that restoration has indeed led to an increase in func- tional diversity...|$|R

Foi realizado levantamento sócio-econômico e foram pesquisados os sinais e sintomas apresentados pelos pacientes e seus contatos com águas naturais.

40|$|Abstract-Galanin {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout {{the central nervous system}} with multiple and diverse biological roles. In the rat, galanin-like immunoreactivity is expressed in a population of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT, serotonin) neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) with extensive projections to the forebrain areas e. g., hippocampus. The major aim of the thesis was to study in vivo, whether porcine galanin can modulate 5 -HT transmission with focus on 5 -HT 1 A receptors associated with the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. This analysis was performed at both the pre- and postsynaptic level of the DR projection using behavioural, neurochernical and molecular approaches. The effects of porcine galanin were examined in the adult male rat following intraventricular (i. c. v.) administration. Galanin given i. c. v. to the rat 10 min or 2 h prior to training, dose-dependently (0. 3 - 3 nmol) attenuatedthe deficit in passive avoidance (PA) induced by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 2 mg/kg) mediated via activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in cortico-limbic brain regions. The shortterm(10 min) and prolonged (2 h) reduction in the postjunctional 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated response at I <b>ter</b> i. <b>c.</b> v. galanin was not associated with changes in the mRNA levels or agonist binding properties of cortico-limbic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. These results suggest that an acute increase of galanin transmission in vivo can counteract limbic 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated responses without significantly affecting gene expression or binding properties of 5 -HT 1 A receptors. In the DR, galanin (3 nmol/rat) increased the KD values of 5 -HT 1 A receptors at 10 min but not 2 It and 5 h after administration while an increase in the Bmax values was seen at 2 h but not at 10 min and 5 h after administration. The mRNA levels of 5 -HT 1 A receptors and of galanin in the DR were significantly decreased at 2 h but not 5 h after galanin. These findings provide evidence for time-dependent, modulatory actions of galanin on 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the DR, possibly partly via galanin- 5 -HT 1 A receptor interactions (formation of galanin/ 5 -HT 1 A receptor heteromeric complexes) and partly via galanin transduction mechanisms in the DR. Galanin given i. c. v. was found to produce a long-lasting (> 5 h) reduction in basal 5 -HT release in the ventral hippocampus. The inhibitory effect of galanin was related to a galanin receptor activation (blocked by a galanin receptor antagonist M 35) at the level of DR. I. c. v. galanin 2 h after administration decreased mRNA levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (the rate limiting enzyme in synthesis) in the DR. 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 3 mg/kg, s. c.) caused a reversible reduction of extracellular 5 -HT levels which was almost completely blocked by i. c,v. galanin (0. 5 nmol and partially by 0. 15 nmol). Thus, although both galanin and 8 -OH-DPAT alone reduced basal hippocampal 5 -HT release, their simultaneous administration did not exhibit any synergistic effects. Galanin also attenuated S-OH-DPAT induced hypothermia and locomotor activity in rats, functional effects mediated via postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in neuroantomical different projections. Antidepressant drug action has been related to desensitisation of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. The ability of three " 5 -HT related drugs" to alter 5 -HT 1 A receptors was examined after repeated treatments (14 days). Fluoxetine (a 5 -HT uptake blocker) treatment significantly increased the KD values in dorsal raphe, CA 1 and dentate gyrus (DG). 8 -OH-DPAT, did not affect the KD values in any of the areas tested while robalzotan (a 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist) increased the KD values in the DR. Both 8 -OH- DPAT and robalzotan but not fluoxetine decreased the Bmax values of the postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the DG and CAI areas of the dorsal hippocampal formation without affecting the Bmax values of these receptors in the DR. Furthermore, fluoxetine and robalzotan but not 8 -OH-DPAT treatment also increased the mRNA levels of the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the CAI area without affecting the mRNA levels of the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in DG and DR. None of the treatments changed the mRNA levels of the neuropeptide galanin, which coexists with 5 -HT in the DR. The results from the forced swim test (FST) showed that all three drugs tested caused "antidepressant-like" effects. The modulatory actions on 5 - HT 1 A receptors caused by the three " 5 -HT related drugs", can be interpreted as a result of enhanced 5 -HT transmission. Furthermore, the anti depre ssant- like effects in the FST appear to involve multiple adaptive changes in 5 -HT 1 A receptor mechanisms. In conclusion, the present studies have shown that galanin is a potent in vivo inhibitor of mesencephalic cortico-limbic 5 -HT neurotransmission involving strong interactions between galanin and 5 -HT 1 A receptors. In view of these findings, galanin antagonists may represent a new therapeutic principle in depression...|$|R

As a citizen, the unionist knows that the collective bargaining of the commercial enter-prise cannot be transplanted to the hospital. The constructive right to strike, the bedrock of union life and power can be self-destructive. Slowdowns, work stoppages in a hospital can become matters of life and death. No responsible unionist can, there-fore 3 talk of strikes or slowdowns in relation to hospitals. Collective bargaining itself assumes a different meaning in the hospital atmosphere. In the commercial enterprise, production pace, assignment of work and the many other myriad aspects of profit making are open to discussion between management and union. There is little parallel in the hospital. This is the problem. TJith the growth of unions in the community and the benefits of dignity and security which unionism bestows upon the 0 union member, the hospital employee naturally seeks the same status and in the same manner. On the other hand, the hospital is not comparable to the shop, the factory, the warehouse, the retail store. Union leadership in Toledo feels that reasonable men acting as citizens first and managers and unionists second can resolve this problem. It is further hoped that J| this may be a Toledo contJribution to the national problem of unionization of hospitals. Toledo Unions accept the statement of the Toledo Hospitals that Union membership will not be the basis for discrimination.
