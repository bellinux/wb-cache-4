40|$|Recently, machine {{learning}} algorithms have successfully entered large-scale real-world industrial applications (e. g. search engines and email spam filters). Here, the CPU cost during test time must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper, we address the challenge of balancing the test-time cost and the classifier accuracy in a principled fashion. The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by the computation required for feature extraction-which can vary drastically across eatures. We decrease this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. By only computing features for inputs that benefit from them <b>the</b> <b>most,</b> <b>our</b> cost sensitive tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current state-of-the-art at {{a small fraction of}} the computational cost...|$|E

We have calculated both a global disclosure index and different partial disclosure indices relating to the areas of interest of the main stakeholders: the study reveals that Italian universities achieve a satisfactory rate in disclosing information relating to research and teaching activities.

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol {{incorporates}} emissions trading, {{joint implementation}} and the clean development mechanism to help Annex 1 countries {{to meet their}} Kyoto targets at a lower overall cost. Using a global model based on the marginal abatement costs of 12 countries and regions, this paper estimates {{the contributions of the}} three Kyoto flexibility mechanisms to meet the total greenhouse gas emissions reductions required of Annex 1 countries under the three trading scenarios respectively. Our results clearly demonstrate that the fewer the restrictions on the use of flexibility mechanisms the gains from their use are greater. The gains are unevenly distributed, however, with Annex 1 countries that have the highest autarkic marginal abatement costs tending to benefit <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> results also indicate that restrictions on the use of flexibility mechanisms not only reduce potential of the Annex 1 countries’ efficiency gains, but also are not beneficial to developing countries because they restrict the total financial flows to developing countries under the clean development mechanism. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{a new model of}} opinion dynamics in which agents interact with each other about several distinct opinions/contents. In most of the literature about opinion dynamics, agents perform convex combinations of other agents' opinions. In our framework, a competition between opinions takes place: agents do not exchange all their opinions with each other, they only communicate about the opinions they like <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> model uses scores to take this competition into account: each agent maintains a list of scores for each opinion held. Opinions are selected according to their scores (the higher its score, the more likely an opinion is to be expressed) and then transmitted to neighbors. Once an agent receives an opinion it gives more credit to it, i. e. a higher score to this opinion. Under this new framework, we derive a convergence result which holds under mild assumptions on the way information is transmitted by agents and leads to consensus in a particular case. We also provide some numerical results illustrating the formation of consensus under different topologies (complete and ring graphs) and different initial conditions (random and biased towards a specific content...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a dynamic partial {{equilibrium}} model in order to explain the search behaviour of low-skilled non employed workers, when their employability decreases as the unemployment spell lengthens. We show that the unemployed react to a reduction in their current search effectiveness by decreasing their search efforts, and react to an expected future reduction in search effectiveness by increasing their present search efforts, to exploit <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>our</b> of good times. We then separately analyze active and passive labor market policies, consisting in training programs and income support schemes. We show that it is optimal for the government to include among the eligibility criteria for subsidized training a minimum length of the unemployment spell. However, workers should be recruited before they become discouraged and stop searching. We also show that for broad range of the parameters the optimal income support scheme takes the form of unemployment benefits granted for a limited amount of time starting {{from the beginning of the}} unemployment spell, coupled with social assistance for long-term unemployed with very limited residual employability. decreasing employability, human capital deterioration, income support, poverty, search, training, unemployment benefits...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust, adaptive method for animating dynamic visco-elastic deformable objects {{that provides a}} guaranteed frame rate. Our approach uses a novel automatic space and time adaptive level of detail technique, in combination with a largedisplacement (Green) strain tensor formulation. The body is partitioned in a non-nested multiresolution hierarchy of tetrahedral meshes. The local resolution is determined by a quality condition that indicates where and when the resolution is too coarse. As the object moves and deforms, the sampling is refined to concentrate the computational load into the regions that deform <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> model consists of a continuous differential equation that is solved using a local explicit finite element method. We demonstrate that our adaptive Green strain tensor formulation suppresses unwanted artifacts in the dynamic behavior, compared to adaptive mass-spring and other adaptive approaches. In particular, damped elastic vibration modes are shown to be nearly unchanged for several levels of refinement. Results are presented {{in the context of}} a virtual reality system. The user interacts in real-time with the dynamic object through the control of a rigid tool, attached to a haptic device driven with forces derived from the method. ...|$|E

We contend that {{it is not enough to}} identify which school resources matter the most, but that it would be more informative for policy purposes to identify which student types may benefit the most from the provision of a given school resource. This way, we may be able to target our allocations toward more productive educational investments. Using quantile regression analysis, we find that in the case of Palawan, improvements in pupil-teacher and pupil-toilet ratios may benefit high-performing schools the most. We also find that class size and pupil-room ratio improvements, along with the provision of guidance counselors and science laboratories, may benefit low-performing schools <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> results also give some evidence that conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) procedures may be both insufficient and imprecise in estimating education production functions, and that educational policies based on least squares methods alone may be misguided if not accompanied by other techniques, such as quantile regression, which can offer more valuable insights into education production processes in general.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{transmission}} {{models are}} essential to design and evaluate control strategies for airborne infections. Our objective {{was to develop a}} dynamic transmission model for seasonal influenza allowing to evaluate the impact of vaccinating specific age groups on the incidence of infection, disease and mortality. Projections based on such models heavily rely on assumed ‘input’ parameter values. In previous seasonal influenza models, these parameter values were commonly chosen ad hoc, ignoring between-season variability and without formal model validation or sensitivity analyses. We propose to directly estimate the parameters by fitting the model to age-specific influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence data over multiple influenza seasons. We used a weighted least squares (WLS) criterion to assess model fit and applied our method to Belgian ILI data over six influenza seasons. After exploring parameter importance using symbolic regression, we evaluated a set of candidate models of differing complexity according to the number of season-specific parameters. The transmission parameters (average R 0, seasonal amplitude and timing of the seasonal peak), waning rates and the scale factor used for WLS optimization, influenced the fit to the observed ILI incidence <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> results demonstrate the importance of between-season variability in influenza transmission and our estimates are in line with the classification of influenza seasons according to intensity and vaccine matching...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in cognitive alterations during the early course of schizophrenia. From a clinical perspective, a better understanding of cognitive functioning in putative at-risk states for schizophrenia is essential for developing optimal early intervention models. Two approaches have more recently been combined to assess the entire course of the initial schizophrenia prodrome: the predictive "basic symptom at-risk" (BS) and the ultra high-risk (UHR) criteria. Basic symptoms are considered to be present during the entire disease progression, including the initial prodrome, while the onset of symptoms captured by the UHR criteria expresses further disease progression toward frank psychosis. The present study investigated the cognitive functioning in 93 subjects who met either BS or UHR criteria and thus were assumed to be at different points on the putative trajectory to psychosis. We compared them with 43 patients with a first episode of psychosis and to 49 help-seeking patient controls. All groups performed significantly below normative values. Both at-risk groups performed at intermediate levels between the first-episode (FE) group and normative values. The UHR group demonstrated intermediate performance between the FE and BS groups. Overall, auditory working memory, verbal fluency/processing speed, and declarative verbal memory were impaired <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> results suggest that cognitive impairments may still be modest {{in the early stages of}} the initial schizophrenia prodrome and thus support current efforts to intervene in the early course of impending schizophrenia because early intervention may prevent or delay the onset of frank psychosis and thus prevent further cognitive damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} mixture on {{productivity}} {{has been widely}} studied for applications related to agriculture but results in forestry are scarce due {{to the difficulty of}} conducting experiments. Using a modeling approach, we analyzed the effect of mixture on the productivity of forest stands composed of sessile oak and Scots pine. To determine whether mixture had a positive effect on productivity and if there was an optimum mixing proportion, we used an aggregation technique involving a mean-field approximation to analyze a distance-dependent individual-based model. We conducted a local sensitivity analysis to identify the factors that influenced the results <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> model made it possible to predict the species proportion where productivity peaks. This indicates that transgressive over-yielding can occur in these stands and suggests that the two species are complementary. For the studied growth period, mixture does {{have a positive effect on}} the productivity of oak-pine stands. Depending on the plot, the optimum species proportion ranges from 38 to 74 % of oak and the gain in productivity compared to the current mixture is 2. 2 % on average. The optimum mixing proportion mainly depends on parameters concerning intra-specific oak competition and yet, intra-specific competition higher than inter-specific competition was not sufficient to ensure over-yielding in these stands. Our work also shows how results obtained for individual tree growth may provide information on the productivity of the whole stand. This approach could help us to better understand the link between productivity, stand characteristics, and species growth parameters in mixed forests. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) enhances cancer cell adhesion to normal microvessels, we used in vivo video microscopy to measure adhesion rates of MDA-MB- 435 s human breast cancer cells and ErbB 2 -transformed mouse mammary carcinomas in the postcapillary venules of rat mesentery. An individual postcapillary venule in the mesentery was injected via a glass micropipette with cancer cells {{either in a}} perfusate of mammalian Ringer solution containing 1 % bovine serum albumin as a control, or {{with the addition of}} 1 nm VEGF for test measurements. Cell adhesion was measured as either the number of adherent cells or the fluorescence intensity of adherent cells in a vessel segment for ∼ 60 min. Our results showed that during both control and VEGF treatments, the number of adherent cells increased almost linearly with time over 60 min. The VEGF treatment increased the adhesion rates of human tumour cells and mouse carcinomas 1. 9 -fold and 1. 8 -fold, respectively, over those in control conditions. We also measured cancer cell adhesion after pretreatment of cells with an antibody blocking VEGF or an antibody blocking α 6 integrin, and pretreatment of the microvessel with VEGF receptor (KDR/Flk- 1) inhibitor, SU 1498, or anti-integrin extracellular matrix ligand antibody, anti-laminin- 5. All antibodies and inhibitor significantly reduced adhesion, with anti-VEGF and SU 1498 reducing it <b>the</b> <b>most.</b> <b>Our</b> results indicate that VEGF enhances cancer cell adhesion to the normal microvessel wall, and further suggest that VEGF and its receptor, KDR/Flk- 1, as well as integrins of tumour cells and their ligands at the endothelium, contribute to mammary cancer cell adhesion to vascular endothelium in vivo...|$|E
