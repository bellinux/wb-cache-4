In November 1995, the duo pledged {{to dissolve the}} K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> {{for a period of}} 23 years, but Drummond spoke about <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> in 2000 and 2004.

5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> local <b>burning</b> {{velocity}} and <b>the</b> flame displacement speed are the dominant {{properties in the}} mechanism of turbulent premixed combustion. The flame displacement speed and <b>the</b> local <b>burning</b> velocity have been investigated separately, because the flame displacement speed {{can be used for}} the discussion of flame-turbulence interactions and <b>the</b> local <b>burning</b> velocity can be used for the discussion of the inner structure of turbulent premixed flames. In this study, to establish the basis for the discussion on the effects of turbulence on the inner structure of turbulent premixed flames, the indirect relationship between the flame displacement speed and <b>the</b> local <b>burning</b> velocity was investigated by the flame stretch, the flame curvature, and the tangential strain rate using DNS database with different density ratios. It was found that for the local tangential strain rate and the local flame curvature, <b>the</b> local <b>burning</b> {{velocity and}} <b>the</b> flame displacement speed had the opposite correlations in each density ratio case. Therefore, it is considered that <b>the</b> local <b>burning</b> velocity and <b>the</b> flame displacement speed have a negative correlation...|$|R

40|$|Four {{erosive burning}} models, {{equations}} (11) to (14). are developed {{in this work}} by using a power law relationship to correlate (1) <b>the</b> erosive <b>burning</b> ratio and <b>the</b> local velocity gradient at propellant surfaces; (2) <b>the</b> erosive <b>burning</b> ratio and <b>the</b> velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity; (3) <b>the</b> erosive <b>burning</b> difference and <b>the</b> local velocity gradient at propellant surfaces; and (4) <b>the</b> erosive <b>burning</b> difference and <b>the</b> velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity. These models depend on the local velocity gradient at the propellant surface (or the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity) only and, unlike other empirical models, are independent of the motor size. It was argued that, since <b>the</b> erosive <b>burning</b> is a local phenomenon occurring near {{the surface of the}} solid propellant, <b>the</b> erosive <b>burning</b> ratio should be independent of the bore diameter if it is correlated with some local flow parameters such as the velocity gradient at the propellant surface. This seems to be true considering the good results obtained by applying these models, which are developed from the small size 5 inch CP tandem motor testing, to CFD simulations of much bigger motors...|$|R
