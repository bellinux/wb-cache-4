5|$|By January 2011, {{much of the}} nation's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} from the Gascoyne flood to the devastating floods in Queensland. Many residents struggling to get their lives back together were frustrated {{with the government and}} demanded aid. <b>Though</b> <b>people</b> affected by the floods were to be given A$15,000 in funds, they expressed further anger after hearing that residents in Queensland would receive A$25,000. On 11 January, Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that the imbalance in funds was to be corrected and residents of Western Australia would receive equal amounts to those in Queensland. By 20 January, donations for flood victims from the Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund exceeded A$1million. Power restoration, especially in Gascoyne Junction, was unusually sluggish. Dozens of residents were without power for eight weeks, as electricity was finally restored between 12 and 13 February. This coincided with the arrival of replacement furniture from Paraburdoo; however, heavy rains renewed flooding and prevented most residents from picking up the supplies.|$|E

The boycott was lifted in South Korea starting in 1998.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} plans have been introduced that would raise the age of Medicare eligibility. Some have argued that, as the population ages and the ratio of workers to retirees increases, programs for the elderly need to be reduced. Since {{the age at which}} Americans can retire with full Social Security benefits is rising to 67, it is argued that the age of eligibility for Medicare should rise with it (<b>though</b> <b>people</b> can begin receiving reduced Social Security benefits as early as age 62).|$|E

25|$|The blood atonement {{doctrine}} was {{the impetus}} behind {{laws in the}} territory and state of Utah allowing capital punishment by firing squad or decapitation. <b>Though</b> <b>people</b> in Utah were executed by firing squad for capital crimes {{under the assumption that}} this would aid their salvation, there is no clear evidence that Young or other top theocratic Mormon leaders enforced blood atonement for apostasy or non-capital crimes like miscegenation. There is, however, some evidence that the doctrine was enforced a few times at the local church level without regard to secular judicial procedure. The rhetoric of blood atonement may have contributed to a culture of violence leading to the Mountain Meadows massacre.|$|E
500|$|The {{layout of}} city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman, and remarked that the streets were designed by [...] "drunken Irishmen". He later apologized, <b>though</b> <b>people</b> had been complaining about the fractured grid system {{for more than a}} century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.|$|E
500|$|Gardiner played junior {{ice hockey}} with the Winnipeg Tigers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) for three seasons, from 1921 to 1924. He joined the Selkirk Fishermen senior {{team for the}} 1924–25 season. The Fishermen played in the highest amateur league in Manitoba and were finalists for the {{championship}} the year before. Gardiner appeared in 18games for Selkirk, posting two shutouts and a 1.83goals against average. They again reached the finals but lost to the Port Arthur Bearcats. The loss made Gardiner feel dejected and ashamed, <b>though</b> <b>people</b> assured him he had played well and had several offers for different teams. He decided to join the professional Winnipeg Maroons of the Central Hockey League (CHL). As {{he would be a}} professional, Gardiner was forced to give up his baseball career, which he was reluctant to do; he finished with a career batting average of [...]300. Playing two seasons in Winnipeg, Gardiner appeared in 74games, posting 12shutouts, and 2.14 and 2.16goals-against average in the two seasons, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Less than 15 {{hours before}} the {{scheduled}} July 2 execution, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities—including Bundy's mental competency to stand trial, and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6–6 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty—that, ultimately, were never resolved. A new date (November 18, 1986) was then set {{to carry out the}} Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17. In mid-1988 the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Bundy, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling. Within hours of that final denial a firm execution date of January 24, 1989 was announced. Bundy's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: [...] "Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy {{as fast as they could}} ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. <b>Though</b> <b>people</b> everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was actually on the fast track." ...|$|E
500|$|Released on June 7, 2005, the {{collection}} has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five, praising {{the quality of}} the episodes included in the set, but ultimately finding that they were best viewed {{in the context of the}} [...] "standalone" [...] episodes which were omitted—singling out [...] "Conduit" [...] and [...] "The Jersey Devil" [...] as episodes which would aid the series' [...] "dual character study". Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated {{the collection}} eight out of ten, finding that the mythology-based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze", not included in the collection, he added that [...] "even <b>though</b> <b>people</b> watched the series to see little green men and liver-eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success". However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough [...] "to keep us from complaining". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that [...] "whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1: Abduction is a must". Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking [...] "should you buy Abduction? It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you, because chances are, if you love the X-Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once".|$|E
