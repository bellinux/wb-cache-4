5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century, the chronically high {{inflation}} was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, the Turkish new lira (Yeni Türk Lirası) in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy. In 2009, after only four years in circulation, the Turkish new lira was renamed back to the <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> with the introduction of new banknotes and coins (and the withdrawal of the Turkish new lira banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005), but the ISO 4217 code of the Turkish new lira (TRY) remains in use for the current <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> in the foreign exchange market.|$|E
25|$|The Guinness Book of Records {{ranked the}} <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> as the world's least {{valuable}} currency in 1995 and 1996, and again from 1999 to 2004.

25|$|After {{periods of}} the lira pegged to the British pound and the French franc, a peg of 2.8 <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> = 1 U.S. dollar was adopted in 1946 and {{maintained}} until 1960, when the currency was devalued to 9 <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> = 1 dollar. From 1970, {{a series of}} hard, then soft pegs to the dollar operated as {{the value of the}} <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> began to fall.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, the {{imports of}} the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus were 2,067,457,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras,</b> whilst the exports were 758,453,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras.</b> In 1980, the imports were 7,086,008,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras</b> and the exports were 3,345,262,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{compensation}} package allocated by the Turkish Assembly {{was only}} 60 million <b>Turkish</b> <b>liras.</b> While 12.7 million <b>Turkish</b> <b>liras</b> {{were given to}} churches for compensation out of 39 million <b>Turkish</b> <b>liras</b> claimed for damages, {{the rest of the}} 60 million <b>Turkish</b> <b>liras</b> was distributed among applicants.|$|R

25|$|Northern Cyprus {{uses the}} <b>Turkish</b> <b>Lira</b> as its {{currency}} which links its economy {{to that of}} Turkey's. Since the Republic of Cyprus joined the Euro zone {{and the movement of}} peoples between the north and south has become more free, the Euro is also in wide circulation. Exports and imports have to go via Turkey; while European Union promised an opening up of the ports after the Annan plan, this was blocked by the Republic of Cyprus and exporting through the south, while technically possible, remains impractical.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} permits {{were given}} to another British company, and another ceremony was held announcing the resumption of works in March 1895. The new British contractor, Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, restored the Jezreel dike and construction resumed. However, in 1900, the Ottomans began building the Hejaz railway, and saw the opportunity to convert the future Haifa–Damascus line to an extension thereof. In addition, because of financial disputes between the Ottoman authorities and DHP, and DHP's delaying of transporting construction materials for the Haifa line through their own railways, the Ottomans wanted {{to have their own}} railway line to the Mediterranean. In 1902, the Ottoman authorities revoked S.O.R.'s permit for a compensation of 155,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira.</b>|$|E

5|$|VAT {{signed a}} {{contract}} to sell 200 lorries to Turkey in 1959. The first two vehicles were shipped from Finland in 1959 but the contract was terminated in an embarrassing way because the Bank of Finland refused to take <b>Turkish</b> <b>liras</b> in payment.|$|R
50|$|In September 1955 {{during the}} anti-Greek Istanbul Pogrom, the offices and the {{printing}} establishments {{of the newspaper}} were completely wrecked by the fanatical mob.

25|$|Despite the {{constraints}} {{imposed by the}} lack of international recognition, the nominal GDP growth rates of the economy in 2001–2005 were 5.4%, 6.9%, 11.4%, 15.4% and 10.6%, respectively. The real GDP growth rate in 2007 was estimated at 2%. This growth has been buoyed by the relative stability of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>Lira</b> and a boom in the education and construction sectors. Between 2002 and 2007, Gross National Product per capita more than tripled, from US$4,409 in 2002 to US$16,158 (in current U.S. dollars). The growth continued through the 2010s, with real growth rates of 3.7%, 3.9%, 1.8% and 1.1% respectively in 2010–2013. The unemployment rate declined through the 2010s and was at 8.3% in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is commemorated by many {{memorials}} throughout Turkey, {{such as the}} Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, the Atatürk Bridge {{over the}} Golden Horn (Haliç), the Atatürk Dam, and Atatürk Stadium. Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him. His face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; his portrait {{can be seen in}} all public buildings, in all schools and classrooms, on all school books, on all <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. At the exact time of his death, on every 10 November, at 09:05am, most vehicles and people in the country's streets pause for one minute in remembrance.|$|E
25|$|The Özal {{strategy}} {{called for}} import-substitution policies {{to be replaced}} with policies designed to encourage exports that could finance imports, giving Turkey a chance {{to break out of}} the postwar pattern of alternating periods of rapid growth and deflation. With this strategy, planners hoped Turkey could experience export-led growth over the long run. The government pursued these goals by means of a comprehensive package: devaluation of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>lira</b> and institution of flexible exchange rates, maintenance of positive real interest rates and tight control of the money supply and credit, elimination of most subsidies and the freeing of prices charged by state enterprises, reform of the tax system, and encouragement of foreign investment. In July 1982, when Özal left office, many of his reforms were placed on hold. Starting in November 1983, however, when he again became prime minister, he was able to extend the liberalization program.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{the global}} oil crisis of 1973 meant {{bad news for}} the STC-16. Not only car fuel became more expensive, but the cost of {{building}} fiberglass (which is a petrochemical product) car bodies such as that of the STC-16 also skyrocketed. The rear-wheel drive STC-16's engine consumed a lot of fuel, and the sport coupé market in Turkey appealed to a very small segment, particularly to the young members of high-income families. Unlike other Anadol models of that period which were sold for 50,000 to 55,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras,</b> the STC-16 had a price tag of more than 70,000 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras.</b> When all these factors came together, the primary customers of the STC-16 remained the rally drivers, sports car enthusiasts and young celebrities.|$|R
40|$|Many {{market and}} {{non-market}} {{goods and services}} are generated via erosion control activities. Prices of market goods and services are readily available and are regarded as indicators of their value. However, to determine the monetary value of non-market goods and services, special valuation methods such as Contingent Valuation Method, BenefitTransfer Method, Hedonic Pricing Method and Choice Experiments Method need to be used. This study attempts to estimate the values of four non-market benefits (namely, postpone of flood occurrence, prevention of soil erosion, increase dam life and increase access to spring water) generated via the Çakıt Stream Basin Erosion Control Project executed in Adana and Niğde Provinces of Turkey. The marginal values of these benefits were estimated via Choice Experiments Method. A customized face-to-face survey was conducted among 300 respondents {{in order to meet}} the data requirements of this evaluation method. The basin residents’ willingness to pay for the examined benefits was determined via an assessment of the collected data using Multinomial Logit Model. The results reveal that, respondents would pay for one year postpone of flood occurrence; 4. 43 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras</b> for one percent prevention of soil erosion; - 0. 25 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras</b> one year increase for dam life; and 2. 13 <b>Turkish</b> <b>Liras</b> one percent increase for access to spring water...|$|R
