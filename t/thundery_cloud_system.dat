In this paper, we introduce the concept of software-defined IoT units – a novel approach to IoT cloud computing that encapsulates fine-grained IoT resources and IoT capabilities in well-defined APIs {{in order to provide}} a unified view on accessing, configuring and operating IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> Our software-defined IoT units are the fundamental building blocks of software-defined IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> We present our framework for dynamic, on-demand provisioning and deploying such software-defined IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> By automating provi-sioning processes and supporting managed configuration models, our framework simplifies provisioning and enables flexible run-time customizations of software-defined IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> We demonstrate its advantages on a real-world IoT <b>cloud</b> <b>system</b> for managing electric fleet vehicles.

Two different cloud simulations were run with faster and slower ice fall speeds to compare to the original control test.

The strategy of GCSS is to use two distinct kinds of models to analyze and understand observations of the behavior of several different types of <b>clouds</b> <b>systems.</b> Cloud-system models are models with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to represent individual cloud elements, but covering a wide enough range of space and time scales to permit statistical analysis of simulated <b>cloud</b> <b>systems.</b> These models are compared with detailed observations, representing several specific cases taken from field experiments, and with statistical composites obtained from satellite and meteorological analyses. Single-column models represent the column physics of an atmospheric general circulation model and are used to test cloud parameterizations in an un-coupled mode by comparison with field data and statistical composites. GCSS has five Working Groups, which deal with boundary-layer clouds, cirrus clouds, extratropical layer <b>cloud</b> <b>systems,</b> precipitating deep convective <b>cloud</b> <b>systems,</b> and polar <b>clouds,</b> respectively.

The rawinsonde network was much more extensive and the <b>cloud</b> <b>system</b> was relatively slow moving and well-located with respect to the enhanced sounding network and the National Weather Service (NWS) Wind Profiler Network. In addition to the rawinsonde soundings (1200 and 1800 UTC on 25 Nov. and 0000 and 0600 UTC on 26 Nov.) and satellite observations, four aircraft sorties were flown in the northern portion of this cirrus <b>cloud</b> <b>system</b> from mid-morning to mid afternoon. These included microphysical-radiation profiling missions by the NCAR Sabreliner near Tulsa (about midway between COF and OUN) and the NCAR King Air near Ponca City (about 80 km upwind of Tulsa), a microphysical profiling mission by the UND Citation near Tulsa, and a NASA ER- 2 overflight.
