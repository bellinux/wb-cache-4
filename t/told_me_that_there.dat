500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth".|$|E
500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E
