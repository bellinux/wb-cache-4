Longacre prepared a number of designs; Pollock selected Longacre's design of a shield (similar to the two-cent piece) and a starry circle for the reverse, and the Shield nickel began to be struck that year. [...] Mint Assayer William DuBois wrote to Longacre, [...] "it is truly pleasing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> pass the life of three score and ten and yet {{be able to produce}} the same artistic works as in earlier days." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennox was {{attending}} a benefit held by former South African president Nelson Mandela's 46664 HIV/AIDS campaign in 2003. There {{she was surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> wearing a black t-shirt with the message [...] "I am HIV positive" [...] written in capital letters. She {{found it to be}} a bold statement and inquired about the man, {{who turned out to be}} Zackie Achmat, a South African activist, film director, and co-founder of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). Although the singer had been associated with the 46664 campaign, being introduced to Achmat gave her an opportunity to do more for the campaign and the project.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, {{she opened}} the front door of Kenwood <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who [...] "looked like a tramp", but with her husband's features. He {{explained}} that he was Alfred Lennon, the father whom Lennon had supposedly not seen for years. Lennon was annoyed when he came home, telling {{her for the first time}} that his father had visited the NEMS office, Epstein's business, a few weeks before. Three years after the meeting in the NEMS office, Alfred Lennon (who was then 56 years old) turned up at Kenwood again with his fiancée, 19-year-old student Pauline Jones. He asked if the Lennons could give Pauline a job, so she was hired to help with Julian and the piles of Beatles' fan mail. Lennon's father and his fiancée then spent a few months living in the attic bedroom. During an interview at Kenwood with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon said, [...] "Here I am in my Hansel and Gretel house, famous and loaded, and I can't go anywhere. There's something else I'm going to do, only I don't know what it is, but I do know this isn't it for me".|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and cheese on toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E

Sherman wrote: [...] "His fame {{was then}} at its height, ... and I was very anxious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who had {{achieved}} such feats of daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still wilder Indians of the plains ... I cannot express my surprise at beholding such a small, stoop-shouldered man, with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, {{and nothing to}} indicate extraordinary courage or daring. He spoke but little and answered questions in monosyllables." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elsie {{grew up in}} Waiuku, a {{small town}} south of Auckland, where she {{developed}} a repugnance towards war at an early age. As a young girl, she witnessed the injuries of World War I veterans first hand — [...] "...when visiting Warkworth I was taken <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whose face had been half shot away and who never went off his farm". Though she left Waiuku at a young age, she retained strong ties to the town into her old age, and often returned. Unusually for a Pākehā of her generation, she developed {{a close relationship with}} the local iwi in Waiuku, Ngāti Te Ata, and her later research proved vital to their Treaty of Waitangi claim.|$|E
2500|$|Howard Brennan was a steamfitter who {{was sitting}} {{across the street from}} the Texas School Book Depository and {{watching}} the motorcade go by. He notified police that he heard a shot come from above and looked up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with a rifle fire another shot from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor. He said he had seen the same man minutes earlier looking through the window. Brennan gave a description of the shooter, and Dallas police subsequently broadcast descriptions between 12:45p.m., 12:48p.m., and 12:55p.m. After the second shot was fired, Brennan recalled, [...] "This man I saw previous was aiming for his last shot... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis {{both have}} done soundtracks for documentaries about Johnson. Several hip-hop activists have also {{reflected}} on Johnson's legacy, {{most notably in}} the album The New Danger, by Mos Def, in which songs like [...] "Zimzallabim" [...] and [...] "Blue Black Jack" [...] are devoted to the artist's pugilistic hero. Additionally, both Southern punk rock band This Bike is a Pipe Bomb and alternative country performer Tom Russell have songs dedicated to Johnson. Russell's piece is both a tribute and a biting indictment of the racism Johnson faced: [...] "here comes Jack Johnson, like he owns the town, there's {{a lot of white}} Americans like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> go down... like to see a black man drown." ...|$|E

2500|$|Four {{years before}} the {{assassination}} of President Kennedy, Ruby went <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Lewis McWillie in Cuba. Ruby considered McWillie, who had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, {{to be one of}} his closest friends. At the time Ruby visited him, in August 1959, McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana's Tropicana Club. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie. The House Select Committee on Assassinations would later conclude that Ruby [...] "…most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests." [...] The committee also found [...] "circumstantial," [...] but not conclusive, evidence that [...] "…Ruby met with [...] Santo Trafficante in Cuba sometime in 1959." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flappers were {{associated}} with the use of a number of slang words, including [...] "junk", [...] "necker", [...] "heavy petting", and [...] "necking parties", although these words existed before the 1920s. Flappers also used the word [...] "jazz" [...] in the sense of anything exciting or fun. Their language sometimes reflected their feelings about dating, marriage and drinking habits: [...] "I have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> about a dog" [...] at this period often meant going to buy whiskey; and a [...] "handcuff" [...] or [...] "manacle" [...] was an engagement or wedding ring. Also reflective of their preoccupations were phrases to express approval, such as [...] "That's so Jake",(okay); [...] "That's the [...] ", (a superb person); [...] "Cake-eater," [...] (a ladies' man); and the popular: [...] "the ," [...] (anything wonderful).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{expressions}} include [...] "squirting" [...] and [...] "taking a leak", and, predominantly by younger persons {{for outdoor}} female urination, [...] "popping a squat", {{referring to the}} position many women adopt in such circumstances. National varieties of English show creativity. American English uses [...] "to whiz". Australian English has coined [...] "I am off to take a Chinese singing lesson", derived from the tinkling sound of urination against the China porcelain of a toilet bowl. British English uses [...] "going to see my aunt", [...] "going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> about a dog", [...] "to piddle", [...] "to splash (one's) boots", as well as [...] "to have a slash", which originates from the Scottish term for a large splash of liquid. One of the most common, albeit old-fashioned, euphemisms in British English is [...] "to spend a penny", a reference to coin-operated pay toilets, which used (pre-decimalisation) to charge that sum.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1650s, his {{two great}} interests, ancient {{languages}} {{and the history}} of the Netherlands, led him to begin to study the histories of first the Dutch language, and then the Germanic languages in general. [...] This was not a popular field of study at the time, the historical languages deemed most worthy of academic attention being Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. This shift in interests led to some tension between Van Vliet and several of his old friends, who were not best pleased <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> they esteemed as a Latinist turn to study lesser things; a letter survives from Nicholas Heinsius, who had been a fellow student at Leiden, addressed [...] "to Ulitius, the authority on antiquities both barbarian and scholarly", a veiled criticism which appears not to have gone unnoticed. [...] Despite this tacit disapproval, however, Van Vliet began to study ancient books and manuscripts in various Germanic languages, including English.|$|E
2500|$|About {{a minute}} after the shooting, a woman {{seated next to}} her boyfriend in his car {{on the other side}} of the city park saw a [...] "white male [...] a light-colored, cheap nylon wig" [...] sprint from the park and enter a [...] "small, light-colored" [...] auto, which drove away quickly. [...] "He looks like he just robbed a bank", said the woman, who wrote what she could see of the car's license plate. She was unable to {{determine}} the first two characters, but was certain that the others were either 4-GUR or 4-GVR. Other witnesses included a woman who saw a light car speed away from the park about 20 seconds after the gunshots, and at least two witnesses who described a yellow Volkswagen driving quickly from the neighborhood with its headlights off. A neighborhood resident given the pseudonym Mary Lyons heard the gunshots and Violante's calls for help, and glanced from her apartment window <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> whom she later positively identified as Berkowitz, who was walking casually away from the crime scene as many others were rushing towards the scene to render aid.|$|E
2500|$|Ament was {{subsequently}} released {{at the direction}} of the German military commander, Count Alfred von Waldersee. Wilbur Chamberlin, a reporter for the New York Sun, sent to China, reported in a letter dated 9 February 1901 to his wife:My missionary friend, the Rev. A., is out of limbo....Quite a long time ago he had a scheme for collecting damages for all his native Christians and his church from the Chinese themselves. He went around to some forty villages and collected 80,000 taels. A few days ago he went back there and was promptly arrested at the instigation of some Roman Catholics. It appears they had the same sort of scheme, but A. got there first, and when they went around to these same villages to make their collections, they found out that he had all the money there was. Naturally, they were enraged, so they made complaint against A., and declared that he had been blackmailing the villages....I really think, myself, that A. might have left a little for the Catholics. I don't like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> take it all, even if he is a missionary." [...] Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest.|$|E

2500|$|During the United States' Formalist {{period in}} literature, American writers admired Villa's work. Mark Van Doren wrote in {{reaction}} to Selected Poems and New that it is [...] "...So natural yet in its daring so weird, a poet rich and surprising, {{and not to be}} ignored". Babette Deutsch wrote in The New Republic that Have Come, Am Here reveals that Villa's concern for [...] "ultimate things, the self and the universe. He is also on visiting terms with the world. He is more interested in himself than in the universe, and he greets the world with but a decent urbanity." [...] Although she viewed Villa's range as somewhat narrow, he [...] "soars high and plunges deep". British poet Edith Sitwell revealed in the preface of Villa's Selected Poems and New that she experienced [...] "a shock" [...] upon reading Have Come, Am Here, most notably the poem [...] "#57", [...] "a strange poem of ineffable beauty, springing straight from the depths of Being. I hold {{that this is one of}} the most wonderful short poems of our time, and reading it I knew that I was seeing for the first time the work of a poet with a great, even an astonishing, and perfectly original gift." [...] Meanwhile, noted American poet Garret Hongo described Villa as [...] "one of the greatest pioneers of Asian American literature...our bitter, narcissistic angel of both late Modernism and early post-colonialism." [...] In his introduction to Footnote to Youth, American writer Edward J. O'Brien—who dedicated his collection Best American Short Stories of 1932 to Villa—hailed the poet as [...] "one of a half-dozen American short-story writers who count". [...] Meanwhile, {{in reaction to}} Villa's poems, e.e. cummings wrote, [...] "and i am alive <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> against the sky".|$|E
