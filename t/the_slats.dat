5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of <b>the</b> <b>slats</b> increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of <b>the</b> <b>slats,</b> and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, <b>the</b> <b>slats</b> locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish <b>the</b> <b>slats</b> from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted.

40|$|As one of {{the major}} {{contributors}} to aircraft noise, the noise generated by high-lift devices has been explored for many years. However, the noise related to <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track system, which includes all the extrusive components connecting <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> and <b>the</b> main element, is still generally studied through experimentation due to the complex geometry. In this project, the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track and cut-out, especially the main element cut-out, were investigated through numerical simulations for the first time. Two methods were employed in this work. Noise propagation is first studied via a compact source model to evaluate the contribution of each source individually and to investigate the influence of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track system on the noise propagation in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> region. <b>The</b> APE-IV system was employed but modified by using a more accurate expression of enthalpy perturbation to calculate the acoustic fields. The results show that both <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track system and the background flow modify the sound propagation path. The energy radiated towards the ground is increased due to the interaction of sound waves with <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track system and the background flow. Detached eddy simulations were run to investigate the mechanisms of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track and cut-out noise generation. Major noise sources in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove region are identified and a noise generation feedback loop is proposed. The results show that the increment of noise levels due to the existence of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track system is two-fold. <b>The</b> <b>slat</b> track and <b>the</b> cut-out generate noise individually and they also amplify the noise generated within <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> region when <b>the</b> sound waves propagate though <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove area and interact with <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track and cut-out. The dominant frequencies of the spectrum are seen to shift towards the high frequencies due to these added on components. In this work, two kinds of possible noise attenuation approaches were proposed and studied. Geometries based on replacing the sharp cut-out on the main element leading edge with an edge-rounded or a sealed cut-out have been proved to be able to reduce the cut-out noise significantly. Application of acoustic bulk absorbing material can also attenuate the cut-out noise efficiently for a certain range of frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> {{track and}} cut-out on noise {{propagation}} were investigated using compact source models for a high-lift wing. Two different geometries of the high-lift devices, {{with and without}} <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track and cut-out, were investigated. Convection effects were also considered with the mean flows obtained from precursor simulations of corresponding high-lift configurations. Major noise sources in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove region were modelled with equivalent compact dipoles placed along <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> trailing edge and cusp. Results show that sound propagation is modified by the add-on components. The acoustic waves are amplified significantly and radiate more energy towards the ground due to the interaction between propagating waves and <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track and cut-out. Although the cancellation caused by interference of the radiated and reflected waves happens {{in both of these}} configurations especially in the downwards direction, it is more prominent once sound waves pass <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> track and cut-out. Wave cancellation is also significant when the wavelength is comparable {{to the size of the}} barrier such as the gap between <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> and <b>the</b> main element.

25|$|An {{aspect of}} the type often criticised was the high landing speed imposed by the wing design.

40|$|In {{the case}} of civil {{transport}} aircraft, engines were the dominant noise source until {{the advent of the}} high-bypass ratio engines in the early 1970 s. Since then, airframe noise has become more important, particularly during the approach-to-landing stage of aircraft operations. The main components of airframe noise are the flap side edge, leading edge <b>slat,</b> and <b>the</b> landing gear. Experiments in both the wind tunnel and via fly-over measurements have shown that <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise is a major contributor to the overall airframe noise during the landing approach for a commercial aircraft. To achieve the goal of reducing slat noise significantly without adversely affecting the aerodynamic performance of the wing, it is obligatory to improve the understanding of <b>the</b> mechanism of <b>slat</b> noise generation. Experiments and numerical simulations were performed to investigate <b>the</b> phenomena of <b>slat</b> noise. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> broadband noise generation is governed by two kinds of mechanism. At a low angle of attack of the wing, the typical circulation region is not formed in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove and <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise level is low. As the angle of attack increases to a certain value, vortical structures are intermittently generated due to flow interaction occuring between the shear layer originating from <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cusp and <b>the</b> flow convected from the stagnation line on the main element. Intense slat noise is produced as the vortical structures approach <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove surface. With the angle of attack increasing further, <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise becomes weak again. The interaction effect tends to become weaker as the shear layer deviates away {{from the surface of the}} main element. Two approaches with the aim of attenuating <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise were experimentally and numerically studied. The first approach was to reduce <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise using air blown on the suction surface of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> near its trailing edge. A numerical simulation showed that <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise levels over most of the frequencies, especially above a St number of 7, were obviously attenuated. In the second approach, a strip mounted on the pressure surface of the main element model was experimentally proven to be an effective method for reducing <b>the</b> broadband <b>slat</b> noise at an angle of attack of 8 degrees and a freestream velocity of 25 m/s. The position and height of the strip also influenced the level of the reduction. Several tonal noise components appear in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise spectrum at an angle of attack of 4 degrees and a freestream velocity of 25 m/s. The dominant tone is associated with the vortex shedding off <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cusp through <b>the</b> Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This tone was successfully suppressed using a plasma actuator employing an open-loop control. A maximum reduction of 11 dB was achieved at a St number of approximately 19. 7. A quasi-static feedback control system was also developed, wherein a controller is responsible for calculating the control inputs in terms of ii feedback signals. The experimental results show that the controller can work effectively to suppress <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> noise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between <b>the</b> <b>slats.</b> More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

40|$|This study {{primarily}} {{investigated the}} flow and aeroacoustics associated with <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> of a three-element aerofoil in approach conditions. The study assessed importance of several factors and examined their aerodynamic impacts. The factors investigated were aerofoil incidence, slat angle, slat cusp geometry, fixing transition and blowing in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove. A combination of experimental and computational techniques investigated the factors selected. The experimental work employed PIV, pressure tap, a force balance, flush mounted microphones and an acoustic array. The computational work used DES {{along with the}} FW-H acoustic analogy to obtain the far-field directivity. Tonal features occurred at high incidence and originated at <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> trailing edge, due to the blunt trailing edge and gap, and at the reattachment point.

The crew was, therefore, unaware that <b>the</b> <b>slats</b> on the left wing were retracting. This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing.

We call this new optimization speculative register promotion. Using this technique, a value can be pro- moted to a register and aliased loads and stores to that value's home memory location are caught and the proper fixup is performed. This paper will: a) describe <b>the</b> <b>SLAT</b> hardware and software interface; b) demonstrate that conventional register promotion is often inhibited by static compiler analysis; c) describe the speculative register promotion optimization; and d) show the performance increases possible when a SLAT is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that 2 D, time accurate computations based on a pseudo-laminar zonal model of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove region (within the framework of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) are inadequate for predicting the full unsteady dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove flow field. Even though such computations could capture the large-scale, unsteady vorticity structures in <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove region without requiring any external forcing, the simulated vortices were excessively strong and the recirculation zone was unduly energetic in comparison with the PIV measurements for a generic high-lift configuration. To resolve this discrepancy and to help enable physics based predictions of <b>slat</b> aeroacoustics, <b>the</b> present paper is focused on 3 D simulations of <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> cove flow over a computational domain of limited spanwise extent. Maintaining the pseudo-laminar approach, current results indicate that accounting for the three-dimensionality of flow fluctuations leads to considerable improvement in the accuracy of the unsteady, nearfield solution. Analysis of simulation data points to the likely significance of turbulent fluctuations near the reattachment region toward the generation of broadband <b>slat</b> noise. <b>The</b> computed acoustic characteristics (in terms of the frequency spectrum and spatial distribution) within short distances from <b>the</b> <b>slat</b> resemble <b>the</b> previously reported, subscale measurements of slat noise...|$|R
