What is absolutely unique for this road structure in terms of driving exercise is the way drivers behave inside road tunnel as well as approaching it and exiting from it. The study of human factors related to road tunnel is therefore a huge topic of research. The present paper wants {{to contribute to the}} knowledge of the <b>tunnel</b> effects on <b>driving</b> performance using the advanced technology of driving simulation in virtual reality. An highway scenario with six twin tube tunnels is reproduced in CRISS driving simulator and the longitudinal speed, acceleration and lateral position of twenty drivers are recorded, post processed and compared with the data of a control scenario, driven by the same sample of drivers, that has the same road geometries and alignment of the tunnel scenario, but without any tunnels.

The tunnel was driven within a clear distance of 2 m from the closest pile of a 3 x 4 pile group supporting an expressway. During construction, <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> parameters {{as well as}} induced ground and pile group responses were recorded. To avoid cutting the piles supporting the expressway, the alignment of the tunnel was adjusted and curved. As {{a result of this}} change in tunnel alignment, the tunnel advancing rate was reduced from an average 17 m/day for a straight drive to an average of only 6 m/day for the curved alignment, and the ratio between the tunnel face pressure and overburden pressure was changed from 0. 5 to 0. 4, accordingly. Due to the reduction of the tunnel face pressure, up to a 280 % larger inward ground movement towards the tunnel was observed. As the shield penetration rate decreased, the torque required for <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> was reduced by 33 %, while the ratio between shield penetration rate and soil extraction was almost constant throughout the tunnel route.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to measure the impact of {{environment}} factors of simulated road tunnels on driver performance. Perceptual cues in the tunnel environment are manipulated in order to evaluate performance measures and examine possible implications for road tunnel safety. The effects of environment factors on driver workload are obtained from 1) objective primary task performance measures (vehicle speed, lateral position, steering wheel reversal rate) and 2) a secondary task performance measure (peripheral detection task). By manipulating visual information it was expected that driver performance could be improved and that our understanding of the demands and needs of <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> can also help us determine which ITS applications may be appropriate in tunnels.

40|$|Purpose: on {{the basis}} of some case {{histories}} the problems are here discussed which can arise where a not exhaustive preliminary risk assessment is available, based on a quite detailed knowledge of the characteristics of the material to be excavated. Such problems cover occupational risks deriving from uncorrected selection of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> technique and fittings layout, and environmental criticalities associated to unfeasible muck management and destination. The target of the present research work developed with reference to the tunneling operations, is to discuss an effective approach to the safety and health protection of the workers at the construction site, and to the environmental quality conditions in the surrounding areas. The latter should be referred to both the environmental protection, and to the reduction to a minimum of the environmental impact, this involving in particular the possibilities of reuse of the materials resulting from the <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> operations. Methods: the research work is a part of a wide range study carried out by the Department of Environment, Land and Infrastructures Engineering (DIATI) of the Politecnico di Torino for the evaluation of the possibilities of the muck reuse. Nevertheless, this approach is possible only in the case of granted absence of hazards due to the presence in the rock mass to be excavated of noxious materials such asbestos, crystalline silica, etc., since, taken into account that in particular in the case of carcinogens, corrective action following exposure or dispersion is not acceptable, the presence of critical pollutants requires both special preventive actions for the workers health, and the impossibility of any reuse of the muck which could introduce risks for the users (e. g. during mechanical processing involving feeding, crushing, milling, sizing and sorting operations, etc.). Results: the first result is a discussion on the possibilities and techniques of a predictive assessment of the asbestos content in the rock, with special reference to the reliability of the achievable results. The second result is a discussion on the technical possibilities available to minimize the occupational risk where critical rock formations must be excavated. Finally, some considerations are provided on the often underestimated problem of the safety fittings availability, which can prove quite dramatic in the aforesaid critical situations. Conclusions: even if for both economic and environmental reasons the management of the material resulting from <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> operations should be carefully evaluated, and any possible reuse considered, the very first step of such an analysis should be a very careful investigation on the possible content of critical minerals in the rocks to be excavated. In the case, no reuse is possible and a selection of the tunneling techniques and technologies suitable to the minimization of the occupational and environmental risks becomes of primary importance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews {{aspects of}} traffic safety and {{behavior}} of drivers in road tunnels based on several case studies of traffic accidents along the traffic zones of tunnel alignment (entrance: zone 2; transition zone: zone 3; and inner zone: zone 4). This paper commences with engineering and design aspects that differentiate between road tunnel and open highways and, afterward, reviews certain issues related to tunnel safety and crashes such as driver behavior, highway alignment, tunnel length, and longitudinal friction. This paper additionally discusses the severity of crashes in road tunnels, specifically severe crashes in road tunnels, including fire incidents and their relationship with vehicle crashes. Finally, additional risk measures and classifications of tunnel safety are introduced. The risk of a crash in a tunnel is reduced compared with crashes on the open road (approximately half); however, tunnel crash severity is higher. The catastrophe potential related to a tunnel fire is higher than in a vehicle crash, even though fire crashes are less frequent than traffic crashes. Drivers in road tunnels generally reduce their speed and increase their lateral position from the right <b>tunnel</b> wall while <b>driving.</b> In shorter <b>tunnels,</b> with reduced <b>driving</b> speed, driver vigilance may be more robust without being hindered by dull driving, which {{is more common in}} longer tunnels. Still, in spite of driver alertness, crash rates in tunnels occur due to the <b>tunnel's</b> unusual <b>driving</b> environment. Crash rates are lower in the tunnel inner zone due to driver alertness, especially after passing the transition zone and acclimating to the tunnel environment. The number of crashes, however, is higher along zone 4 (tunnel inner zone, which is the principal zone), as it covers longer driving distance. According to most studies, short tunnels were found to exhibit higher crash rates than long tunnels because the entrance zones incorporate higher crash rates, compared with the midzones; nonetheless, longer unidirectional (freeway and multilane) tunnels with higher design speed, entail lower driver alertness and diminished concentration due to relatively monotonous driving in spite of a tunnel's closed environment...|$|R

40|$|With {{numerical}} simulation of hydrocyclone separation {{based on the}} Navier-Stokes and mass transfer equations, {{it is possible to}} perform hydrocyclone experiments on a computer. With the help of computational engineering, the cost of conducting hydrocyclone experiments in the planning phase of new hydrocyclone units can be cut drastically. The simulation models also enable a deeper insight into the static and dynamic process behaviour in hydrocyclones. It is shown that the solids stored in the hydrocyclone represents a sensitive process variable for separation in the hydrocyclone. On this basis, a new control concept for a hydrocyclone battery has been developed. As the solids concentration in the feed increases, the combined overflow of all the hydrocyclones in the battery is throttled. At the same time, the feed pump speed is increased. In this way, while the total throughput remains constant, the volume split changes to effect that more solid material is discharged in the hydrocyclone underflow.

We present a general curve of correlation between tunnel sections and specific drilling and specific explosive consumption. We show how pull efficiency cannot be correlated to a single parameter, and how tunnelling by D&B needs to be treated as a complex system. Finally, we propose a method for quantifying and classifying the difficulty of tunnelling. The deviation of specific drilling (SD) from industrial average trend is used as an indicator of difficulty: easier when SD is lower than average, and more difficult when SD is higher than average. We show how such deviation can be preliminarily associated with lithotypes.

30|$|The {{section of}} shield tunnel of the Chengdu Metro line passes {{primarily}} through sandy cobble strata. There are many buildings with spread foundations along the lines. Shield tunnel construction will disturb the ground, causing displacement or stress to adjacent spread foundations. Based on the similarity theory, a laboratory model test of shield <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> {{was carried out}} to study the influence of shield tunnel excavation on the displacement of adjacent spread foundation. The results show that foundation closer to the tunnel has greater displacement or settlement than that further away. The horizontal displacement is small and is influenced greatly by the cutting face. The displacement along the machine driving direction is bigger and is significantly affected by the thrust force. Settlement occurs primarily when shield machine passes close to the foundation and is the greatest at that time. Uneven settlement {{at the bottom of}} the spread foundation reaches a maximum after the excavation ends. In a numerical simulation, a particle flow model was constructed to study the impact of shield tunnel excavation on the stresses in the ground. The model showed stress concentration {{at the bottom of the}} spread foundation. With the increasing ground loss ratio, a loose area appears in the tunnel dome where the contact force dropped. Above the loose area, the contact force increases, forming an arch-shaped soil area which prevents the loose area from expanding to the ground surface. The excavation also changed the pressure distribution around spread foundation.|$|E
40|$|The modern {{approach}} to the design and management of tunnel excavation, and muck reuse, can be influenced {{to a great extent}} by the possible presence of rock formations containing asbestos minerals. This situation creates problems concerning the protection of theworkers' health and the expectable environmental criticalities, while a drastic re-consideration of the muck destination is necessary. Since, in the case of carcinogens, corrective action following exposure or dispersion is not acceptable, detailed knowledge of the haracteristics of the material to be excavated is all the more essential. Only on this basis it is possible to design the unneling operations in a prevention through design approach, so that the <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> techniques, fittings and technologies, and special equipment and modus operandi, can grant, where necessary, minimized risk conditions, and make a correct decision on whether, how and when these measures must be fully activated, since such an approach involves a remarkable impact on costs and work organization.

40|$|The {{underground}} construction operations {{require special}} attention to Occupational Safety and Health - OS&H aspects. In such situations, the presence of some ubiquitous pollutants (e. g. silica) further contributes to the already critical environment due to narrow operating spaces, high concentration of great power machinery, production of airborne particulates from excavation activities. Moreover, the geological variability of rock formations may challenge the design decisions, and affect the exposure of workers to noxious pollutants. In this context an ongoing and continuous monitoring of the workers' exposure conditions and of the working environment quality can provide useful information about the possible correlation between geo-mechanical parameters of the rock formations, erformance parameters of the used technologies and techniques, and production or release of pollutants. The paper summarizes {{the results of a}} study carried out at "La Maddalena" pilot tunnel of the Turin-Lyon railway line. The excavation by an open Tunnel Boring Machine -TBM- takes place in a geological environment of rocks with a content of crystalline silica (quartz) ranging from 30 to 80 %. Hence, ongoing and continuous measurements (personal and stationary) in compliance with the up to date reference standards were scheduled from the very early stages of the excavation, to monitor the content of airborne particulate (respirable fraction) and crystalline silica. The study discusses factors and parameters possibly affecting the content of airborne silica: • the geological aspects; • the state of fracturing of the rock (in terms of Rock Mass Rate - RMR); • the water seepage; • the TBM's Performance parameters (thrust, head rpm, and daily progress rate); • the micro-climatic conditions in the tunnel. Due to the great variability of activities involved by the <b>tunnel</b> <b>driving</b> macro-phases, the evaluations on workers were conducted by homogeneous groups, divided by work area and with specific indication of the different jobs. The results proved that for almost all the groups the crystalline silica levels exceeded 0, 025 mg·m- 3, Threshold Limit Value - Time- Weighted Average - TLV-TWA for the pulmonary fibrosis Risk suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists - ACGIH (coherently with the ACGIH's approach to provide information on the risk involved by substances with reference only to health impairments other than cancer, and to include clear information on the possible carcinogenic class).
