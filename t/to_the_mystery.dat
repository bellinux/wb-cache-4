5|$|After its premiere, Eaten Alive {{was widely}} criticized for false advertising. One critic {{compared}} the special <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mystery</b> of Al Capone's Vaults—a television event {{that ended with}} a similarly disappointing outcome that did not meet promoted expectations.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{position of the}} present Cuban government is still that Mella was killed at Gerardo Machado's orders, but it admits that Tina Modotti was a Stalinist operative who operated {{in a number of}} countries. Yet there are some even in Cuba who seem to believe that Vidali did it. Adding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery,</b> according to Albers (2002), both Magriñat and Diego Rivera, who had just returned from Cuba, had warned Mella that he was in danger.|$|E
25|$|The Scarpetta novels {{include a}} great deal of detail on {{forensic}} science. The initial resolution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> is found in the forensic investigation of the murder victim's corpse, although Scarpetta does considerably more field investigation and confrontation with suspects than real-life medical examiners. The novels generally climax with action scenes in which Scarpetta and her associates confront, or are confronted by, the killer or killers, usually concluding with the death of the killer. The novels are considered to have influenced the development of popular TV series on forensics, both fictional, such as , and documentaries, such as Cold Case Files.|$|E

25|$|The series, {{while still}} {{following}} the basic mystery-solving format of its predecessors, was broadcast as a 52-chapter animated televised novel and included elements similar to live-action mystery/adventure {{shows such as}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Lost. An overarching mystery surrounding the gang's hometown of Crystal Cove, California became the series' main story arc, with pieces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> unfolding episode by episode. Also featured were romantic entanglements and interpersonal conflict between the lead characters. The series ran for 52 episodes over two seasons, with a three-part finale airing across April 4 and 5, 2013 – exactly three years from the debut.|$|E
25|$|In 1824 the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane, {{commissioned}} Hamilton Hume {{and former}} Royal Navy Captain William Hovell to lead {{an expedition to}} find new grazing land {{in the south of}} the colony, and also to find an answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> of where New South Wales' western rivers flowed. Over 16 weeks in 1824–25, Hume and Hovell journeyed to Port Phillip and back. They made many important discoveries including the Murray River (which they named the Hume), many of its tributaries, and good agricultural and grazing lands between Gunning, New South Wales and Corio Bay, Port Phillip.|$|E
25|$|Man from Atlantis was a made-for-TV {{film and}} a {{short-lived}} (1977–1978) series on NBC, created by Mayo Simon and produced by Herbert F. Solow. It starred Patrick Duffy as an amnesiac called Mark Harris, presumably an apparent {{survivor of the}} lost continent of Atlantis, who could breathe underwater and endure the high pressures of the ocean depths. Duffy later wrote a novel based on the series, also titled Man From Atlantis, without known assistance from either Simon or Solow; he intended it to provide his own solutions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery,</b> and {{fill in the gaps}} in the memories, of Mark Harris.|$|E

25|$|The Christ of Paul shares {{similarities}} {{with the}} Greco-Roman mystery cults. Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy explicitly argue that Jesus was a deity, akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> cults, while Dorothy Murdock {{argues that the}} Christ myth draws heavily on the Egyptian story of Osiris and Horus. According to Robert Price, the story of Jesus portrayed in the Gospels is akin to the mythic hero archetype. The mythic hero archetype is present in many cultures who often have miraculous conceptions or virgin births heralded by wise men and marked by a star, are tempted by or fight evil forces, die on a hill, appear after death and then ascend to heaven.|$|E
25|$|Murmurs sound {{characterized}} the quieter, introverted {{side of the}} first wave of alternative rock in the United States. The sound was new at the time, though not stepping beyond the constructs of traditional rock music. The guitars have a bright, ring-like chime that brought on comparisons to The Byrds, and the bass guitar has the bright punchy sound of the Rickenbacker favored by Mike Mills. Mills carries much of the melodic element of the music on the bass, contributing to the moody sound of early R.E.M. albums. Also contributing to this sound is the distant singing of Michael Stipe whose obscure lyrics, sung indistinctly, lend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> and depth of the music.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{an article}} in The Sunday Times claimed that a diary, film and {{photographic}} evidence proving {{the existence of the}} Angels of Mons from a World War I soldier named William Doidge had been found. The article discussed a long involved story in which Doidge was involved with an American GI and an angel seen years later in Woodchester Mansion. It was claimed Marlon Brando and Tony Kaye were going to spend £350,000 to buy the evidence to make a film. Other papers like Variety and the Los Angeles Times and television programmes soon followed up the story and a website connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> became very popular. The footage was supposedly found in a trunk in an antique shop by Danny Sullivan in Monmouth, close to Machen's birthplace of Caerleon. In 2002, in a BBC Radio documentary; The Making of an Urban Myth, Sullivan admitted the story was a complete hoax to drum up interest in Woodchester Mansion; the footage and soldier never existed.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Guardian, Brian Moylan {{compared}} Eaten Alive <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mystery</b> of Al Capone's Vaults—Geraldo Rivera's infamous {{live television}} special that featured the 1986 {{opening of a}} secret vault once owned by Al Capone, which was purported to contain valuable items but ended up only containing debris.

500|$|The {{fantasy of}} She {{received}} particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics.

This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mystery</b> a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E

[...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best!
