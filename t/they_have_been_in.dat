25|$|From a legal standpoint, the Rorschach test {{images have}} been in the public domain for many years in most countries, {{particularly}} those with a copyright term of up to 70 years post mortem auctoris. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law. They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain. This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose. William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book Big Secrets, where he also described the method of administering the test.|$|E
25|$|Other {{similarities}} {{include the}} immunological {{memory of the}} adaptive immune system in vertebrates and the observation that a similar collective memory (operating with a yet-to-be-explained mechanism) occurs in some insect societies e.g. individual Z. angusticollis survive M. anisopliae infections significantly more when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with a previously infected conspecifc, a 'social transfer of immunity' or 'social vaccination'. Transplant rejection caused by non-self major histocompatibility complexes is frequently {{thought to be a}} byproduct with no evolutionary function, however Cremer cites cases (such as the colonial star ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri)) where recognizing foreign cells may have evolved as an adaptation - if so, then this could be analogous to the self-recognition systems in social insects which prevent brood parasitism and the worker policing behaviours which suppress 'social tumours'. Specific immune cells in animals 'patrol' tissues looking for parasites, as do worker-caste individuals in colonies.|$|E
25|$|Several African {{leaders said}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> {{touch with the}} ousted Malian {{president}} {{and that he was}} still safe and under the protection of forces that remained loyal to him at an undisclosed location outside Bamako.|$|R

500|$|According to the U.S. Forest Service, Shoshone National Forest has the {{greatest}} number of [...] glaciers of any National Forest in the Rocky Mountains. The forest recreation guide lists 16 named and 140 unnamed glaciers within the forest, all in the Wind River Range. Forty-four of these glaciers are in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness, centered around the highest mountain peaks. However, the state water board for Wyoming lists only 63 glaciers for the entire Wind River Range, which includes glaciers in adjacent Bridger-Teton National Forest. Researchers claim that for most of the period that glaciers have been known to exist in the forest, that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a state of general retreat, with glacial mass losses of as much as 25percent between the years 1985 and 2009.|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the pioneers}} of tropicália, {{influences}} from genres such as rock and punk have been pervasive in his recordings, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> those of other stars of the period, including Caetano Veloso and Tom Zé. Gil's interest in the blues-based music of rock pioneer Jimi Hendrix, in particular, has been described by Veloso as having [...] "extremely important consequences for Brazilian music". Veloso also noted the influence of Brazilian guitarist and singer Jorge Ben on Gil's musical style, coupled with that of traditional music. After the height of tropicália in the 1960s, Gil became increasingly interested in black culture, particularly in the Jamaican musical genre of reggae. He described the genre as [...] "a form of democratizing, internationalizing, speaking a new language, a Heideggerian form of passing along fundamental messages".|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the game was less well received. Critics panned the music as [...] "easily the worst Castlevania soundtrack" [...] and [...] "muddy, plodding, and {{reminiscent}} of the days of four-channel NES soundtracks". Conversely, GameSpot found that the music was [...] "decent" [...] and occasionally [...] "fitting or even catchy", but {{failed to live up}} to the high expectations of the series. IGN felt that while not [...] "quite as bad as importers have made it out to be", the songs [...] "aren't nearly as nice as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> past Castlevania adventures." [...] Reviewers also disliked the lack of difficulty with GamePro describing it as the game's [...] "biggest flaw". Other criticism included predictable and easy boss battles, and [...] "a much smaller explorable area and somewhat less compelling map design".|$|E
50|$|The Class NG9 {{locomotives}} {{were observed}} dumped at the Sá da Bandeira shops by 1969, without their tenders. At {{the time it}} appeared as if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> that condition for some time. The branchline itself <b>was</b> closed <b>in</b> 1970.|$|R

500|$|After {{starting}} 2009 {{with two}} warm-up shows for their tour of Japan in Scarborough and Crewe, the band {{later on in}} May announced that Feeder had [...] "ended their partnership" [...] with drummer Mark Richardson, who returned to his original band Skunk Anansie. [...] Mark was replaced by session drummer Karl Brazil who had just come off tour with James Blunt, and had also played drums for British band Ben's Brother. Karl's first live appearances with the band, {{after a series of}} university events were at the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival, stating that this would be their only UK festival appearance of 2009, as they would be working on their seventh studio album. It was then later announced that they would be appearing at the Hevy Music Festival in Folkestone. Here they previewed a new track titled [...] "Sentimental", with the announcement that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a recording studio in South Wales.|$|E
500|$|... "Til It Happens to You" [...] is {{a somber}} tune {{featuring}} orchestral production and soaring strings. The pop ballad delivers an empowering message: [...] "Hold {{your head up}} and be strong / When you fall you gotta get up", and {{has been described as}} [...] "stirring and emotional". Featuring a classical production, the song emphasizes Gaga's vocals, keeping focus on the lyrics, which clarifies that one cannot understand the feelings of a victim unless <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> similar situation. The first verse is sung by Gaga in a vulnerable voice, which gradually changes into an aggressive tone, and finally a joyous one during the final lyrics. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] is set in the time signature common for a slow tempo of 59 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals spanning from E3 to D5. The song follows a basic sequence of Am–C–Fmaj7–C–G/B as its chord progression.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews for {{the album}} were {{generally}} positive with Kerrang! describing it as [...] "stupendous stuff and concrete proof that Maiden are as electrifying and important as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a long time." [...] Sputnikmusic were also {{positive about the}} album, giving special mention to [...] "Paschendale", described as [...] "quite easily the ultimate Maiden masterpiece." [...] Although deeming the first three songs [...] "refreshing yet unremarkable", AllMusic describes Dance of Death as [...] "a triumphant return to form for these heavy metal legends." ...|$|E
