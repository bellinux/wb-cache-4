Based on the reverse-cycle methods, the combined defrost technology makes full use of the compressor air-supplying enthalpy-adding, air-cooled heat exchanger inside the vehicle preheating, temperature-raising, enthalpy-adding and the external heat exchanger condensation temperature-increasing technologies. The fast defrosting process can be realized by means of releasing the condensation heat and volume significantly while the outer heat exchanger is conducting a defrosting operation.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2017. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Francis Kulacki. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 144 pages. Frost formation and anti-icing methods are studied {{in a variety}} of areas for decades. In refrigeration systems, a number of studies are focused on the influence of surface treatment on delaying the time of frost formation. There are far fewer studies on the effect of surface wettability on the defrost process. Some of the literature show experimental results on <b>defrost</b> <b>time</b> for different surfaces, but the results could be different based on individual experimental conditions. In this study, the influences of surface wettability on the defrost process are investigated analytically. The melting process is divided into three stages based on the behaviors of the meltwater. The water saturation and meltwater draining velocity are formulated for absorption and drainage stages separately. The comparison among the melting rate, the permeation rate, and the draining velocity determines the meltwater behavior, which influences the defrost process and defrost mechanisms. The slumping condition is a special phenomenon in the melting process and can be a potential method for frost removal. Water accumulation at the surface decreases the adherence strength of the frost column to the surface. A slumping criterion is formulated based on the analysis of interfacial forces and the body force on the frost column. The slumping condition of the model depends on the contact angle on hydrophilic surfaces and on the contact angle hysteresis on hydrophobic surfaces. Experiments of frost and defrost process on vertical surfaces with different wetting conditions are conducted on a lab-build setup. The experimental results show that <b>defrost</b> <b>time</b> and efficiency are determined by the system design, the heating methods, the heat flux applied at the surface and the surface wettability. Defrost mechanisms vary with surface wettability. During the defrost process, a frost column detaches from a superhydrophobic surface and falls off as a whole piece. While on the superhydrophilic and plain surfaces, frost melts, and water film or retention evaporates. <b>Defrost</b> <b>time</b> and efficiency are not significantly different on the tested surfaces at the point that frost melts and water film/retention droplets remain on the surfaces. However, <b>defrost</b> <b>time</b> and efficiency are improved noticeably on the superhyrophobic surface for a complete defrost process in which the water evaporation time is included. This research serves as a supplement to current studies on the effect of surface wettability in refrigeration systems. In application, the preference to the different surface wettability depends on the practical operation requirements and the actual system design...|$|R
40|$|Frost {{formation}} on {{the cold}} evaporator surface is a typical problem in household refrigerators. It happens due to humidity present in the ambient air associated with frequent door openings. In addition, mass transfer from stored goods to dry internal cabinet air and moisture infiltration through door gaskets also contribute to frost formation on the evaporator surface. To prevent this, the evaporator has to be defrosted manually or automatically (as in modern refrigerators). To do so, an electrical heater is switched on at a preset time and frequency and defrosts the evaporator. During this <b>time,</b> <b>defrosted</b> water is drained through a pipe into a water tray which is usually placed at {{the vicinity of the}} compressor. There the water evaporates mainly due to heat transfer from hot compressor shell. This system of defrosting and evaporation works well in areas with low relative humidity, where the amount of defrosted water is small and the evaporation rate is higher when compared to places with high relative humidity. Moreover, the compressor shell temperatures of high efficient compressors are not usually high enough to provide the minimum evaporation rate to balance the defrosted water flow rate and thus avoid water overflow. The aim of this work is to get {{a better understanding of the}} defrosted water evaporation process and to come up with low cost, practical and more efficient designs of water trays. To this end a test facility was designed and constructed to reproduce the compressor operating conditions and the defrosted water flow rate and temperature. The test rig was placed within a climate-controlled room with a strict control of air temperature and relative humidity. A mathematical model was also developed to predict the water evaporation rate based on the fundamental conservation equations of mass and energy.

Firstly, a description of both an experimental prototype ASHP unit where the novel reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method may be realized, and its operating modes are presented. This is followed by reporting an experimental set up for testing the defrosting performance of the prototype ASHP unit using the novel thermal energy storage (TES) based reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method.

The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the <b>defrosting</b> <b>time</b> by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the compressor's suction pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method. In addition, when the TES based reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method was used, the mean indoor coil surface temperature during defrosting was about 25 K higher than that when the traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method was used. These results suggested that as compared to the use of the traditional standard reverse-cycle hot gas defrosting method, the use of the novel TES based defrosting method would enable a quicker space heating resumption, impacting less on indoor thermal environment due to defrosting.

The aim of this review is to collect information about the stability of cytotoxic and hazardous drugs after this treatment. Methods: The scientific literature about drug stability studies was reviewed. The data describe {{the name of the}} drug, the manufacturer, the final concentration, the temperature and time of freezing storage, type of microwave oven, the thawing power, the measurement, the method and the results after treatment and final long-term storage at 5 ± 3 °C. Results: From 1980 to 2011, nine drugs (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, daunorubicine, doxorubicine, epirubicine, fluorouracile, ganciclovir, methotrexate sodium, mitomycine C) were studied after MFTT and the results were presented in 10 publications. The storage freezing temperature ranged from - 15 °C to - 30 °C, the time storage from 14 to 364 days, the thaw from moderate to full power. High performance liquid chromatography is mainly used to measure drug concentrations. All drugs are stable during and after the treatment. However, mitomycine needs to be stored at - 30 °C. The long-term stability after MFTT was evaluated only for the ganciclovir after 7 days, and for fluorouracile after 28 days. The concentration of the seven drugs was measured after one to 11 freezing-thawing cycles with a loss below 5 %.

Frozen products become popular among consumers for home use due to the minimal cooking time. Consumer evaluation is the most relevant and significant for identifying preferences and evaluating quality products in Russian markets. In this regard, a qualitative analysis of marketing research has been carried out and preferences have been identified according to which criteria consumers buy quick-frozen products. Some methods of sensory analysis have been used (consumer evaluation, the profile method, and pairwise comparison method). The dominant factor in choosing a brand of quick-frozen products is the combination of an acceptable price and quality, and to a lesser extent, the recommendation of acquaintances, the type of packaging and advertising of products. The research is aimed at identifying organoleptic properties that affect the consumer evaluation of the quality of frozen, thawed grapes in comparison with the reference product. Fruits and berries freeze for hours and even minutes, but are stored for a long time. The problem arises in rehydration – the return of the product to its original state, close to fresh natural raw material. The main goal of the research is aimed at identifying some rational method of defrosting, corresponding to organoleptic and consumer properties.

40|$|Abstract: Air/water {{heat pumps}} for heating systems are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. A major challenge for these systems is the formation of ice and frost in the fin-tube evaporator. Defrosting is usually accomplished by the reverse-cycle or hot-gas defrosting technique. In both defrosting modes, the compressor is in operation. An alternative method is ambient-air defrosting, where the heat pump’s compressor is simply turned off and defrosting is achieved by exposure to ambient air, which is conveyed through the fin tube evaporator by the fan. A model has been developed which permits the calculation of the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the melting of ice and frost deposits. The theoretical results have been validated by numerous defrosting experiments. The theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that both temperature and humidity of the ambient air strongly influence the total heat flow and the <b>time</b> needed for <b>defrosting.</b> Already at an ambient air temperature of 2 °C and a dew point temperature of 0 °C, the heat flow of ambient-air defrosting is {{comparable to that of}} hot-gas defrosting; energy consumption is decreased by a factor of 8 – 10, however. On the other hand, ambient-air defrosting is less effective at air conditions below the extended fog-isotherm at 0 °C.

The most common defrosting technique is to reverse the cycle. Unfortunately it provokes {{a break in the}} heat production and the defrosting energy is drawn from the heat stock previously constituted. This article presents the design of a heat pump prototype for simultaneous heating and cooling (named HPS). Its refrigeration circuit involves a piece of refrigeration circuit that could be modified and implemented to standard air-source heat pumps during retrofit or maintenance in order to carry out defrosting with better performance. It uses a water tank that recovers the subcooling energy of the refrigerant at first and is subsequently used as a cold source for evaporation. The second part of the sequence liberates the air evaporator for defrosting. Between two evaporators (air-to-refrigerant and water-to-refrigerant) at different temperatures, a thermosiphon forms. A supplementary amount of vapour flows out of the water evaporator and migrates towards the colder inside surface of the air evaporator tubes in thermal contact with the frost layer. The vapour, while condensing, brings the defrosting energy. The liquid returns back to the water evaporator by gravity. This defrosting system was observed by means of infrared thermography and tested experimentally on a heat pump prototype. It proved very efficient as <b>defrosting</b> <b>time</b> was short. Using this defrosting technique ensures: - a continuous heat production with even better performance while defrosting thanks to the higher evaporating temperature, - more frequent defrosting sequences because more easily activated, impacting on lower frost thickness and higher mean heat transfer coefficients.

40|$|International audienceStarting from a {{critical}} analysis of a first "proof of concept" study on {{the utility of the}} liver volatolome for detecting livestock exposure to environmental micropollutants (Berge et al., 2011), the primary aim {{of this paper is to}} improve extraction conditions so as to obtain more representative extracts by using an extraction temperature closer to livestock physiological conditions while minimizing analytical variability and maximizing Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) abundancies. Levers related to extraction conditions and sample preparation were assessed in the light of both abundance and coefficient of variation of 22 candidate VOC markers identified in earlier volatolomic studies. Starting with a CAR/PDMS fiber and a 30 min extraction, the reduction of SPME temperature to 40 °C resulted in a significant decrease in the area of 14 candidate VOC markers (p< 0. 05), mainly carbonyls and alcohols but also a reduction in the coefficient of variation for 17 of them. In order to restore VOC abundances and to minimize variability, two approaches dealing with sample preparation were investigated. By increasing sample <b>defrosting</b> <b>time</b> at 4 °C from 0 to 24 h yielded higher abundances and lower variabilities for 15 and 13 compounds, respectively. Lastly, by using additives favouring the release of VOCs (1. 2 g of NaCl) the sensitivity of the analysis was improved with a significant increase in VOC abundances of more than 50 % for 13 out of the 22 candidate markers. The modified SPME parameters significantly enhanced the abundances while decreasing the analytical variability for most candidate VOC markers. The second step was to validate the ability of the revised SPME protocol to discriminate intentionally contaminated broiler chickens from controls, under case/control animal testing conditions. After verification of the contamination levels of the animals by national reference laboratories, data analysis by a multivariate chemometric method (Common Components and Specific Weights Analysis - ComDim) showed that the liver volatolome could reveal dietary exposure of broilers to a group of environmental pollutants (PCBs), a veterinary treatment (monensin), and a pesticide (deltamethrin), thus confirming the usefulness of this analytical set-up...|$|R

Beattie The thesis presents the experimental results of an air-to-air heat/energy exchanger (HEE), tested with four different cores, to assess the performance under Arctic climate conditions. Four per-formance indicators are presented: (i) the outlet supply air temperature; (ii) the exhaust air flow rate; (iii) the sensible and latent heat transfer effectiveness; and (iv) UV-value. The mass of ice formed within the core was also measured {{at the end of}} each experiment. The experiments are separated into three phases: Phase 1 with one HEE without recirculation defrost, Phase 2 with one HEE with recirculation defrost, and Phase 3 with two HEEs in parallel with alternating recir-culation defrost. Correlation−based models were developed that predict the change in heat transfer effectiveness in terms of the change in exhaust air mass flow rate, inlet supply air temperature and core type. The experiments with recirculation defrost proved that the factory-set <b>defrost</b> <b>times</b> are a conservative approach that manages the formation of frost. Because of the reduced operating time as controlled by the timer, all cores have almost the same sensible heat transfer effectiveness. The use of vapour-permeable cores reduced the rate of frost growth and the amount of frost at inlet supply air temperatures where core frosting was a concern. The rate of core frosting was dependant on the inlet supply air temperature. Frost formation impeded the transfer of heat between the two airstreams and reduced the adjusted sensible and latent heat transfer effectiveness for all cores. Recirculation defrost effectively managed the formation of frost in all tested exchanger cores for the duration of the tests at inlet supply air temperature down to − 35 °C. However, the use of recirculation defrost intermittently interrupts the supply of outdoor air resulting in reduced ventilation rates.

An important {{problem in the}} refrigeration industry is the formation and removal of frost layers on sub-freezing air coolers. The frost layer, a porous structure of ice and air, directly diminishes the performance and efficiency of the entire cooling system by presenting resistances to air flow and heat transfer in the air cooler. To return the system to pre-frosted performance the layer must be removed through a defrost cycle. The most common defrost cycle uses heat applied at the heat exchanger surfaces to melt the frost. Current methods of defrosting are inherently inefficient, {{with the majority of}} the heat being lost to the surrounding environment. Most studies have concentrated on the formation of the frost layer, and not the melting phenomena during the defrost cycle. In this study, direct measurements and a fundamental model to describe the melting process of a frost layer on a vertical heated surface are presented. The experimental facility provides the first direct measurements of heat and mass transfer during defrost. The measurements confirmed the multistage nature of defrost. The multistage model characterized the different thermal and mass transport processes that dominate each stage. The first stage is dominated by sensible heating of the frost layer. Both the experiment and model showed that heat and mass transfer through sublimation during the initial stages are insignificant, accounting for less than 1 % of the total energy transfer. The second stage of defrost is dominated by the melting of the frost layer. The melt rate model generally predicts the front velocity within 25 % of the velocity determined using the digital image analysis technique. Higher heat transfer rates resulted in faster melt velocity, and thus shortened <b>defrost</b> <b>times.</b> Evaporation of the melt liquid from the surface dominates the final stage. The heat transfer model for this stage predicts the heat transfer coefficient within ± 25 % of the experiment. The overall defrost efficiency was found to be primarily dependent on the initial frost thickness, with thicker layer having less heat lost to the ambient space and a higher efficiency...|$|R
