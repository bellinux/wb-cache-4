Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. <b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} who see <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created {{to establish the}} Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction.

In Mark 6:1-4, the author of <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy.

5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} of a type of gospel harmony that used <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew as a base text but did not include <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. <b>The</b> <b>gospel</b> has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers.

Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. <b>The</b> <b>gospel</b> also contained sayings of Jesus.

5|$|The early Church Fathers {{believed}} {{there was only one}} Jewish–Christian gospel, perhaps in different versions; however, scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three. Jerome's references to a Gospel of the Hebrews, or variants of that name, are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations. Hegesippus, Eusebius, and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel, which Jerome referred to as <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes. Gospel of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar to <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew. A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis, which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites. Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Ebionites. The existence of three independent Jewish–Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus. However, that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of the Hebrews and the other Jewish–Christian gospels, as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel, is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.|$|E
