40|$|AbstractDespite the {{significant}} progress made towards {{the understanding of}} flame propagation mechanisms in dust-air mixtures, dust explosions still have a frequent occurrence and their danger presents a continuous threat to industries that produce, use and treat solid powders and dusts of combustible materials. In fact, many physical aspects are still needed to be clarified given the major difference existing between flame propagating in gaseous mixtures and in suspensions and many questions are still unanswered regarding the reasons behind the violence of fine metal dust explosions. Few experimental observations and theoretical considerations emphasized the potential role <b>of</b> radiation heat <b>transfer</b> in the behaviour of dust clouds’ flames in which acceleration in flame propagation speed and instabilities were observed. Unfortunately, only few information is available, so far, concerning the capacity <b>of</b> radiative <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> part in the propagation process. While investigating radiation phenomenon in dust clouds, {{we are faced with}} a complicated problem difficult to model analytically. The development of numerical approach, based on discrete element method (DEM), in order to treat this problem, seems more convenient. MULTICOR code, developed at the LTI, has already succeeded at modelling heat transfer in a bed of particles. Under this work, radiative heat transfer exchanged between particles in suspension is successfully calculated and we propose an original method <b>of</b> calculating heat <b>transfers</b> between dust and gas in the preheat zone of the flame. We are currently working on adapting the radiation models implemented to the case of fine particles and taking into consideration light scattered. With the purpose of determining the flame propagation speed and improving the knowledge of the phenomena involved, {{it would be possible to}} contribute to the development of suitable means of prevention and mitigation of dust explosion hazard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Turbulences in the Earths {{atmosphere}} lead to {{the loss}} in spatial resolution power of ground based telescopes. The common mechanism used {{to deal with this}} phenomenon is Adaptive Optics (AO), which compensates for the loss in resolution power, in real time, by means of a servo-control loop. In this paper, we propose a new approach to phase reconstruction of astronomical images using Microcanonical Multiscale Formalism (herein referred to as MMF) and also check the performance of the reconstruction under noise. In fact, turbulent flows, although chaotic in nature, possess a complex arrangement of geometrical structures related to the cascading properties of physical variables; the properties of these variables reflect the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>taking</b> place from large scales to smaller ones. The geometrical representation of the cascade process can be exploited by the use of an appropriate wavelet (here Battle-Lemarié of order 3) decomposition which leads to a proper reconstruction of the turbulent phase.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide further insight into the {{relationship}} between supervisor support and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training, by <b>taking</b> into account the effects of other transfer‐influencing factors in a systemic approach <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> process. Design/methodology/approach – A review of studies on factors affecting <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training was conducted, with a specific focus on the effects of supervisor support, resulting in the development of a research model <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> process. All components of the model were measured by means of questionnaires for former trainees and their supervisors, and stepwise regression analyses were carried out to examine the relationships in the model. Findings – Results indicate indirect relationships between supervisor support and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training, by means of both trainees' motivation to transfer and the transfer climate. The indirect effect of supervisor support on <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training is only slight, however. Learning results are shown to be the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training. Research limitations/implications – Owing to the small sample size structural equation modelling techniques could not be used, thus limiting the possibility to test the model as a single entity. The use of perceptional measures implies the risk of response tendencies from trainees and supervisors. Further research using different measures and different timing of measurement during the training and transfer process is recommended. Practical implications – Results of this study indicate that supervisor support that is intended to enhance <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training can best be directed at improvement <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> climate at the workplace. Originality/value – The paper provides both researchers and practitioners with a further insight into the complex effects of supervisor support on <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> training, indicating the importance <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> into account the effects of other transfer‐influencing factors...|$|R

Garibashvili thus occupied the most powerful political office in the country as the constitution amendments had transferred power from the president {{to the prime minister}} and the government. At heated parliamentary debates with the United National Movement minority during the vote, Garibashvili promised economic improvement and stressed that Georgia's EU and NATO aspiration would remain his foreign priorities. On November 24, 2013, he was elected chairman of the Georgian Dream-Democratic Georgia party, succeeding Ivanishvili. Garibashvili announced his resignation on December 23, 2015. While no reason was given for the sudden move, it was reported that he may have done so due to low levels of support for the Georgian Dream among the populace, with it polling at 18% in November, and parliamentary elections scheduled for 2016. Opposition politicians, analysts and media speculated that falling support for the ruling Georgian Dream coalition, pressure from the previous prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, or tensions with the president Giorgi Margvelashvili were possible explanations for Garibashvili's resignation.
