50|$|In 2007, 22 states, {{including}} New York, California, Ohio and Virginia {{have included}} an entry on their state individual {{income tax return}} for taxpayers to voluntarily calculate an amount for use tax liability. Taxpayers, however, {{have been reluctant to}} pay taxes to the state. A few of these states have tried another approach by pre-determining the tax liability owed by every taxpayer by a <b>tax</b> <b>table</b> based on the individual’s adjusted gross income. For example, a Michigan taxpayer with $45,000 of income can use the state’s use <b>tax</b> <b>table</b> to estimate his use tax liability as $36. Use of this table is limited, however, to purchases of less than $1,000 and may be challenged during an audit. For purchases over $1,000, the taxpayer must calculate the tax for each item and add this amount to the use tax from the table. States using this method have seen an increase in voluntary compliance over those states that have the taxpayers calculate the use tax themselves.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} pages in the federal tax law grew from 400 in 1913 to over 72,000 in 2011. The {{increase}} in complexity {{can be attributed to}} {{an increase in the number}} and range of activities being taxed, an increase in the number of exemptions, credits, and deductions available, an increase in the subtlety of the rules governing taxation and the edge cases explicitly spelled out based on historical experience, and an increase in the base of taxpayers making it necessary to offer longer, more explicit instructions for less sophisticated taxpayers. As an example, whereas the initial versions of Form 1040 came only with a rate schedule included in the tax form itself, the IRS now publishes a complete <b>tax</b> <b>table</b> for taxable income up to $100,000 so that people can directly look up their tax liability from their taxable income without having to do complicated arithmetic calculations based on the rate schedule. The IRS still publishes its rate schedule so that people can quickly compute their approximate tax liability, and lets people with incomes of over $100,000 compute their taxes directly using the Tax Computation Worksheet.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{changes in}} the United States as a {{consequence}} of the Economic Recovery Act of 1981 (ERITA), the Tax Equality and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA). The effects of ERITA, TEFRA, and TRA are demonstrated via measures of pre-tax and post-tax inequality based on gross household income and disposable household income. Thus, the distribution of income, and also the tax payments, consist of components that are attributed to tax changes and components that are driven by the pre-tax income. Typically, most analysts view the distribution of pre-tax and post-tax income based on GINI coefficients. However, this analysis employs the decomposable Generalized Entropy measure, which enables the distribution of the "between group" and "within group" (weighted average) effects of taxation. Moreover, this approach allows for a more accurate assessment of tax progressivity in the long run. This process provides a better framework to evaluate the policy implications of future tax changes. The results illustrate that long-run income tax progressivity has been declining over time. Concurrently, we witness a relative rise in pre-tax and post-tax income inequality over the latter portion of the accounting interval. It is further evidenced that a number of exemptions and the type of <b>tax</b> <b>table</b> used create more equalization within each group, but cross- group equalization is minimal. When decomposed by quintile, the data reveal more cross-group equalization than within-group equalization. ...|$|E

Taxes on those items were then eliminated on July 1, 2003. To replace revenue lost through Stelly, individual income tax brackets were adjusted upward.

50|$|After {{years of}} {{criticism}} from those who faced higher taxes {{as a result of}} the Stelly Plan, the Louisiana State Legislature in 2008 repealed Stelly. The highest income brackets were returned to the level they were prior to 2003. The tax reduction began in 2009, but the state revenue department did not alter the withholding on individual income <b>tax</b> <b>tables</b> until July 1 of that year. Hence individuals did not receive more disposable income in their paychecks until after July 1 unless they had individually requested that their employers adjust their tax schedules prior to July. The repeal of Stelly could cost the state treasury some $358 million in taxes for the 2009-2010 fiscal year and somewhat less for each year thereafter.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how <b>tax</b> distribution <b>tables</b> often can provide misleading results {{about the impact}} of pending <b>tax</b> legislation. These <b>tables</b> rely excessively on comparisons of average tax liabilities of various income groups, and are typically used to oppose broad income tax relief and foster class warfare notions in tax policy. However, <b>tax</b> distribution <b>tables</b> typically are defective in several ways that once recognized undermine their statistical validity and raise serious questions about their value to policymakers and the public. This study analyzes tax data to examine whether the use of averages in the typical distribution table is statistically sound. These <b>tables</b> usually rank <b>tax</b> filers from lowest to highest incomes, and subdivide them into income groups, such as fifths (quintiles). Then the average tax liabilities of each fifth can be calculated, as can average projected benefits from pending tax relief legislation. Finally, the average tax benefits provided to the various groups can be compared and contrasted. The underlying assumption is that these averages are representative of each income group. However, this Joint Economic Committee analysis of Internal Revenue Service data for individual income tax returns finds that the use of averages does not accurately reflect the tax payments or potential tax changes of most taxpayers in each income group. In fact, most taxpayers in each income group have tax liabilities considerably different from the group averages. This fact is not surprising given the different characteristics of tax filers at similar income levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine whether}} the changes made to the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962 between 1996 and 2012, in respect of fringe benefits, allowances, deductions, <b>tax</b> <b>tables</b> and rebates, where these changes apply to individuals, have resulted in relieving the tax burden placed on individuals in South Africa. The research was conducted by means of a critical analysis of documentary data with specific reference to the Income Tax Act, annual amendments to the Income Tax Act, statistics relating to tax collections, the National Budget and the Annual Budget Speeches as tabled by the Minister of Finance. These sources were utilised to analyse the amendments to the Act that have taken place over the last sixteen years, where they impact on the tax liability of an individual. A hypothetical example incorporating all the variables identified in the analysis of the tax amendments was used to provide a detailed analysis of the tax payable by an individual on an inflation-adjusted year-on-year basis. The research found that, whilst personal income tax is still the largest contributor to the national budget of South Africa, its contribution has decreased from 40. 2 percent in 1996 to 34. 3 percent in 2010. This decrease is partly attributable to the extensive tax reforms undertaken by Government with respect to the <b>tax</b> <b>tables,</b> resulting in a reduction in the marginal tax rates and increased tax rebates which had the effect that the individual taxpayer (as illustrated in the hypothetical example) experienced a decrease in the average rate of tax. In contrast to this, the increase in the taxable income of the hypothetical taxpayer exceeded the average rate of inflation over the period. Furthermore, the actual revenue collected by the government from personal income tax has increased by approximately eleven percent per annum, which far exceeds the average inflation rate of 6. 23 percent. The research indicated that this could be the result of the increase in the taxable value of fringe benefits, specifically medical aid contributions and company cars, as well as the inclusion of the full amount of allowances in taxable income and the limits placed on the deductions an individual may claim. The result is a broadening of the tax base of the individual taxpayer. Therefore, although the government may have achieved its goal of a fairer tax system, the amendments made to fringe benefits, allowances and deductions have resulted in an increase in the average taxable income of individuals. ...|$|R

The different capital taxes were discussed individually. Standard norms and criteria used to evaluate taxes have been identified.

Capital as an asset is defined as all assets that are not intended for immediate use. Arguments in favour of capital tax centre around moral issues like equality. It may be argued in favour of capital tax that the implicit income of capital should be taxed in order to maintain economic neutrality of the tax system.
