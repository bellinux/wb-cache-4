5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun {{in the opposite direction}} to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke bellowed out of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E

25|$|The X300, {{introduced}} in 1994, was stylistically intended {{to evoke the}} image of the more curvaceous Series XJ. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was redesigned significantly to return to four individual round headlamps that provided definition to the sculptured hood. Mechanically, it was similar to the XJ40 that it replaced.|$|E
25|$|The American {{models were}} facelifted for the 1966 model year with more squared-off {{front and rear}} styling. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was {{extended}} three inches (76mm), that increase allowed the optional air conditioning to be installed with the new 199, and 232 in-line six-cylinder engines, which were longer than the previous 195.6 versions.|$|E
25|$|One {{innovation}} was {{the attention}} paid to passive safety. The car featured a robust chassis providing above average side impact protection, an unusually short steering column with the steering gear set well back from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and a fuel tank placed in a carefully protected location above the rear axle {{in order to minimize}} fire risk {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|E

25|$|Components of the {{bodywork}} {{were replaced}} with slightly revised carbon fibre and kevlar panels. The under tray {{was replaced with}} a flat version for better stability at high speeds. A second seat and leather upholstery were installed in the cramped cockpit, {{as well as a}} video screen for DVD playback in later years. A small compartment was added to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to carry luggage. A hydraulic suspension system was also added to meet German ride height requirements for street cars.|$|E
25|$|Each car is {{required}} to display its number on each door {{of the car and}} on its roof. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car {{is required}} to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These contingency decals represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs. The series sponsor's logo is displayed on top of the windshield, called the windshield header or windshield banner.|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} left {{the works in}} January 1897, fitted with a Panhard engine, {{followed}} in March by Daimler-engined cars. The first Coventry Daimler-engined product made its maiden run in March 1897. By mid-year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing Léon Bollée cars under licence. Lawson claimed to have made 20 cars by July 1897 making the Daimler Britain's first motor car to go into serial production, an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed, but in their case their production models, at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1896. The Daimlers had a twin-cylinder, 1526cc engine, mounted at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> four-speed gearbox and chain drive to the rear wheels.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the main}} options {{included}} the sunroof $2390, satellite navigation $3800, rear-seat DVD players $3900, Xenon headlights $1800, tyre pressure monitoring system $1395. Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature {{is also on the}} current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Penske {{picked up}} the team cars and {{equipment}} from the El Segundo offices and shipped everything back to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found that Ron Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but {{he felt that the}} front suspension could still be further developed. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske’s team lowered <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and replaced the rubber bushings in the radius rods with heim joints. New roll bars were also developed. After several months of development, Donohue felt that the team now had car that drove like it was on rails.|$|E
25|$|To replace Allmendinger, RPM signed Aric Almirola, who had {{replaced}} Kasey Kahne in the 9 {{car at the}} end of the 2010 season. Almirola earned a Pole start at Charlotte in May, and collected one top 5 and 4 top 10's en route to a 20th-place finish in points. Aric's best run of the year may have been at Kansas in October, where he qualified fifth and lead 69 laps after taking the top spot on lap 6. But on lap 121, Almirola blew a tire, sending his Farmland Ford into the wall. He spun on lap 172 racing for the lead and lost a lap on pit road. After getting his lap back and working his way up to 13th, Almirola hit the wall once again, setting <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> ablaze and ending the promising run.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Renault {{launched}} the saloon {{version of the}} Clio II, named Clio Symbol in Turkey and Eastern Europe, Thalia in Central Europe, Clio Classic in Asia and North Africa, Clio Sedan in Brazil and Paraguay, or Symbol {{in the rest of}} South America (except Argentina where it was called Clio). The car was intended for sale in developing countries, where saloons were traditionally preferred over hatchbacks, most notably in Eastern Europe, where the Thalia was cheaper than the Clio, but was still about 30% more expensive than the Dacia Logan, also sold by Renault as a low cost model. In some Latin American markets the sedan was offered as the Nissan Platina (manufactured in Aguascalientes, Mexico), with slight changes in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to make it resemble the Nissan Altima.
