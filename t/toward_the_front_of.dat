25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the wave {{to become stable}} and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase {{the length of the}} ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E

It is displayed on the side of helicopters and in the standard four wing positions on aircraft. It was used by the Royal Hungarian Air Force until 1942, and then reinstated after the Second World War. The new Gripen fighters will wear a NATO standard compliant grey-on-grey (low-visibility) version of the Hungarian triangle insignia.|$|E
500|$|At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized {{into the}} night {{cruising}} formation. Oldenburg was now the fifth ship, stationed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the 24-ship line. At around 01:10, the German line encountered the six destroyers of the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. Oldenburg fired on several of the destroyers at close range, including [...] and [...] Fortune scored a single hit on Oldenburg with her 4-inch guns. The shell struck a forward searchlight above the bridge and caused serious casualties. The officer responsible for directing the 8.8cm guns was killed, along with three other officers on the bridge. The helmsman was incapacitated and the ship's commander, Captain Höpfner, was wounded. Oldenburg was briefly steaming unsteered, and {{was in danger of}} ramming Posen and Helgoland until Captain Höpfner managed to reach the wheel and take control of the ship. Oldenburg and several other battleships then took [...] under fire; the destroyer was reduced to a flaming wreck. In the darkness, Fortune and Ardent were sunk and the remaining four ships were scattered.|$|E
500|$|By 20:15, the German battle {{line had}} faced the entire {{deployed}} Grand Fleet a second time. Scheer ordered a 180-degree turn at 20:17, which {{was covered by}} a charge by the battlecruiser squadron and a torpedo-boat attack. In order to hasten the maneuver, Schmidt ordered Ostfriesland to turn immediately without waiting for Thüringen behind him. This move caused some difficulty for the IIISquadron ships ahead, though the ships quickly returned to their stations. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Ostfriesland was the eighth ship, stationed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the 24-ship line. An hour later, the leading units of the German line encountered British light forces and a violent firefight at close range ensued. Sometime around 01:10, the armored cruiser [...] stumbled into the German line. Thüringen illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30.5cm rounds into the ship. Ostfriesland fired with her 15cm guns and Kaiser fired both 30.5cm and 15cm guns. In the span of less than a minute, two massive explosions tore the cruiser apart and killed the entire 857-man crew.|$|E

The second caution {{of the race}} {{occurred}} on lap 80, when Junqueira and Tora Takagi collided; Tagaki spun off the track, but was able to continue. Andretti and Franchitti made pit stops during the caution, and the green flag came out on lap 85. Kanaan passed Carpentier on lap 95, and Zanardi went into second shortly afterward, as Carpentier tried conserving fuel to complete the race with one fewer pit stop than the other contenders. Kanaan, Zanardi, and Bräck made pit stops from laps 105 to 113, and Andretti inherited the lead. Franchitti suffered a [...] "mechanical problem" [...] on lap 116, becoming the first driver to retire from the race. More pit stops occurred from laps 121 to 123, and Zanardi claimed the lead over Kanaan. The two contested the lead, and Kanaan was two-tenths of a second behind Zanardi when he made a pit stop for the final time on lap 141. Bräck moved up to second, and was followed by Carpentier and Tagliani.|$|E
500|$|At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized {{into the}} night-cruising formation.

Sometime around 01:10, the armored cruiser [...] stumbled into the German line. Thüringen illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30.5cm rounds into the ship at point-blank range. The first salvo struck near Black Princes rear gun turret, which {{appears to have been}} blown overboard. Thüringen fired a total of ten 30.5cm, twenty-seven 15cm, and twenty-four 8.8cm shells. She was joined by three other battleships, and Black Prince was soon destroyed by a huge ammunition explosion. Around a half an hour later, Thüringen spotted {{what appeared to be a}} Birkenhead-class cruiser. She fired a starshell to illuminate the British cruiser and opened fire with her secondary guns.

500|$|Collectively, the/a crest. Long crest {{feathers}} {{are sometimes}} called quill feathers. Also defined herewith: recumbent crests and recursive crests. A type of [...] feather {{with a long}} [...] with [...] on either side, that often presents as a prominent tuft on the [...] and (or through) the neck and upper [...] Birds with crests include Victoria crowned pigeons, northern lapwings, macaroni penguins and others, but the most recognizable are cockatoos and cockatiels, which can raise or lower their crests at will {{and use them to}} communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defence to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised. In some species the position of the crest is a threat signal {{that can be used to}} predict behaviour. In Steller's jays, for example, a raised crest indicates a likelihood of attack, and a lowered crest indicates a likelihood of retreat. Crests can be recumbent or recursive, depending on the species. The recumbent crest, such as in white cockatoos, has feathers that are straight and lie down essentially flat on the head until fanned out. The recursive crest, such as in sulphur-crested cockatoos and Major Mitchell's cockatoos, is noticeable even when its feathers are not fanned out because they curve upward at the tips even when lying flat, and when standing up, often bend slightly forward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the head. Some birds, like galahs and rose-breasted cockatoos, have modified crests that have both recumbent and recursive features.|$|E

500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so that you could get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{turbulent}} and {{laminar airflow}} contribute to swing.
