5|$|The {{earliest}} accurate method <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> {{value of}} the Avogadro constant was based on coulometry.

5|$|A 2013 review {{said that}} there is enough {{suggestion}} of potential benefit from ketogenic diets in cancer therapy that establishing clinical trials is probably warranted.

5|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the speed of}} light is <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets.

5|$|Galileo, like Tycho before him, {{tried in}} vain <b>to</b> <b>measure</b> <b>the</b> {{parallax}} {{of this new}} star, and then argued against the Aristotelian view of an immutable heavens. The remnant of this supernova was identified in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
