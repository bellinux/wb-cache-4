Tapioca (มันสำปะหลัง; [...] ), besides being used as a food, the [...] "native starch" [...] it provides is used as a thickening agent and a stabilizer in many products. Native starch is a powder obtained from plants containing starch. Native starch is extracted from the root of the tapioca plant, which has the ability to grow in dry weather and low-nutrient soils where other crops do not grow well. <b>Tapioca</b> <b>roots</b> can be stored in the ground for up to 24 months, and some species for up to 36 months, thus harvest may be extended until market conditions are favourable or native starch production capacity is available.|$|E

50|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} for {{varying degrees of}} cultivation of maca in the Lake Junin region from around 1700 BC to 1200 AD. Maca has been harvested and used by humans in the puna grasslands of the Andean Mountains for centuries. Contrary to frequent claims that maca's cultivation was common in what is today Peru, until the late 1980s, maca has been cultivated only in a limited area around Lake Junin, in central Peru. Historically, maca often was traded for lowland tropical food staples, such as corn, rice, manioc (<b>tapioca</b> <b>roots),</b> quinoa, and papaya. It also {{was used as a}} form of payment of Spanish imperial taxes.Maca was eaten by Inca imperial warriors before battles. Their legendary strength was allegedly imparted by the preparatory consumption of copious amounts of maca, fueling formidable warriors. After a city was conquered, the women had to be protected from the Inca warriors, as reportedly they became ambitiously virile from eating such quantities of maca. This is an endorsement for the masculine angle of maca's recent marketing campaign. Whether or not this often-repeated legendary use is true has yet to be determined. Those who have studied maca's history {{have not been able to}} locate formal mention of this particular use historically.|$|E

40|$|This {{project has}} {{a goal to}} {{manufacture}} and characterise fully bio-degradable composite material based on polylactic acid (PLA) and wood pulp which {{has the potential to}} be used as components in the automotive industry. PLA is acting as the matrix and wood pulp as the reinforcing fibre. PLA has been chosen because it is a bio-based polymer which can be synthesized from agricultural products such as starch, <b>tapioca</b> <b>roots</b> or sugar cane. Its application are also foreseen to be enlarged from packaging material to electronic and structural applications. On the other hand, using wood pulp in structural components would allow the further development of Swedish forest industry. PLA has a glass transition temperature between 50 ºC and 65 ºC. Its mechanical properties are also decreased significantly by thermal degradation during melt processing. Recent research has shown that the end-all properties of PLA, for instance, mechanical properties and fire resistance, may be improved by using nanoparticles, such as nanoclay [1] [2]. In this project PLA is modified with the addition of nanoclay particles and chain extender. Two types of composites were therefore manufactured, one is composed of neat PLA and wood pulp, which is abbreviated as PW, and the other one is composed of nanoclay and chain extender modified PLA and wood pulp, which is abbreviated as (MPW). The composites were manufactured at Swerea SICPOMP in Piteå and the characterisation tests were carried out in Luleå University of Technology (LTU) in Luleå and Swerea SICOMP...|$|E

Reinforced biopolymer with natural fibres is the future of ‘‘green composites’’ addressing many sustainability issues. Among the available biopolymer, Polylactic acid (PLA) is the only natural resource polymer produced at a large scale of over 140, 000 tonnes per year. PLA is a biodegradable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch (in the United States and Canada), <b>tapioca</b> <b>roots,</b> chips or starch (mostly in Asia), or sugarcane (in the rest of the world). In 2010, PLA had the second highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world. Natural fibre reinforced PLA based biocomposites are widely investigated by the polymer scientists in the last decade to compete with non renewable petroleum based products. The type of fibre used {{plays an important role in}} fibre/matrix adhesion and thereby affects the mechanical performance of the biocomposites. For the processing of polymer nanocomposites, cellulose nanoparticles are an ideal candidate, because of their mechanical properties, reinforcing capabilities, abundance, low density, and biodegradability. Cellulose is probably the most used and well-known renewable and sustainable raw materialA comprehensive and exhaustive review was carried out based on the combination of nanocellulose with PLA to produce nanocomposite materials. The processing conditions to obtain the nanoscale materials are summarized and discussed. The main advantages and limitations of these nanomaterials are addressed. The addition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) to the biopolymers such as PLA, is pioneer of a new potential to create innovative bio-nanocomposite materials with improved properties and performance. However, safety issues of nanocellulose should be precisely monitored and controlled in order to confirm whether it has no harmful effects on human´s health and on environment. N/...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Polylactic acid or {{polylactide}} (PLA, Poly) is a biodegradable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester {{derived from}} renewable resources, such as corn starch, <b>tapioca</b> <b>roots,</b> chips or starch, or sugarcane. Biopolymer nanocomposites are {{of great interest}} to the packaging industry as they can overcome the limitations of biopolymers compared to synthetic polymers. In the last two decades, the nanocomposites have been studied intensively, once the addition of fillers such as organoclays, in particular, montmorillonite (MMT), can improve rheological, thermal and mechanical properties of the biopolymers (Jollands M. et al. 2010). The presence of MMT can lead to materials which generally exhibit great property enhancements, mainly due to its intercalation or exfoliation into the polymer chains. In this work, PLA was incorporated with 5 % (w/w) Cloisite Na+ prepared through a two-step process: first extrusion of pellets and secondly melted matter was pressed. The nanocomposite was used to pack a model food (salami) in order to evaluate of the ability of the new packaging to inhibit lipid oxidation. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) assay was used to evaluate the lipid oxidation stage. This assay allows to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which is formed in the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Material and Methods: Packaged salami was homogenized with trichloroacetic acid (10 %) in 0. 02 M of orthophosphoric acid and the solution was filtered. The filtered solution was homogenized with thiobarbituric acid aqueous solution (0. 02 M) and heated at 100 °C for 40 min. Solutions were cooled down and absorbance was measured at 530 nm. Results were expressed as mg MDA per kg of salami. Results and Discussion: Salami slices were packaged with a control film and with the nanocomposite and analysed at initial time and after 15, 30, 60 and 90 days of contact. Results showed that salami packaged with the nanocomposite presented lower amount of MDA after all contact periods, except after 60 days, where there were no differences between control and nanofilm. Conclusion: Although the results showed that the new nanocomposite tends to reduce the production of MDA, further studies should be carried out to confirm the inhibition of lipid oxidation, such as the peroxide index, p-anisidine value, or the monitorization of a lipid oxidation indicator like hexanal.

In vitro hydrolysis by α-amylase at 37 °C for 5 to 30 min was carried out and the same starches were also modified with 0. 5 N HCl at 37 ?C for 0. 75 to 3 h. Molecular weight of the starches decreased to 7 - 35 % of the respective initial values {{at the end of}} 5 min and down further to 3 - 15 % at the end of 30 min. Acid hydrolysis in comparison was very slow. At the end of 3 h, of the resultant starches was still 18 - 70 % of their initial. Degradative pattern of 20 min enzyme hydrolysed starches was studied by gel permeation chromatography on Sepharose CL- 6 B column. The carbohydrate content of the Fraction-I (void volume, Fr-I) decreased from 81 to 21 % after hydrolysis and that of Fraction-II (Fr-IIA and Fr-IIB) increased. The increase was more (from 4. 9 to 43. 4 %) in Fr-IIB (towards total volume). The in the peak of this fraction had a range of 2 x 10 3 to 9 x 10 3 indicating that the enzyme hydrolysis in non-granular state produced very low molecular weight dextrins in comparison to granular hydrolysis. The resistance for enzyme hydrolysis, in descending order was found to be finger millet, potato, chickpea, rice, sorghum, green gram, wheat, tapioca, waxy rice and maize. The λ max of iodine complex of enzyme hydrolysed fractions was low in comparison to their respective native fractions. Maximum drop of > 100 nm was noted in Fr-IIA, which had comparatively higher values for their respective native fractions indicating that hydrolysed product had many branch points. The higher λ max for peak of Fr-IIB indicated that carbohydrate content corresponding to this peak represented long linear chain fraction probably coming from external chains of the amylopectin molecule...|$|R
