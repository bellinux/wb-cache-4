5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> flee. Doggett pursues <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. <b>The</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man.</b> After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
5|$|Skinner remembers having seen, on {{numerous}} occasions, a bearded man {{who showed up}} suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme. He saves Skinner and sacrifices {{one of his own}} men. The case is closed and Skinner is, once again, aggravated with the agents, ordering them to report exclusively to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> was actually Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system.|$|E

5|$|In the present, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{discusses}} Fassl's release—due to DNA evidence—with an outraged Doggett. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{confirms that}} the test results conclusively disprove Fassl as the killer. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, Fassl notices a mysterious Bearded Man. After being released, he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> appears, Fassl begs for the man not to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.|$|E
25|$|On plate a, <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> {{holds in}} each hand a much smaller figure by the arm. Each of those two reach upward toward a small boar. Under {{the feet of the}} figures (on the {{shoulders}} of the larger man) are a dog on the left side and a winged horse on the right side.|$|E
25|$|At {{one end of}} the Great Ball Court is the North Temple, {{also known}} as the Temple of <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> <b>Man</b> (Templo del Hombre Barbado). This small masonry {{building}} has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair. At the south end is another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.|$|E

25|$|Art {{historian}} Lorne Campbell {{has identified}} {{the figures in}} the painting as (from left to right): Mary Cleophas (half-sister to the Virgin Mary); John the Evangelist, Mary Salome (in green, another half-sister of the Virgin Mary), The Virgin Mary (swooning), the corpse of Jesus Christ, Nicodemus (in red), a young man on the ladder – either a servant of Nicodemus or of Joseph of Arimathea, Joseph of Arimathea (in field-of-cloth-of-gold robes, the most sumptuous costume in the painting), <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> behind Joseph holding a jar and probably another servant and Mary Magdalene who adopts a dramatic pose {{on the right of}} the painting.|$|E
500|$|The lintel {{contains}} six reliefs {{from the}} New Testament of {{scenes from the}} Life of the Virgin. The first four, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Adoration of the Magi, are associated with motherhood and infancy. They are followed by the Resurrection and Pentecost. Above them, surmounting a [...] "cross flower", is the Coronation of the Virgin. The jambs {{on either side of}} the Virgin are adorned with statues, most likely of Old Testament prophets. Of these only David, second to the left, has been identified. <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> to David's left is probably Moses, the man in the cap to the right is most likely the [...] "weeping prophet" [...] Jeremiah. On the opposite side, the outer figures may be Zechariah and Isaiah.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pesci, {{improvisation}} and ad-libbing {{came out}} of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors {{came up with that}} he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him — the [...] "Funny how? Do I amuse you?" [...] scene — is based on an actual event that happened to Pesci. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Her painting of <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> with the dogs was based on a photograph from National Geographic magazine. The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot until a few weeks before it premiered. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.|$|E
5000|$|He {{became a}} star of the local society, and was {{featured}} in Jan Matejko's Battle of Grunwald (painting) in the lower right-hand section, as <b>the</b> young <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> with <b>the</b> white bandage on his head wound.|$|R
60|$|Which plan he (blinded by his master, Satan, so Jack phrased it) {{took into}} his head to impart to Ayacanora, as the partner of his tithes and offerings; and was {{exceedingly}} astonished to receive in answer a box on the ear, and a storm of abuse. After which, Ayacanora went to Amyas, and telling him all, proposed that the Piache should be thrown to the alligators, and Jack installed in his place; declaring that whatsoever <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>men</b> said must be true, and whosoever plotted against them should die the death.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{told him}} that <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> white <b>man</b> had left his village only the morning before, and that doubtless {{he would be able}} to {{overtake}} him in a short time. The other party the chief had not seen or heard of, so he said.|$|R
60|$|The minstrels melted away. <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> {{patted the}} fermenting monarch paternally on the shoulder.|$|E
60|$|He {{was about}} to speak when the young man {{anticipated}} him. Leaning forward, he addressed <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man,</b> who was crumbling bread with an absent look in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The first glass, {{as first}} glasses will, thawed <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man,</b> {{to the extent}} of {{inducing}} him to try and pick up the fragments of the conversation which he had shattered.|$|E
60|$|Prince Ludwig von der Tann {{turned toward}} <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> young <b>man.</b> Silence fell upon the crowded cathedral. Peter of Blentz stood {{awaiting}} the outcome, ready {{to demand the}} crown upon the first indication of wavering belief in the man he knew was not Leopold.|$|R
50|$|The two {{actors who}} portrayed the Garth killers are not listed {{anywhere}} in the credits, and their real names remain a mystery. However, on the film's DVD commentary, {{it was noted that}} they are both German nationals who spoke little or no English, and that one of them (<b>the</b> middle-aged <b>bearded</b> <b>man)</b> died shortly after the release of the film.|$|R
50|$|A pair of lamassus, bulls with <b>the</b> {{heads of}} <b>bearded</b> <b>men,</b> stand by <b>the</b> western threshold. Another pair, with wings and a Persian Head (Gopät-Shäh), {{stands by the}} eastern entrance, to reflect {{the power of the}} empire.|$|R
6000|$|... "What have I got to {{say about}} it?" [...] ejaculated <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man.</b> [...] "I've got a good deal to say about it, seems to me. Don't {{you know this is}} my private property?" ...|$|E
6000|$|At the word, up rose <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> in the Oriental robes,--the beautiful, {{the dark}} magician, who had bartered away his soul! He threw {{his arms around}} the Veiled Lady, and she was his bond-slave for evermore! ...|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} his {{impression}} was proved correct. The new-comer {{knocked on the}} door as all had done, but his reception was very different. <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> rose to his feet, and all the others followed suit. The German came forward and shook hands. His heels clicked together.|$|E
5000|$|The California Supreme Court {{set aside}} the conviction, criticising the {{statistical}} reasoning for ignoring dependencies between <b>the</b> characteristics, e.g., <b>bearded</b> <b>men</b> commonly sport moustaches.The court asserted that mathematics, [...] "...while assisting the trier of fact in the search of truth, must not cast a spell over him." ...|$|R
50|$|More recently, the British Army {{has been}} seen {{sporting}} {{a full range of}} stubble, moustaches and beards in Afghanistan in an effort to blend in with <b>the</b> generally <b>bearded</b> Afghan <b>men,</b> for whom a beard is seen as a sign of virility and authority.|$|R
50|$|The {{centre of}} the panel portrays Christ being carried {{up a flight of}} steps to the sepulchre, which was {{intended}} to be painted in the blank area at the top right of <b>the</b> work. <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> older <b>man</b> behind him is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who gave up his tomb for use as Christ's sepulchre. The long-haired figure on the left is probably Saint John, wearing a long orange-red gown, with one of the Marys (possibly Mary Magdalene) kneeling at his feet.|$|R
60|$|A great sigh {{seemed to}} sweep through the room. There {{was a long}} silence. Then, from the {{direction}} of the street, came the roar of a starting automobile. And at that sound <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> with the spectacles who had formed part of Miss Trimble's procession uttered a wailing cry.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man,</b> {{stripping}} to {{his waist}} and cutting off his trousers above the knee, fastened an {{end of the rope}} round his waist. The sailors stood ready one behind the other to pay it out. As a great wave rolled under the ship, he threw himself into the sea.|$|E
60|$|The {{corner of}} Central Park at Fifty-seventh Street {{was already in}} sight. <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> ran swiftly across the broad plaza and the sidewalk. Then he darted {{along the side of}} the Park and on to the path leading to the menagerie. In a moment more the {{darkness}} of the place swallowed him up.|$|E
50|$|The fresco's {{authenticity}} by Masaccio {{is proven}} by the perspective {{structure of the}} street flanked by medieval buildings (the first palazzo however is of a Renaissance style), the perfect realism {{of the old man}} and the cripple, and by the physiognomy of some recurring faces. John, behind Peter, allegedly has the features of Giovanni the Scheggia, Masaccio's brother, whereas <b>the</b> old <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> in <b>the</b> background should represent Donatello. The ashlar palazzo reminds of Palazzo Vecchio in the lower part, and Palazzo Pitti in the larger windows framed by brick stones.|$|R
50|$|There {{are obvious}} {{thematic}} and visual parallels with {{the statue of}} Jonah by Lorenzetto in the chapel. Both stories symbolize the escape from death {{by the grace of}} God, and death threatens both prophets {{in the form of a}} dangerous beast, in the case of Jonah, the whale and in the case of Daniel, the lion. The prophets are youthful, athletic heroes, more like ancient gods than <b>the</b> typical <b>bearded</b> <b>men</b> of <b>the</b> Old Testament. The head of Jonah was inspired by the ancient statues of Antinous; and Bernini also chose an ancient model for the head of Daniel, Alexander the Great.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 408, Huns being {{informed}} that Stilicho won't push Alaric I Visigoths into Illyricum, and East Roman troops were moved to the Persian frontier, they entered the Balkan and Thrace. Huns captured Castra Martis in Dacia Ripensis. Jerome mentioned them as feras gentes [...] "whose face and language are terrifying, who display womanly and deeply cut faces, and who pierce <b>the</b> backs of <b>bearded</b> <b>man</b> as they flee".|$|R
