5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, <b>turpentine</b> <b>oil</b> is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in <b>turpentine</b> <b>oil</b> if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E

The neutral fractions of gum oleoresins and <b>turpentine</b> <b>oils</b> mainly consisted of α-pinene, Δ- 3 -carene and β-pinene. A difference in chemical composition with locality was recognized for the <b>turpentine</b> <b>oils</b> and neutral fractions of gum oleoresins. While examining the chemical composition of the acidic fractions of gum oleoresins and rosins, we found that relative retention time could not be used to identify each resin acid. Based on mass spectral comparison, the major constituents of the acidic fractions and rosins were identified as sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, palustric acid, dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid, neoabietic acid and merkusic acid. The major component of the acidic fractions was palustric acid, while that of both rosin 1 and 2 was abietic acid. The chemical composition of the acidic fractions of gum oleoresins and rosins differed with locality.

In this work, the two kinetics models both the ideal and the non ideal solution assumption have been developed to quantitatively describe effects of hydration process of α-pinene in aqueous acid solution.

Methods: 30 healthy adult female rats was selected and divided into five groups. Animals were fed with normal diet, levothyroxine plus normal diet, and 5, 10, 20 percent of <b>turpentine</b> <b>oil</b> plus normal diet respectively. Duration of the study was one month sampling obtained in each ten day intervals. Hyperthyroidism was created in animals with dosage of 12 mg/l of levothyroxine in drinking water for one month. Rats treated with 5 %, 10 % and 20 % concentrations of wild pistachio oil for one month. Blood samples were collected from heart in each ten days interval. Results: No difference was observed in thyroid hormones and leptin in control group (P> 0. 05). With an increasing in <b>turpentine</b> <b>oil</b> in diet a significant reduction was obtained for T 4, T 3 and fT 4 respectively (P< 0. 05). A significant decrease also was observed with increase of 10 and 20 percent of <b>turpentine</b> <b>oil</b> in serum leptin level as compared to control group (P< 0. 05). There is a clear relationship between percent of <b>turpentine</b> <b>oil</b> feeding and thyroid and leptin hormone levels in experimental hyperthyroidism rats (P< 0. 05).
