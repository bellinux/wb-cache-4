25|$|The RAF Museum has two rockets, one {{displayed}} at the museum's London site and one at the Cosford site. The museum also owns a Meillerwagen, a Vidalwagen, a Strabo crane, and a firing table with <b>towing</b> <b>dolly.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{semi-trailer}} {{designed as}} automobile rescue equipment. It {{is designed to}} couple to the concerned automobile's powered wheel, i.e. the front wheel of a Front-wheel drive automobile, or the rear wheel of a rear-wheel drive automobile, by locking the powered wheels onto the <b>tow</b> <b>dolly's</b> tray. The <b>tow</b> <b>dolly</b> is <b>tow</b> hitch connected to a tractor or truck. <b>Tow</b> <b>dollies</b> are legal in all 50 US states and Canada. In the U.S. and Canada brakes are required on any loaded car <b>tow</b> <b>dolly.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stunt cars, camera cars, <b>tow</b> cars, <b>dolly</b> cars, {{and cars}} used for [...] "beauty" [...] shots varied in model year from 1974 to 1976 Ford Torinos, since the body {{style of the}} Gran Torino was unchanged.|$|R
50|$|Others {{range from}} two-axle campers {{that can be}} pulled by most mid-sized pickups to {{trailers}} that are {{as long as the}} host country's law allows for drivers without special permits. Larger campers tend to be fully integrated recreational vehicles, which often are used to <b>tow</b> single-axle <b>dolly</b> trailers to allow the driver to bring small cars on their travels.|$|R
50|$|It was {{expensive}} for a kids' show, {{but most of}} the budget (about $9,000 per episode) went into aircraft, vehicles, fuel, and sets. This meant that some standard production methods had to be abandoned, giving the series a more realistic look. For instance, in some shots, pilot Bill Fergusson actually did taxi the 310B rather than the more common (but time-consuming and costly) method of simulating movement by <b>towing</b> or <b>dolly</b> shots. Plymouth provided several 1951 woodie station wagons for the series.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{location}} for a Canadian National Railway roundhouse, the rail-yard operations were closed {{down in the}} early 1950s when the CNR switched to diesel and electrics from steam. At this time Ontario Central Airlines, owned by Barney Lamb, established a maintenance facility in the old roundhouse for its fleet of amphibious charter aircraft. The old switch yard {{was used as a}} landing strip for wheel aircraft after the tracks had been pulled. At this time the inflow to Corn Lake (the MacFarlane River) was dredged, and a control dam constructed at the out flow of Ena Lake to ensure an adequate water depth for the landing of amphibious aircraft, which were then <b>towed</b> by <b>dolly</b> to the former roundhouse for maintenance.|$|R
40|$|A {{high-speed}} path-following controller {{for long}} combination vehicles (LCVs) {{was designed and}} implemented on a test vehicle consisting of a rigid truck <b>towing</b> a <b>dolly</b> and a semitrailer. The vehicle was driven through a 3. 5 [*]m wide lane change maneuver at 80 [*]km/h. The axles of the dolly and trailer were steered actively by electrically-controlled hydraulic actuators. Substantial performance benefits were recorded compared with the unsteered vehicle. For the best controller weightings, performance improvements relative to unsteered case were: lateral tracking error 75 % reduction, rearward amplification (RA) of lateral acceleration 18 % reduction, and RA of yaw rate 37 % reduction. This represents a substantial improvement in stability margins. The system was found to work well {{in conjunction with the}} braking-based stability control system of the towing vehicle with no negative interaction effects being observed. In all cases, the stability control system and the steering system improved the yaw stability of the combination...|$|R
5000|$|Endeavour {{encountered}} a few obstacles while transiting the streets narrowly missing telephone poles, apartment buildings and other structures. The lack of obstacles was due, in part, {{to the fact}} that over 400 old-growth shade trees had been cut down beforehand. The power had to be turned off and power carrying poles had to be removed temporarily as the orbiter crept along Manchester to Prairie Avenue then Crenshaw Boulevard. News crews lined the streets along the path with visible news personalities in the news trucks. There were several police escorts as well as considerable security helping to control the large crowds gathered. Endeavour was parked for a few hours at the Great Western Forum where it was available for viewing. The journey was famous for an unmodified Toyota Tundra pickup truck pulling the space shuttle across the Manchester Boulevard Bridge. The space shuttle was mainly carried by four self-propelled robotic dollies throughout the 12 mile journey. However, due to bridge weight restrictions, the space shuttle was moved onto the <b>dolly</b> <b>towed</b> by the Tundra. After it had completely crossed the bridge, the Space Shuttle was returned to the robotic dollies. The footage was later used in a commercial for the 2013 Super Bowl. [...] Having taken longer than expected, Endeavour finally reached the Science Center on October 14.|$|R
