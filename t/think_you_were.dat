He [...] said, 'I wouldn't {{put you in the}} team if I didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> good enough'. He was a father figure as well because I was homesick.

500|$|For {{several years}} between 1956 and 1959, the comedian and TV {{presenter}} Dave Allen {{worked as a}} Redcoat at the camp. For Allen {{it was his first}} experience of fame (within the community of campers) and he found that he could not escape it, saying, [...] "You can't get away once they know youunless you lock yourself in your chalet.

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Down Beat magazine found Waters's singing [...] "forced and artificial", writing that Folk Singer {{suffers from a}} major flaw: [...] "He only begins to {{come close to the}} power and unforced intensity of the original numbers and style from time to time, as on 'You Gonna Need My Help' and 'My Home Is in the Delta'". In a retrospective review, Cub Koda, writing for AllMusic was more enthusiastic, deeming the record's sound fresh and vital. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Folk Singer number 280 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of AllTime", writing that the [...] "unplugged" [...] playing was pioneering and has since been [...] "beloved by blues and folk fans alike". In a 1994 issue of Rolling Stone, a reviewer wrote, [...] "...There aren't too many blues albums that qualify as audiophile recordings, but Muddy Waters Folk Singer surely does. A wonderfully intimate session, it delivers Waters' voice in all its power and subtlety, while rendering his guitar work...with such vivid realism, you would <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sitting in the studio...." ...|$|E

500|$|Among major {{metropolitan}} weeklies, David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film [...] "a shapely piece of mythmaking [...] Favreau doesn't {{go in for}} stylized comic-book frames, {{at least in the}} first half. He gets real with it â€“ you'd <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> watching a military thriller", while conversely, David Denby of The New Yorker put forth a negative review, claiming [...] "a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's girl Friday, who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted". IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as [...] "the best thing" [...] in a film that [...] "functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles". Noting the cultural elements of the film, Cristobal Giraldez Catalan of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote, [...] "Iron Man is far more than playboy fantasy; it is American foreign policy realized without context [...] with narrative and directorial precision, once again provides the high-fidelity misogyny and anti-Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameZone's Louis Bedigian {{scored the}} game 8.4 out of 10, feeling [...] "Dark Cloud 2 {{includes}} many annoyances {{that were not}} present in the first game, such as a longer, cheesier storyline; dorkier characters; and voice-overs that are so traumatizing you'll <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> watching an episode of Blue's Clues." [...] He concluded that [...] "For all its annoyances, Dark Cloud 2 is still a really, really good game. [...] I love the battles, I love the Georama system, and I love being able to build my own weapons. But I am also very disappointed in the direction that was taken with the story. Most PlayStation 2 owners are adults [...] The gameplay is so challenging that it's unlikely that a six-year-old will even care about it. But the childish voices are so annoying that this game will almost certainly turn off {{a large number of}} hardcore gamers who would have otherwise loved it." ...|$|E
