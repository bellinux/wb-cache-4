2500|$|McKay {{is one of}} {{the more}} active Members of the Canadian Parliament on the issue of aid to {{developing}} nations, having been the Vice President of CIDO; an organization devoted the development of microfinancing in developing nations. In 2007 McKay travelled with Michael Savage M.P. (Liberal), Alexa McDonough M.P. (NDP), and Bill Casey M.P. (Conservative) to Kenya as part of a Parliamentary envoy to assess the efficacy and potential of ODA in developing nations. Though C-293 had been introduced prior to the trip, according to McKay the Kenyan sojourn gave greater urgency to the need for ODA reform. “We did not come away with easy answers regarding development and poverty, but a much clearer sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> the capacity for meaningful change.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Popular atheist {{author and}} Vanity Fair writer Christopher Hitchens remarked {{on the program}} Uncommon Knowledge: [...] "I think our {{knowledge}} {{of right and wrong}} is innate in us. Religion gets its morality from humans. We know that we can't get along if we permit perjury, theft, murder, rape, all societies at all times, well before the advent of monarchies and certainly, have forbidden it... Socrates called his daemon, it was an inner voice that stopped him when he was trying to take advantage of someone...

50|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} source on early Roman history is the Roman historian Titus Livius (59 BC - 17 AD), usually called Livy in English literature, who wrote a history known as Ab Urbe Condita (From the Foundation of the City) covering the entirety of Rome's history from her mythical origins up to his own times in 142 books. Of these only books 1-10 and 21-45 have survived down to our times, covering the years from the foundation up to 293 and 220 --- 167 BC. However summaries of the lost books have been preserved, and later historians such as Florus, Eutropius and Orosius used Livy as their source, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> some knowledge {{of the contents of}} the lost books.|$|E
5000|$|As {{psychological}} {{research has}} improved immensely since Broadbent's time, more sophisticated measures indicate <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> an attentional filter, {{though it is}} integrated into a broader cognitive system. This system compensates for the controversies of limited parallel processing in Broadbent's original findings. A major component of the system entails sensory memory, which is broken down into iconic memory and echoic memory. The aforementioned represent visual and auditory memory respectively, which function preattentively. Given {{the existence of such}} a preattentive memory store makes it possible for preattentive stimuli to work in a serial manner. [...] Research on iconic memory has provided a visual hierarchy of the visual system, which indicates specific neurons are activated before stimulus recognition, supporting Broadbent's theory of preattentive processing.|$|E
5000|$|The Detroit rapper {{also stated}} that the lyrics and the music came {{together}} {{in a way that}} made them want to generate maximum interest in the self-titled début. Royce continued: [...] "All the push back has to do with is the set up. It's great music. My biggest concern with making the project is us picking the best beats possible. Rhyming is there. The best music possible is what I was always concerned with, that’s why a lot of songs came out so good. Joell Ortiz, a Brooklyn-bred artist, said that the process of creating the album was arduous, yet fun. [...] "It was definitely the busiest session I had ever been in my life. To come out with the product <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have,</b> was ridiculous." ...|$|E

5000|$|After six {{new books}} on the great Canadian problem — our lack of unity and {{identity}} — are we getting any nearer {{the source of the}} problem? Undoubtedly something is achieved: if nothing else one can wonder if the search is worth the effort. Certainly we should continue to try to understand ourselves; an unexamined nation is not worth living in. But {{it may be that the}} frame of reference is wrong. Perhaps instead of constantly deploring our lack of identity, we should attempt to understand and explain the regional, ethnic and class identities <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have.</b> It might just be that it is in these limited identities that [...] "Canadianism" [...] is found, and that except for our over-heated nationalist intellectuals, Canadians find this situation quite satisfactory.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Fijian government's {{request for}} a police investigation, Fiji Commissioner of Police Andrew Hughes told the media that [...] "nothing that police {{received}} gave credence or legitimacy to the organisation and Mr Scott ... What we {{can say is that}} the information <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> at hand leads us to conclude that the proposed transaction is highly irregular, it is questionable and leaves me with a profound level of suspicion." [...] He urged the Fijian parties to the OITC deal not to [...] "send any money if it's requested as some form of an advanced fee for this transaction to proceed" [...] (the sending of advance fees is a widely used method of fraud). He also disclosed that Keith Scott was [...] "known by Australian authorities", though he was not at liberty to provide further details.|$|E

"We had {{no money}} but time was a luxury <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>have.</b> So <b>we</b> spent a year planning, then {{recording}} it ourselves, and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> all the artwork ourselves too. Even our website was designed by us. We got a book out of the library so we could learn how to <b>do</b> it. Then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to <b>do</b> it again cos it was a right palaver [...] So after all that, things took off really quickly and went crazy {{in the space of}} two months, which was quite surprising." ...|$|R

5000|$|In March 2014, Creative Minds {{organised}} {{a conference}} at Brighton Dome, bringing together arts organisations, venues, producers, critics and learning disabled artists and performers. Arts critic Bella Todd discussed the issues raised: 'It’s a bold question to pose, {{especially at a}} time when funding cuts conspire to put all creative organisations on the defensive: how do we perceive, discuss and measure quality in work by artists with learning disabilities?....It was the kind of conference, inevitably, where every answer seeds two more questions, complicated by the fact we’re lumping together artists with diverse disabilities, working in different art forms, with varying levels of professional engagement. And that’s before you get started on the subject of how we decide any art is ‘good’ in the first place. But I came away feeling how vital it is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> this conversation.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Archaeology gives a {{different}} settlement picture to that {{indicated by the}} South Saxon foundation story. Germanic tribes probably first arrived in Sussex earlier in the 5th century than AD 477. [...] The archaeological evidence <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> indicates the area of settlement by the location of cemeteries of the period. The origins of the settlers can be derived by comparing the design of grave goods and pottery with the designs of similar items in the German homelands. The principal area of settlement in the 5th century {{has been identified as}} between the lower Ouse and Cuckmere rivers in East Sussex, {{based on the number of}} Anglo-Saxon cemeteries there.; However exceptionally there are two cemeteries in West Sussex at Highdown, near Worthing and Apple Down, 11 km or 7 miles north west of Chichester. The area between the Ouse and Cuckmere was believed to have been the location for the federate treaty settlement of Anglo-Saxon mercenaries. [...] Whatever the original settlement pattern of the early Germanic settlers, the culture of these settlers came to rapidly dominate the whole of Sussex.|$|E
5000|$|Direct realists can {{potentially}} deny {{the existence of}} any {{such thing as a}} mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid's, is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an [...] "external object" [...] is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.|$|E
