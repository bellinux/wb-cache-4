40|$|Abstract. We revisit quantum {{institutions}} as in [2] and solve some problems identified therein. Global, probabilistic and quantum exogenous enrichments of logics are adapted {{to a new}} notion of global model.

It also provides suitable <b>constructions</b> for studying <b>the</b> relationship between these enrichments and compare them with <b>the</b> <b>constructions</b> of [2].

5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker.

The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> at Sæter, the trams turned at Bråten and backed to Sæter, where they used the turning loop.
