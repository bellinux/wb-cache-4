5|$|During {{this period}} Argentina's economy {{continued}} to grow, on average, but more slowly <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{as a whole}} or than its neighbours, Brazil and Chile. A suggested cause is that a multitude of frequently changed regulations, at times extended to ridiculous specifics (such as a 1947 decree setting prices and menus for restaurants), choked economic activity. The long-term effect was to create pervasive disregard for the law, which Argentines came to view as a hindrance to earning a living rather than an aid to enforcing legitimate property rights. The combination of industrial protectionism, redistribution of income from the agrarian to the industrial sector, and growing state intervention in the economy sparked an inflationary process. By 1950, Argentina's GDP per capita accounted just {{nearly half of the}} United States.|$|E

5|$|In the final, Australia made a poor start; Dawn Fraser almost {{stopped when}} she heard a second gunshot, believing that a false start had occurred. She {{finished}} her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, two seconds slower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> record she set in the individual 100-metre final, but with a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska.

Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds, with the Australian lead cut to 0.9 of a second. Even with the advantage of a flying start, Leech's leg was 0.4 of a second slower than her fastest time during the individual competition.|$|E

25|$|Interpretations where quantum {{mechanics}} is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking. Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, {{rather than as an}} objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to instrumentalism.|$|E

25|$|According to MINAG, {{the cost}} of minor and major {{irrigation}} infrastructure in Peru is 11% and 48% higher, respectively, <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> average. Decentralization, together {{with the development of}} water resources management and irrigation institutions, created a multitude of entities responsible for irrigation investments at the national, regional, and local levels. The National Government has been investing in major irrigation infrastructure, mostly located in the coastal region although it plans to extend its efforts to the highlands as well. According to 2000 data, the National Government invested US$3.468 million to develop irrigation schemes in ten coastal projects.|$|E

Seven other provinces each have about one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Entre Ríos, Salta, Chaco, Corrientes and Misiones. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 60 inhabitants/km², the only Argentine province more densely populated <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has less than 1 inhabitant/km².|$|E

25|$|The highest {{background}} radiation in an inhabited area {{is found in}} Ramsar, primarily due {{to the use of}} local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material. The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external effective radiation dose of 6mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources. They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal committed dose from radon was 72mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr). This unique case is over 80 times higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> average natural human exposure to radiation.|$|E

The matches in the Champions Trophy are held over a period of around two and a half weeks, while the World Cup can last for over a month. The number of teams in the Champions Trophy are much less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup, with the latest edition of the World Cup having 14 teams whereas the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy had 8 teams.|$|E
