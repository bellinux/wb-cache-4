In the meantime, {{on the evening of}} 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt.

5|$|Following Jutland, Barham {{was under}} repair until 5 July 1916. On {{the evening of}} 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers while the Germans mustered 18 dreadnoughts and 2 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where they expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, the British turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats unless the odds of defeating the High Seas Fleet in a decisive engagement were favourable.|$|E

25|$|The British Army first {{engaged the}} German Army in the Battle of Mons on 23 August 1914, which {{was part of}} the greater Battle of the Frontiers. The massed rifle fire of the {{professional}} British soldiers inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans who attacked en masse over terrain devoid of cover. The British held up the German advance until <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> they began retiring to a second defensive line in the retreat from Mons during which they were engaged in the Battle of Le Cateau.

25|$|Homeless shelters, which {{generally}} are night shelters, make people {{leave in the}} morning to whatever they could manage and return in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping.

An example of such a day center shelter model is Saint Francis House in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in the early 1980s, which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model.|$|E
25|$|While {{the control}} of the {{railroad}} included control of Vanderbilt's ferry, the North Shore Ferry was leased separately and was operated by John H. Starin. His lease was set to expire on May 1, 1884. On July 18, 1884, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company outbid Starin for the North Shore operation. As part of the purchase, ferry service would have been operated every forty minutes instead of an hour. The fare for the railroad and the ferry would have been ten cents, except between the hours of five and seven in the morning, and between five and seven in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> the fare would have been seven cents.

There was no funeral prayer. A fortnight later, his body was laid beside that of Sir Thomas More in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London. Fisher's head was stuck upon a pole on London Bridge but its ruddy and lifelike appearance excited so much attention that, after a fortnight, it was thrown into the Thames, its place being taken by that of Sir Thomas More, whose execution, also at Tower Hill, occurred on 6 July.|$|E

He returned to Australia on 30 December 1915 and took no further part in the fighting, it being [...] "a rigid rule that no regular officer once invalided to Australia could again go overseas".
