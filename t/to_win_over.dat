5|$|According to scholar Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, {{the legend}} of Banai has close {{parallels}} {{with the story of}} King Dushyanta and Shakuntala from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The tale of another folk god Mhaskoba (Bhairava) to gain his wife Balurani or Balai despite obstacles is also similar to Khandoba's endeavour <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> Banai.|$|E
5|$|Since , Cain was one {{of three}} {{starting}} pitchers in the starting rotation, along with Tim Lincecum and Madison Bumgarner, <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> one hundred games. In that span, the San Francisco Giants are the only Major League team to accomplish the feat, according to NBC Sports Bay Area.|$|E

50|$|Summerhill {{started off}} their finals on 21 August 2011, with a 2-10 <b>to</b> 0-12 <b>win</b> <b>over</b> Navan O'Mahony's. In the semi-finals they faced Group A winners Wolfe Tones, the match was played on 11 September and Summerhill had a 1-7 <b>to</b> 0-6 <b>win</b> <b>over</b> Wolfe Tones. This {{qualified}} {{them for their}} first final since 2008.|$|R
5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea {{to crush the}} revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the other state's allies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split {{itself and the}} columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, as suggested by Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|March 1957. Guevara {{deals with}} {{debilitating}} bouts of asthma as his group of revolutionaries {{meet up with}} Castro’s. Together, they attack an army barracks in the Sierra Maestra on May 28, 1957. After that, they begin <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the rural peasant population of Cuba and receive increasing support, while battling both the government and traitors in their midst. Gradually, however, the government loses control {{of most of the}} rural areas. Soon afterward, the July 26th Movement forges alliances with other revolutionary movements in Cuba, and begin to assault towns and villages. Most fall to the rebels with little to no resistance.|$|E
50|$|In July Toomua won {{his second}} Australian Schools Championship, guiding Queensland I to a come-from-behind 23-17 <b>win</b> <b>over</b> NSW I in Canberra. His {{performance}} during the tournament {{earned him the}} pivot's role for the Australian Schoolboys where he helped guide the side <b>to</b> <b>wins</b> <b>over</b> the England Under 18s (11-3), Samoan Schools (50-9) and a 23-17 <b>win</b> <b>over</b> New Zealand Schools in Sydney, the side's first <b>win</b> <b>over</b> their trans-Tasman rivals since 1997.|$|R

Marino finished with 2,210 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and six interceptions. With the division wrapped up following a 26-17 <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the Oilers at the Astrodome Marino sat for the final two games of the season as Don Strock quarterbacked the Dolphins <b>to</b> <b>wins</b> <b>over</b> the Falcons and Jets.|$|R
5|$|Robert conscripted all men of a {{fighting}} age into the army, which he refitted. Meanwhile, he sent an {{ambassador to the}} Byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for Helena and <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the Domestic of the Schools, Alexios. The results of these attempts remain unknown, but the ambassador fell under Alexios's charm and as he was returning to Italy, he heard of Alexios's successful coup against Botaneiates, by which he became Alexios I Komnenos.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E

5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and even managed to raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ on top of one of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E
5|$|The artist {{emerged in}} 1489 {{as part of}} the {{cultural}} world of Milan, beginning a successful career that turned him into a leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Martinengo mausoleum. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical taste, as opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During {{the first decade of the}} sixteenth century, Gasparo was able <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> public and private clients who sought to translate into stone their pride in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his heart attack, in early 1991 Ryzhkov stood as the Communist {{candidate in the}} first election of the President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). At the election on 12 June 1991, he gained 13,395,335 votes, equal to 16.9% of the electorate. Boris Yeltsin beat him decisively with 57%. Ryzhkov's vice presidential candidate was Boris Gromov, a Soviet war veteran who led the Soviet military during {{the final stages of}} the war in Afghanistan. Most of Ryzhkov's votes came from the countryside, while he had hoped <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> voters who were becoming increasingly disenfranchised as a result of perestroika and Gorbachev's leadership, even though the latter supported his candidacy.|$|E
5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. <b>To</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
50|$|He {{first made}} the Canterbury side in 1979, {{initially}} as a Loose Forward {{but he soon}} shifted to the Hooker position after an injury to Alan Rushton.

Sreenath and Amritha go to their village in Kerala to influence him and <b>win</b> <b>over</b> her parents. But things go awry after Amritha’s father starts hating Sreenath due to his hyperactive and overenthusiastic nature. After all his efforts <b>to</b> <b>win</b> him <b>over.</b>|$|R

5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{network of}} allies in Normandy became {{stronger}} during 1103. Henry married Juliana, {{one of his}} illegitimate daughters, to Eustace of Breteuil, and another illegitimate daughter, Matilda, to Rotrou, the Count of Perche, on the Normandy border. Henry attempted <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>over</b> {{other members of the}} Normandy nobility and gave other English estates and lucrative offers to key Norman lords. Duke Robert continued to fight Robert of Bellême, but the Duke's position worsened, until by 1104, he had to ally himself formally with Bellême to survive. Arguing that Duke Robert had broken the terms of their treaty, Henry crossed over the Channel to Domfront, where he met with senior barons from across Normandy, eager to ally themselves with the King. Henry confronted his brother and accused him of siding with his enemies, before returning to England.|$|E
