40|$|Polycystic {{liver disease}} is a well-described manifestation of {{autosomal}} dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). <b>Biliary</b> <b>tract</b> complications are less well-recognised. We report a 50 -year single-centre experience of 1, 007 patients, which raised a hypothesis that ADPKD is associated with <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease. This was then tested using all-England Hospital Episode Statistics data (1998 - 2012) within which 23, 454 people recorded as having ADPKD and 6, 412, 754 hospital controls were identified. Hospitalisation rates <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease, serious liver complications {{and a range of}} other known ADPKD manifestations were adjusted for potential confounders and then compared. Compared to non-ADPKD hospital controls, the rates of admission <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease were 2. 2 -times higher in those with ADPKD (rate ratio [RR] 2. 24, 95 % confidence interval 2. 16 - 2. 33) and 4. 7 -times higher for serious liver complications (RR 4. 67, 4. 35 - 5. 02). When analyses were restricted to those on maintenance dialysis or with a kidney transplant, RRs attenuated substantially, but ADPKD remained positively associated with both <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease (RR 1. 19, 1. 08 - 1. 31) and with serious liver complications (RR 1. 15, 0. 98 - 1. 33). The ADPKD versus non-ADPKD hospital control RRs <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease were larger for men than women (heterogeneity p< 0. 001), but RRs for serious liver complications appeared higher in women (heterogeneity p< 0. 001). The absolute excess risk of <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease associated with ADPKD (0. 73 %/year) was larger than for serious liver disease (0. 24 %/year), cerebral aneurysms (0. 11 %/year), or inguinal hernias (0. 11 %/year), but less than for urinary tract infections (2. 20 %/year). <b>Biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease appears to be a distinct and important extra-renal complication of ADPKD. </p...|$|R

Of the total, 18. 6 % underwent resection: mean age was 69. 3 years (median 70. 0); 60. 8 % were female; 73. 7 % were white. Overall inpatient surgical mortality was 5. 6 %. Independently predictive factors of mortality included patient age ≥ 50 (vs. < 50; age 50 – 59 odds ratio [OR] 5. 51, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 70 – 17. 93; age 60 – 69 OR 7. 25, 95 % CI 2. 29 – 22. 96; age≥ 70 OR 9. 03, 95 % CI 2. 86 – 28. 56), the presence of identified comorbidities (congestive heart failure, OR 3. 67, 95 % CI 2. 61 – 5. 16; renal failure, OR 4. 72, 95 % CI 2. 97 – 7. 49), and admission designated as emergent (vs. elective; OR 1. 82, 95 % CI 1. 39 – 2. 37).

40|$|Background: Acute {{and chronic}} {{cholecystitis}} and cholangitis are common cases in general surgical diseases. Considering {{the role of}} infections in pathogenesis of these diseases, prescribing appropriate antibiotics is important to control the <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> infections. The {{aim of this study}} was to recognize the biliary pathogens as well as evaluate their antibiotic susceptibility in cholecystectomized patients. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 288 cholecystectomized patients with acute and chronic cholecystitis and cholangitis. During the operation, a sterile bile sample was aspirated from the gallbladder which was sent to the laboratory for culture and antibiogram evaluation. Results: Sixty-two (21. 5) patients were positive for bile culture. There were more positive cultures in cholangitis cases (64. 7) than the acute and chronic cholecystitis (22. 8, 12. 2, respectively P= 0. 001). Thirty-six isolated pathogens were E. coli (58) and 8 Klebsiella (12. 9). Moreover, the most effective antibiotics against the gram-negative bacteria: imipenem (100), amikacin (98. 1) and gentamicin (90. 4) and for gram-positive bacteria: imipenem, vancomycin, rifampcin and clindamycin. Conclusion: The third-generation cephalosporins, as an empirical treatment <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> infections, lack the effective antibiotic susceptibility. Considering the high susceptibility (more than 90) and the reasonable price of amikacin and gentamicin, cephalosporins are recommended as the first line treatment <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> infection. Imipenem, an expensive broad-spectrum antibiotic, is not recommended as the first line treatment to avoid drug resistance...|$|R
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to establish effective chemotherapy to improve the survival of patients with <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer, because most of these patients are unsuitable candidates for surgery, and even patients undergoing curative surgery often have recurrence. Recently, the combination of cisplatin plus gemcitabine was reported to show survival benefits over gemcitabine alone in randomized clinical trials conducted in the United Kingdom and Japan. Thus, the combination of cisplatin plus gemcitabine is now recognized as the standard therapy <b>for</b> unresectable <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer. One of the next issues {{that need to be}} addressed is whether molecular targeted agents might also be effective against <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer. Although some targeted agents have been investigated as monotherapy for first-line chemotherapy, none were found to exert satisfactory efficacy. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab and cetuximab have also been investigated in combination with a gemcitabine-based regimen and have been demonstrated to show promising activity. Furthermore, clinical trials using new targeted agents <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer are also proposed. This cancer is a relatively rare and heterogeneous tumor consisting of cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma. Therefore, a large randomized clinical trial {{is necessary}} to confirm the efficacy of chemotherapy, and international collaboration is important...|$|R
40|$|Pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) is a {{high risk}} factor <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer. In PBM, since the {{pancreatic}} duct and bile duct converge outside the duodenal wall beyond {{the influence of the}} sphincter of Oddi, pancreatic juice and bile are constantly mixed, producing a variety of harmful substances. Because of this, the biliary mucosa is repeatedly damaged and repaired, which causes an acceleration of cell proliferative activity and multiple gene mutations. Histological changes such as hyperplasia, metaplasia, and dysplasia ultimately result in a high incidence of carcinogenesis. In a nationwide survey by the Japanese Study Group on PBM, coexisting <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer was detected in 278 of the 1627 registered cases of PBM (17. 1 %). Of these cases, i...|$|R
40|$|<b>Biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancers include cancers of the {{gallbladder}} and extrahepatic bile ducts, and its {{prognosis is}} poor. The anterior gradient 2 (AGR 2) is a protein disulfide isomerase and is highly expressed in various human cancers, such as breast, prostate and pancreas cancers. AGR 2 {{is expressed in}} normal cholangiocytes and its expression is maintained during biliary carcinogenesis. However, the clinical significance of AGR 2 expression in <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer {{has not yet been}} assessed. Thus, we examined the expression of AGR 2 protein in <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> tumors using immunohistochemistry and its association with various clinicopathologic parameters. This study included 100 patients who underwent surgery <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancers: 46 men and 54 women with a mean and median age of 64. 2 and 65. 0 years, respectively. AGR 2 expression was detected in ductal epithelial cells of the normal <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> and in 95 % of <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer tissues.

40|$|Few {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) {{with large numbers}} of patients have been conducted to date in patients with <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer, and standard chemotherapy has not been established yet. In this article we review previous studies and clinical trials regarding chemotherapy <b>for</b> unresectable <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer, and we present guidelines for the appropriate use of chemotherapy in patients with <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer. According to an RCT comparing chemotherapy and best supportive care for these patients, survival was significantly longer and quality of life was significantly better in the chemotherapy group than in the control group. Thus, chemotherapy <b>for</b> patients with <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer seems to be a significant treatment of choice. However, chemotherapy <b>for</b> patients with <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer should be indicated for those with unresectable, locally advanced disease or distant metastasis, or for those with recurrence after resection. That is why making the diagnosis of unresectable disease should be done with greatest care. As a rule, pathological diagnosis, including cytology or histopathological diagnosis, is preferable. Chemotherapy is recommended in patients with a good general condition, because in patients with general deterioration, such as those with a performance status of 2 or 3 or those with insufficient biliary decompression, the benefit of chemotherapy is limited. As chemotherapy <b>for</b> unresectable <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer, the use of gemcitabine or tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium is recommended. As postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, no effective adjuvant therapy has been established at the present time. It is recommended that further clinical trials, especially large multi-institutional RCTs (phase III studies) using novel agents such as gemcitabine should be performed as soon as possible in order to establish a standard treatment...|$|R

50|$|<b>Biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease {{produces}} relatively greater {{increases in}} ALP than increases in ALT, AST, or LD. ALP {{is associated with}} the plasma membrane of hepatocytes adjacent to the biliary canaliculus. Obstruction or inflammation of the <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> results in an increased concentration of the ALP in the circulation. Similar to ALT and AST, ALP is not specific <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease. ALP is released by osteoblasts, the ileum, and the placenta. ALP is elevated: 1) in children 2- to 3-fold over adults because the child's skeleton is growing, 2) with bone disease involving osteoblasts (e.g., metastatic cancer or following a fracture), 3) in hyperparathyroidism where parathyroid hormone stimulates osteoblasts through a series of steps that enhances bone resorption (e.g., parathyroid adenoma, hyperplasia, or secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency or renal disease), 4) in cases of ileal disease, and 5) during the third trimester of pregnancy because the placental isoenzyme is elevated.|$|R
40|$|Post-operative <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> {{injuries}} {{have traditionally}} been treated by surgery; since the 1990 s, however, this was replaced by endoscopic methods. These complications occur most frequently after laparoscopic surgery. Whenever biliary leakage is suspected, a close cooperation between endoscopists and surgeons is essential. Immediate visualisation of the <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is mandatory to confi rm the diagnosis and locate the exact site of the lesion. Various endoscopic techniques {{have proven to be}} effective in the treatment of post-cholecystectomy biliary leaks. The crucial point is to equalise duodenal and <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> pressures so that bile fl ow into the duodenum is ensured and healing of the lesion is facilitated. This can be achieved by endoscopic sphincterotomy either alone or in combination with subsequent implantation of a plastic stent. These methods seem to be equally suitable; for greater lesions, however, insertion of a stent is advisable. <b>For</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> strictures, multiple stenting is recommended, the results of which are promising in the long run as well...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{ras gene}} family (H-ras, N-ras and K-ras) are oncogenes that mutate {{frequently}} in human cancer, specially in {{tumors of the}} <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> and pancreas. Aim: To determine the frequency of K-ras gene codon 12 mutation in pancreatic and biliary tumors. Material and Methods: Samples of 35 gallbladder, 15 ampulla of Vater, 10 <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> and 9 pancreatic tumors, were analyzed. The tumor tissue was microdissected from paraffin embedded biopsies. The mutation was detected {{by a combination of}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Results: Overall, 46 % of samples had K-ras gene mutations. Mutation frequency was 80, 56, 50 and 29 % for ampulla of Vater, pancreatic, <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> and gallbladder tumors, respectively. When compared with the rest, gallbladder tumors had a significantly lower frequency of the mutation. Median survival <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> tumors was 6 months, compared with 65 months for gallbladder tumors (p < 0. 05).

Pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) was also identified. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography also showed an enhanced nodule in the CBD, and we suspected intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. We performed pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. Postoperative pathological examination revealed an inflammatory polyp in the middle CBD.

40|$|Background <b>Biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer (BTC) {{patients}} who have undergone surgical resection with major hepa-tectomy cannot tolerate the standard gemcitabine regimen (1, 000 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) due to severe toxicities such as myelosuppression. Our dose-finding study of adjuvant gemcitabine therapy <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer following major hepatectomy determined that the recommended dose is 1, 000 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 15 every 4 weeks. Here, we evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gemcitabine in these subjects. Methods We evaluated BTC patients scheduled to undergo surgical resection with major hepatec-tomy followed by gemcitabine therapy. A pharmacokinetic evaluation of gemcitabine and its main metabolite, 20, 20 -difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), was conducted at the initial administra-tion of gemcitabine, which was given by intravenous infusion over 30 min at a dose of 800 – 1, 000 mg/m 2.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the occurrence of}} pancreatic, <b>biliary</b> <b>tract,</b> and gallbladder cancers within the Alaska Native (AN) population. Study design: Population-based analysis utilizing a tumor registry and comparative population data. Methods: Pancreaticobiliary cancers rates for AN people during 1973 &#x 2013; 2007 were determined from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) AN Tumor Registry. Cancer incidence rates were age-adjusted to the World Standard Million and compared over 2 time periods with US white and black rates. Results: During 1973 &#x 2013; 2007, 213 AN people developed pancreatic cancer, 73 gallbladder cancer and 61 <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer. Pancreatic cancer occurs at similar rates in AN men and women, but data for 1993 &#x 2013; 2007 indicate that the rates among AN men may be increasing.

40|$|The {{observation}} that drainage of the MPD in selected cases of severe chronic pancreatitis has a radical benefit on pain reduction supports {{the hypothesis that}} pain is mainly due to obstruction of the MPD. Further follow-up study is needed to assess whether endoscopic management can prevent progression {{of the disease and}} especially postpone the onset of diabetes and steatorrhea. The iterative character of the endoscopic management is at least an advantage when compared with surgery, which, in principle, might be considered definitive in only one operation. The present excellent results of non-surgical management of chronic pancreatitis suggest that these new procedures will find a prominent role similar to that already achieved <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> procedures.

40|$|Abstract Background Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are {{malignant}} tumors {{arising from}} the intrahepatic <b>biliary</b> <b>tract.</b> The pathogenesis of these tumors remains unknown. Although there is a marked global variation in prevalence, some recent studies have suggested an increase in mortality from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in several regions of low endemicity. As the study of mortality trends may yield clues to possible etiological factors, we analyzed worldwide time trends in mortality from <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> malignancies. Methods Annual age-standardized rates for individual countries were compiled <b>for</b> deaths from <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> malignancies using the WHO database. These data were used to analyze gender and site-specific trends in mortality rates. Results An increasing trend for mortality from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was noted in most countries. The average estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in mortality rates for males was 6. 9 ± 1. 5, and for females was 5. 1 ± 1. 0. Increased mortality rates were observed in all geographic regions. Within Europe, increases were higher in Western Europe than in Central or Northern Europe. In contrast, mortality rates <b>for</b> extrahepatic <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> malignancies showed a decreasing trend in most countries, with an overall average EAPC of - 0. 3 ± 0. 4 for males, but - 1. 3 ± 0. 4 for females.

In our patient, gemcitabine plus S- 1 regimen was ineffective, but the gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen temporarily {{reduced the}} size of liver metastases. Gemcitabine was reported to achieve complete remission of undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells in the periampullary region [15]. But the effect of chemotherapy on undifferentiated carcinoma of the <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> system is unclear {{because of the small}} number of cases. The transient effect observed in the present patient is a matter to be noted and should be taken into account in the future.|$|R
40|$|How {{should a}} {{positive}} urine urobilinogen dipstick test be evaluated? Evidence-Based Answer: A positive urine urobilinogen test (greater-than {{or equal to}} 3 mg/dL) does not have adequate sensitivity or specificity {{to function as a}} reasonable screening test <b>for</b> liver or <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> disease (SOR: C, based on 3 prospective, observational cohort studies) ...|$|R
30|$|PL was {{purchased}} from LKT Labs. Co., (Minnesota, USA). Poly(L-lactide) (PLA, PLA- 0005, M.W.[*]=[*] 5000 [*]g/mol from the manufacturer’s data) {{was purchased}} from Wako Pure Chem. Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Methoxy poly(ethylene lycol)-succinimidylglutarate (MePEG-NHS, M.W.[*]=[*] 5000 [*]g/mol) was purchased from Sunbio Co. Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). Silicon-membrane covered stent <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> {{was obtained from}} M.I. Tech. (Pyeongtaek, Korea). Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL, number-average M.W.[*]=[*] 80, 000 [*]g/mol), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC), tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl)- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and selenocystamine dihydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., (St. Louis, MO, USA). The dialysis membrane or dialysis device (M.W. cutoff size (MWCO) 1000 [*]g/mol and 8000 [*]g/mol) was purchased from Spectrum/Por Lab., Inc. (CA, USA). All organic solvents and other chemicals were used as extra-pure grade. Cell culture supplies such as RPMI 1640 media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Tech. Inc. (Grand Island, NY, USA). All reagent and organic solvents used were HPLC-grade.|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{resection}} is {{the only}} curative treatment <b>for</b> <b>biliary</b> <b>tract</b> cancer (BTC), including cholangiocarcinoma [1] and gallbladder carcinoma [2]. The 5 -year survival rate is unsatisfactory even after curative resection: 33.1  % in cholangiocarcinoma and 41.6  % in gallbladder carcinoma [3]. The recurrence rate remains high and is reported to range from 46 to 71  % [4 – 6]. Most patients with recurrence undergo systemic chemotherapy [7]. However, the survival benefit is insufficient; Valle et al [7] reported in their trial that the median overall survival was only 11.7  months and no patients survived for more than 3  years. Recently, the effectiveness of surgical treatment for recurrence of BTC has been reported [4, 8, 9]. To our knowledge, few cases of recurrent BTC treated by hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (HPD) have been reported. Here, we report the favorable survival outcome of a patient who underwent an HPD combined with hepatic artery and portal vein (PV) resections for cholangiocarcinoma recurrence arising after a surgery for a type IV-A congenital choledochal cyst.|$|R
