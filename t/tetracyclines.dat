Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, <b>tetracyclines,</b> avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and <b>tetracyclines</b> such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E

5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with <b>tetracyclines</b> or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of <b>tetracyclines</b> and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. <b>Tetracyclines</b> (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E

40|$|A <b>tetracycline</b> {{resistance}} {{gene that}} was found originally on the Bacteroides plasmid pBF 4 confers resistance on Escherichia coli but only when cells are growing aerobically. When E. coli EM 24 carrying this aerobic <b>tetracycline</b> resistance (*Tcr) gene is grown in medium containing <b>tetracycline,</b> the resulting spent medium is no longer toxic to tetracycline-sensitive (Tcs) E. coli EM 24 (B. S. Speer and A. A. Salyers, J. Bacteriol. 170 : 1423 - 1429, 1988). To determine whether the *Tcr gene product modified <b>tetracycline,</b> we characterized the material resulting from incubation of E. coli (*Tcr) with <b>tetracycline.</b> When [7 - 3 H(N) ]tetracycline was added to cultures of E. coli (*Tcr), at least 90 % of the label was recovered in the extracellular fluid. Therefore, <b>tetracycline</b> was not being sequestered by the cells. The labeled material behaved similarly to <b>tetracycline</b> with respect to solubility in various organic solvents. However, the UV-visible light spectrum had a single peak at 258 nm, whereas the <b>tetracycline</b> spectrum had a peak at 364 nm. The labeled material also had a faster migration rate than did <b>tetracycline</b> on thin-layer plates in a solvent system of butanol-methanol- 10 % citric acid (4 : 1 : 2, vol/vol/vol) and was separable from <b>tetracycline</b> by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, using an acetronitrile- 0. 1 % trifluoroacetic acid solvent system.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{containing}} the cryptic <b>tetracycline</b> resistance determinant (class F) from the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn 4400 on plasmid pGAT 400 expressed a detoxification of <b>tetracycline</b> {{as well as}} an active efflux of <b>tetracycline.</b> This finding concurs with the report of detoxification for a related <b>tetracycline</b> resistance determinant from B. fragilis on Tn 4351 (B.

Inactivation of <b>tetracycline</b> occurred at an initial rate of congruent to 0. 7 micrograms of <b>tetracycline</b> per h per 10 (8) cells, as determined by biologic assay and chromatographic analysis. The detoxification is a chemical degradation which can occur in the absence of energy-dependent efflux. The products of this degradation were not substrates for active transport into susceptible cells or out of pGAT 400 -containing E. coli.

40|$|Accumulation of <b>tetracycline</b> in Escherichia coli was {{studied to}} {{determine}} its permeation pathway {{and to provide a}} basis for understanding efflux-mediated resistance. Passage of <b>tetracycline</b> across the outer membrane appeared to occur preferentially via the porin OmpF, with <b>tetracycline</b> in its magnesium-bound form. Rapid efflux of magnesium-chelated <b>tetracycline</b> from the periplasm was observed. In E. coli cells that do not contain exogenous <b>tetracycline</b> resistance genes, the steady-state level of <b>tetracycline</b> accumulation was decreased when porins were absent or when the fraction of Mg(2 +) -chelated <b>tetracycline</b> was small. This is best explained by assuming the presence of a low-level endogenous active efflux system that bypasses the outer membrane barrier. When influx of <b>tetracycline</b> is slowed, this efflux is able to reduce the accumulation of <b>tetracycline</b> in the cytoplasm. In contrast, we found no evidence of a special outer membrane bypass mechanism for high-level efflux via the Tet protein, which is an inner membrane efflux pump coded for by exogenous tetA genes. Fractionation and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation experiments showed that the Tet protein is not localized to regions of inner and outer membrane adhesion. Furthermore, a high concentration of <b>tetracycline</b> was found in the compartment that rapidly equilibrated with the medium, most probably the periplasm, of Tet-containing E. coli cells, and the level of <b>tetracycline</b> accumulation in Tet-containing cells was not diminished by the mutational loss of the OmpF porin.

Oxytetracycline (Terramycin) was discovered shortly afterwards by AC Finlay et al.; it came from a similar soil bacterium named Streptomyces rimosus. Robert Burns Woodward determined the structure of oxytetracycline, enabling Lloyd H. Conover to successfully produce tetracycline itself as a synthetic product.
