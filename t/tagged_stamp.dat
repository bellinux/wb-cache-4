50|$|The first <b>tagged</b> <b>stamps</b> of Canada {{were issued}} in 1962 with {{vertical}} phosphorescent bands. In 1972, fluorescent general tagging was introduced, initially as vertical bars, now normally {{on all four}} sides of the stamp.|$|R
50|$|The former Republic of Rhodesia {{used two}} WW2 British-style {{compressed}} asbestos fiber tags, a No. 1 octagonal (green) tag and a No. 2 circular (red) <b>tag,</b> <b>stamped</b> with identical information. The red tag was supposedly fireproof {{and the green}} tag rotproof. The following information was stamped on the tags: Number, Name, Initials, & Religion; Blood Type was stamped on reverse. The air force and BSAP often stamped their service on the reverse side above the blood group.|$|R
50|$|According to the National Wildlife Federation, {{wildlife}} in the United States gets {{a majority of}} their funding through appropriations from the federal budget, annual federal and state grants, and financial efforts from {{programs such as the}} Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. Furthermore, a substantial amount of funding comes from the state through the sale of hunting/fishing licenses, game <b>tags,</b> <b>stamps,</b> and excise taxes from the purchase of hunting equipment and ammunition, which collects around $200 million annually.|$|R
50|$|Deutsche Bundespost started issuing stamps on {{fluorescent}} Lumogen {{paper in}} 1960 {{in connection with}} trials for automated mail processing in the Darmstadt area. Fluorescent paper was generally used for stamps of Deutsche Bundespost and Deutsche Bundespost Berlin from 1961 on. Deutsche Post AG continues to use this technology. Deutsche Post of the GDR did not use luminescent <b>tagging</b> on <b>stamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nitish also {{introduced}} monitoring of IAY completions through satellite based geo <b>tagged</b> and time <b>stamped</b> photography. This was an unheard of practice in Bihar and unparalleled in IAY monitoring in the nation.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{absorption}} of light, fluorescent materials emit light upon of a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed radiation, but cease {{to do so}} once immediately, when the illumination is stopped. The <b>tagging</b> of <b>stamps</b> uses substances that absorb ultraviolet light of wavelengths between 300 nm and 450 nm ("Black light", UVA, long-wave UV) and emit light in the visible spectrum. Under UV illumination they usually glow a greenish or yellowish colour.|$|R
30|$|A second manual {{annotation}} pass provided literal transcriptions and acoustic {{events of}} segments that feature planned and spontaneous speech, but no long term background noises. The non-speech acoustic events were furthermore <b>tagged</b> with time <b>stamps</b> indicating their beginning and end.|$|R
5000|$|The Nationale Volksarmee used a tag nearly {{identical}} to that used by both the Wehrmacht and the West German Bundeswehr. The oval aluminum <b>tag</b> was <b>stamped</b> [...] "DDR" [...] (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) above the personal ID number; this information was repeated on the bottom half, which {{was intended to be}} broken off in case of death. Oddly, the tag was not worn, but required to be kept in a plastic sleeve {{in the back of the}} WDA identity booklet.|$|R
5000|$|Phosphorescent {{materials}} {{release the}} absorbed energy only slowly, {{so that they}} exhibit an [...] "afterglow". Materials for <b>stamp</b> <b>tagging</b> absorb ultraviolet light of wavelengths between 180 nm and 300 nm (UVC, short-wave UV) and emit light of a greenish or reddish colour depending on the substances used.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tagging</b> of postage <b>stamps</b> {{means that}} the stamps are printed on {{luminescent}} paper or with luminescent ink to facilitate automated mail processing. Both fluorescence and phosphorescence are used. The same stamp may have been printed with and without these luminescent features, the two varieties {{are referred to as}} tagged and untagged, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The hunter {{occupies}} {{a special place}} in the system of human-animal interactions. When entering the natural world of wildlife each hunter learns to navigate this world {{in his or her own}} way. Hunters aid wildlife management agencies tangibly by maintaining a balance in wildlife populations and economically through hunting license fees, <b>tags,</b> <b>stamps,</b> and taxes from the sales of hunting weapons and equipment. Hunting participation in the United States has been declining over the past twenty years. However, the number of female hunters increased 25 % between 2006 and 2011. The increasing concern for animal (wild and domesticate) welfare and the decreasing connectedness to nature makes the exploration of women hunters a critical component to creating a comprehensive understanding of human-animal relationships. This study explores how women hunters in Eastern North Carolina are engaging in and experiencing hunting and uncovering their thoughts and beliefs about hunting, wildlife, and the changing place of women in hunting. The sample includes 25 women hunters, living in Eastern North Carolina. The data are collected using a four part interview instrument; a semi-structured interview, an instrument to gather demographic information, and two structured components. Using the grounded theory approach to text analysis and the software application RStudio to conduct statistical analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, three main findings emerge; the culture of hunting that enables women’s participation, women hunters’ relationships with wildlife, and the changing perspectives about women who hunt. These findings can assist wildlife management agencies to improve their understanding of women hunters in hopes of further increasing female hunting participation, educating the general public about hunters and hunting in the US, and informing policy and planning for environmental and wildlife conservation...|$|R
50|$|Metal tags {{usually have}} their {{information}} embossed or engraved onto, or stamped into, their surface(s). The characters created by embossing or engraving {{are made by}} removing some of the tag's surface and are not typically as deep as stamped characters, which are made by <b>stamping</b> the <b>tag</b> with a metal die. <b>Stamped</b> <b>tags</b> are therefore often more durable than engraved tags, though some drag-engraving and laser engraving methods can be as deep, or deeper, than the stamped versions.|$|R
5000|$|A travel bug is an item {{which is}} {{trackable}} which looks {{similar to a}} dog tag. The <b>tag</b> is <b>stamped</b> with a tracking number and the Geocaching.com website address. A travel bug can be attached to another item by use of the chain on the travel bug if required, examples of such items include teddy bears, toy cars, or golf balls. These attached items are called [...] "hitchhikers". [...] During the registration of the bug on the website, the owner may create an assign a name and also create a purpose or mission for the bug. These missions can be as simply as [...] "to travel as far as possible" [...] or to travel to a specific cache, location or {{a certain type of}} location. On Geocaching.com, each travel bug has an individual page which tracks its movement and calculates the distance travelled.|$|R
50|$|Regulations {{requiring}} {{hand baggage}} <b>tags</b> to be <b>stamped</b> by security personnel at all airports was introduced from 1992. Between 15-21 December 2016, the CISF conducted a week-long trial at 6 airports during which all domestic passengers would be exempted from the stamping requirement. Civil aviation security regulator Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) announced on 23 February 2017, that <b>stamping</b> baggage <b>tags</b> {{was no longer}} required at 7 airports - Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Cochin. The Ministry of Civil Aviation intends to gradually eliminate the requirement from all airports.|$|R
5000|$|Luminescent tagging {{has been}} added to postage stamps of the United Kingdom since the Wilding issues of 1959 in the shape of {{vertical}} bands. Stamps of the current Machin series have been printed with one or two such [...] "phosphor bands",. those for second-class mail bear only one such band, those for first-class mail bear two. The positions of the bands may vary, stamps from booklets may have shortened, notched, or inset bands that do not extend onto neighbouring gutters to avoid the use of the latter instead of stamps for franking. Due to the presence of optical brighteners in many printing papers, phosphorescent materials were chosen for <b>stamp</b> <b>tagging</b> in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Punched tag systems {{employ a}} set of pegs with each peg holding tags for one unit in the {{dispatch}} fleet. Each vehicle working the current shift has a peg with a tag describing the unit's current status. A time clock, {{similar to the one}} that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp times on each tag. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier may be posted above the peg. The unit's start time is stamped and their status is written on the tag. Each time the resource's status changes, a new tag is written and the <b>tag</b> is time <b>stamped</b> in order to log the time the unit's status changed. The peg collects a stack of tags through the work shift.|$|R

40|$|In Digital Methods, Richard Rogers {{proposes a}} methodological outlook {{for social and}} {{cultural}} scholarly research on the Web that seeks to move Internet research beyond the study of online culture. It is not a toolkit for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study social media to learn something about society rather than about social media use? How can hyperlinks reveal not just {{the value of a}} Web site but the politics of association? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native techniques for research into cultural change and societal conditions. We can learn to reapply such "methods of the medium" as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn how they handle hits, likes, <b>tags,</b> date <b>stamps,</b> and other Web-native objects. By "thinking along" with devices and the objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new methodological outlook to examine the findings of inquiries into 9 / 11 search results, the recognition of climate change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, the events surrounding the Srebrenica massacre according to Dutch, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian Wikipedias, presidential candidates' social media "friends," and the censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers introduces a new vision and method for Internet research {{and at the same time}} applies them to the Web's objects of study, from tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media) ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{tow truck}} example, the peg might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, [...] "Downtown 6" [...] {{and may be}} labeled with the vehicle number or data about the {{capabilities}} of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the tow car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit [...] "available" [...] and time <b>stamp</b> a <b>tag,</b> then hang it on that unit's peg. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on another tag and the <b>tag</b> might be <b>stamped</b> at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The tag would then be hung on that unit's peg. The stack of tags allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet.|$|R
40|$|Digital Immortality or Not?The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore how we might be {{stewards}} for our post-life digital self after physical death, {{and to provide a}} new interaction experience {{in the form of a}} tangible, digital, or service design solution. Prior to the project kick-off secondary research, including academic research papers, analogous services, and existing projects, was distilled to form topical questions. These questions were then presented in many casual topical conversations and revealed that although post-life digital asset management awareness is increasing, little consideration exists on how to reflect legacies into the future long after death. A second stage of primary research included multiple on-site investigations, paired with in-person interviews and a quantitative online survey. Insights and understandings then lead to initial concepts that were tested to address distinctive qualities between tangible and digital design solutions. The main findings included that although people want to be remembered long after they die, current methods of tangible and digital content management can not sufficiently support the reflection of legacies long into the future. In conclusion, this thesis argues that to become part of an everlasting legacy, the interaction experience can leverage commonalities and shared moments from life events captured in digital media. These points of connections rely on associated metadata (i. e. keyword <b>tags,</b> date <b>stamps,</b> geolocation) to align relevant moments that transcend time and generations. The solution proposed here harnesses the benefits that both digital and tangible media afford and are presented as a tablet interface with an associated tangible token used as a connection key...|$|R
40|$|I am steadfast {{against any}} change {{at this time}} for {{recreational}} fisherman. First and foremost {{we need to know}} how many anglers targeting red snapper there really are. In my opinion there is dire need for a red snapper <b>tag</b> or <b>stamp</b> to be issued with a state fishing license or available at sporting goods, bait camps, marinas, or some readily available source and most anglers {{would be willing to pay}} a reasonable fee for it. Then and only then can we get a real number of anglers targeting red snapper. With that you would have the information to gather your catch information as you could get addresses, phone numbers, email or other contact for the real snapper anglers. From this you could do creel surveys at the marinas, bait camps, boat ramps, or do phone email surveys. This is how we get real numbers and not some imaginary ghost numbers that are far from the facts. This would be real factual information to have a much better assessment of the fishery. This could also be the building blocks for other species as well. I myself know many people that buy a Texas fishing license and a state saltwater stamp that have never been red snapper fishing and never will fish for red snapper. We can’t just throw some unknown number out there and assume that a large percentage of the license bearers are snapper fishing or get anywhere of the real number of red snapper angler. There are bay fishermen that never go offshore. There are offshore fishermen that never target red snapper. To just give a natural resource as important as our red snapper t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we provide}} {{complete}} end-to-end delay analyses including the relay nodes for instant messages. Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) {{is used to}} provide congestion control for large messages in the Instant Messaging (IM) service. Large messages are broken into several chunks. These chunks may traverse through a maximum number of two relay nodes before reaching destination according to the IETF specification of the MSRP relay extensions. We discuss the current solutions of sending large instant messages and introduce a proposal to reduce message flows in the IM service. We consider virtual traffic parameter i. e., the relay nodes are stateless non-blocking for scalability purpose. This type of relay node is also assumed to have input rate at constant bit rate. We provide a new scheduling policy that schedules chunks according to their previous node’s delivery time <b>stamp</b> <b>tags.</b> Validation and analysis is shown for such scheduling policy. The performance analysis with the model introduced in this paper is simple and straight forward, which lead to reduced message flows in the IM service.
