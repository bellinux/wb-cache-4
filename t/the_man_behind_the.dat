The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted {{a lot of attention}} of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E

Suslov was, {{alongside}} Premier Alexei Kosygin and First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, one of the most influential Soviet politicians of the 1960s following the ouster of Khrushchev. Having led the opposition against Khrushchev for years, Suslov had acquired and wielded great power within the Central Committee when Brezhnev rose to power. However, Suslov was never interested in becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, and was content to remain <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes. During most of his term, Suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in the Secretariat and the Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Andrei Kirilenko and Fyodor Kulakov.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} Alfano reached {{as far as}} politics.

The night before the election dissident voters were intimidated, assaulted, beaten, and sustained knife injuries by ruffians hired and encouraged by both the Camorra and the police, since the authorities equally disapproved of a socialist candidate. Alfano, Rapi and Vitozzi were seen and photographed while actively directing the vote in favour of Count Ravaschieri in the Camorra controlled district of Vicaria in which Ciccotti surprisingly had won in 1900. Ravaschieri won the 1904 election.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E
