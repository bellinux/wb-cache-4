30|$|Several {{limitations}} {{in this study}} need to be acknowledged. Firstly the present study {{did not include a}} separate non-exercise control group. Additionally, the intra-class correlation analysis between trials at baseline showed moderate levels of reliability compared to previous research showing moderate to excellent reliability for PPT (Walton et al. 2011). This previous research used three repeated assessments of PPT at each site under resting conditions whereas the present study included a single assessment at bilateral muscle sites. However, due to differences between trials we analysed data separately for each exercise intensity. The data extracted for the present results were part of a larger data set involving noxious stimuli, however, the counterbalanced testing would have offset any cross-over effects. It {{should be noted that the}} transient pain inhibition limits the capacity to perform several repeated pain <b>threshold</b> <b>assessments</b> following exercise. Moreover, the participant sample may not generalise to older participants, females, and chronic disease patients.|$|R

This procedure was introduced in English primary and secondary schools in summer 2000. Although the recruitment and retention of teachers had become a growing concern for the government by that time, it would have been politically difficult to award teachers across the profession a pay increase without attaching any strings whatsoever. The <b>Threshold</b> <b>Assessment</b> procedure requires teachers to demonstrate that they have met a number of 'standards' in order to 'cross the threshold' and to receive a pay award (when first introduced, in 2000, this was 2, 000). This then allows them access to an upper pay scale, although progression up this is linked to their performance via the Performance Management procedure which was also introduced into schools at that time. The Teachers' Incentive Pay Project, currently in progress at the University of Exeter, studied the implementation of {{the first round of the}} <b>Threshold</b> <b>Assessment</b> procedure. It examined the way in which the procedure was conducted across England by collecting data from head teachers, teachers and threshold assessors. Ninety seven per cent of teachers applying to cross the threshold in the first round in summer 2000 were successful. This paper focuses on the experiences of teachers who were unsuccessful in their bid to cross the threshold, having been deemed to have 'not yet met' the required standards (referred to in this paper as NYM or 'unsuccessful' teachers). A number of issues emerge including differences between schools in the way in which the procedure was approached and undertaken; relationship problems between head teachers and teachers; the support available to NYM teachers; the appropriateness of the current procedure for 'nonstandard' teachers such as advisory/learning support staff, supply teachers and part-timers; the procedure's impact on teacher performance.

40|$|Arterial {{restenosis}} after coronary stenting {{is caused}} by excessive tissue growth which is stimulated by arterial injury and alterations to the hemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS). Recent numerical studies have predicted only minor differences in the altered WSS between different stent designs using a commonly employed <b>threshold</b> <b>assessment</b> technique. While {{it is possible that}} there are only minor differences, {{it is more likely that}} this assessment technique is incapable of fully elucidating the alterations to the WSS created by stent implantation. This paper proposes a methodology that involves a more complete investigation into the stentinduced alterations of WSS by incorporating the full suite of WSS-based variables: WSS, WSS gradient (WSSG), WSS angle gradient (WSSAG) and oscillatory shear index (OSI). The four variables are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to assess the effect of the stent implantation. The methodology is applied to three stents with contrasting designs: the Palmaz Schatz (PS), Gianturco Roubin II (GR-II) and Bx-Velocity (Bx) stents. For WSS the methodology ranks the stents (best to worst) as follows: PS, GR-II, Bx (Cohen’s d : − 0. 01, − 0. 613), for WSSG: PS, Bx, GR-II (d : 0. 159, 0. 764), for WSSAG: PS GR-II Bx (d : 0. 213, 0. 082), and for OSI: PS, GR-II, Bx (d : 0. 315, 0. 380).

The objective of this systematic review {{was to examine the}} effect of mu-opioid-receptor (MOR) antagonists in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies using 'inhibitory' or 'sensitizing', physiological test paradigms in healthy human subjects. The databases PubMed and Embase were searched according to predefined criteria. Out of a total of 2, 142 records, 63 studies (1, 477 subjects [male/female ratio = 1. 5]) were considered relevant. Twenty-five studies utilized 'inhibitory' test paradigms (ITP) and 38 studies utilized 'sensitizing' test paradigms (STP). The ITP-studies were characterized as conditioning modulation models (22 studies) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation models (rTMS; 3 studies), and, the STP-studies as secondary hyperalgesia models (6 studies), 'pain' models (25 studies), summation models (2 studies), nociceptive reflex models (3 studies) and miscellaneous models (2 studies). A consistent reversal of analgesia by a MOR-antagonist was demonstrated in 10 of the 25 ITP-studies, including stress-induced analgesia and rTMS. In the remaining 14 conditioning modulation studies either absence of effects or ambiguous effects by MOR-antagonists, were observed.

The threshold works with both the Iterative and Non{Iterative Methods that are used in the aerospace testing community to analyze and process balance data.

Head teachers did not find it difficult to assess the five standards that teachers had to meet in order to receive their 2, 000 additional performance payment, but they were very critical of the training they received, the amount of time they had to spend, and the changing ground rules. The success rate was 86 % of all teachers eligible, but 97 % of those who actually applied were awarded the additional payment. Most heads dealt with the applications entirely on their own, though one in six, mainly in the secondary sector, shared the task with senior colleagues. Unsuccessful candidates were few in number, but most were deemed to be failing on more than one aspect of their teaching. While those who were successful in crossing the threshold were pleased and relieved, unsuccessful applicants were said to be bitter, threatening action, in several cases leaving the school.

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Assessment</b> and {{intervention}} <b>thresholds</b> are developed and proposed in men aged over 50 years and postmenopausal {{women for the}} UK based on fracture probability from the WHO fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). INTRODUCTION: The FRAX tool has recently become available to compute the 10 -year probability of fractures in {{men and women from}} clinical risk factors (CRFs) with or without the measurement of femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD). The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a case-finding strategy for men and women from the UK at high risk of osteoporotic fracture by delineating the fracture probabilities at which BMD testing or intervention should be recommended. METHODS: Fracture probabilities were computed using the FRAX tool calibrated to the epidemiology of fracture and death in the UK. The relationship between cost effectiveness and fracture probability used the source data from a prior publication that examined the cost effectiveness of generic alendronate in the UK. An intervention threshold was set by age in men and women, based on the fracture probability equivalent to that of women with a history of a prior osteoporosis related fracture. In addition, <b>assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the use of BMD testing were explored. <b>Assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the measurement of BMD followed current practice guidelines where individuals were considered to be eligible for assessment in the presence of one or more CRF. An upper <b>assessment</b> <b>threshold</b> (i. e. a fracture probability above which patients could be treated without recourse to BMD) was based on optimisation of the positive predictive value of the assessment tool. The consequences of <b>assessment</b> {{and intervention}} <b>thresholds</b> on the requirement for BMD test and interventions were assessed using the distribution of clinical risk factors and femoral neck BMD for women in the source cohorts used for the development of the FRAX models RESULTS: Treatment was cost effective at all ages when the 10 -year probability of a major fracture exceeded 7 %. The intervention threshold at the age of 50 years corresponded to a 10 -year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture of 7. 5 %. This rose progressively with age to 30 % at the age of 80 years, so that intervention was cost effective at all ages. <b>Assessment</b> <b>thresholds</b> for testing with BMD (6 - 9 % at the age of 50 years) also rose with age (18 - 36 % at the age of 80 years). The use of these thresholds in a case-finding strategy would identify 6 - 20 % of women as eligible for BMD testing and 23 - 46 % as eligible for treatment, depending on age. The same threshold can be used in men. CONCLUSION: The study provides a method of developing management algorithms for osteoporosis from the estimation of fracture probabilities, rather than those based on BMD alone or BMD with single or multiple CRF...|$|R
40|$|On 4 October 2012, {{the then}} Director General {{designate}} of the Health Service Executive (HSE), Mr Tony O’Brien, {{requested that the}} Health Information and Quality Authority (the Authority) undertake a series of health technology assessments (HTAs) of scheduled surgical procedures. This was {{in the context of}} evaluating the potential impact of introducing clinical referral or treatment thresholds for selected high volume procedures within the publicly-funded healthcare system and to advise on possible thresholds for each of the procedures assessed. In April 2013, following a second request, the Terms of Reference were broadened to encompass a wider range of scheduled procedures currently undertaken in Ireland to which it would be appropriate to examine clinical referral and treatment <b>thresholds.</b> The <b>assessments</b> are being conducted on a phased basis. Phase I comprised analysis of clinical referral or treatment thresholds for otolaryngology, ophthalmology and vascular scheduled surgical procedures, the findings of which which were published in April 2013...|$|R
