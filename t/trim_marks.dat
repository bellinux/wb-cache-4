5000|$|The Mark V action {{remained}} relatively unchanged {{during the first}} five years of production. Shortly after, manufacturing moved from PFI in the U.S. to J. P. Sauer in Germany. In addition, the safety was redesigned and moved from the receiver to the bolt, which was changed from a smooth to a fluted surface. The first major change came in 1963 when Weatherby designed a shorter and more <b>trim</b> <b>Mark</b> V action for their 224 Weatherby Magnum varmint round, new for 1964. The bolt in this smaller Mark V action only had six locking lugs, versus the nine found on its bigger brother. Rifles chambered for the new 224 Wby Magnum were dubbed [...] "Varmintmaster." [...] The Varmintmaster was later offered in 22-250 Remington, making this the first non-Weatherby cartridge offered in the Mark V. In 1967, the 9-lug Mark V action was offered for the first time in 30-06. These two cartridges, the 30-06 and 22-250, remained the only two non-Weatherby chamberings offered in production Mark V rifles until the mid-1990s. (Though Weatherby would build a custom Mark V to a customer's specifications in virtually any caliber.) Today, all non-Weatherby standard calibers (not magnum cartridges) are only offered in 6-lug versions of the action. This makes 9-lug, 30-06 Mark Vs (whether made in Germany or Japan) somewhat of a rarity.|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} Nd:YAG laser cutting {{nonmetallic}} materials, {{which is one}} of the most important and popular industrial applications of laser. The main theme is to evaluate the effects of Nd:YAG laser beam power besides work piece scanning speed. For approximate cutting depth, a theoretical study is conducted in terms of material property and cutting speed. Results show a nonlinear relation between the cutting depth and input energy. There is no significant effect of speed on cutting depth with the speed being larger than 30 mm/s. An extra energy is utilized in the deep cutting. It is inferred that as the laser power increases, cutting depth increases. The experimental outcomes are in good agreement with theoretical results. This analysis will provide a guideline for laser-based industry to select a suitable laser for cutting, scribing, <b>trimming,</b> engraving, and <b>marking</b> nonmetallic materials...|$|R

Short pulsed lasers that can achieve wide range of wavelengths in the form of harmonics of infrared laser beam at 1064 nm wavelength have been a very effective micro-machining tool used for hole drilling, cutting, scribing, <b>trimming</b> and <b>marking.</b> A review of laser processing of materials is given in this paper. Direct laser ablation can be performed by controlling laser beam properties such as laser energy, intensity, pulse duration and wavelength in micro-machining 3 -D geometric features. However, this method requires additional capabilities for a typical laser beam generating and delivery system. When the laser beam properties cannot be altered, Hole Area Modulation (HAM) method becomes alternative solution by controlling the density of the holes and the step size in a mask to improve the accuracy of the 3 -D geometric feature. In this paper, we perform modeling, planning and simulation of laser micromachining with hole area modulation method to produce spherical and elliptical objects 3 -D geometrical features that are typical for aspheric and or refractive micro-lenses.

40|$|TRIM 32 is {{a member}} of the TRIpartite Motif family characterised by the {{presence}} of an N-terminal three-domain-module that includes a RING domain, which confers E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity, one or two B-box domains and a Coiled-Coil region that mediates oligomerisation. Several TRIM 32 substrates were identified including muscular proteins and proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cell motility. As ubiquitination is a versatile post-translational modification that can affect target turnover, sub-cellular localisation or activity, it is likely that diverse substrates may be differentially affected by TRIM 32 -mediated ubiquitination, reflecting its multi-faceted roles in muscle physiology, cancer and immunity. With particular relevance for muscle physiology, mutations in TRIM 32 are associated with autosomal recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2 H, a muscle-wasting disease with variable clinical spectrum ranging from almost asymptomatic to wheelchair-bound patients. In this review, we will focus on the ability of <b>TRIM</b> 32 to <b>mark</b> specific substrates for proteasomal degradation discussing how the TRIM 32 -proteasome axis may (i) be important for muscle homeostasis and for the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy; and (ii) define either an oncogenic or tumour suppressive role for TRIM 32 in the context of different types of cancer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During a viral infection, the {{intracellular}} RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) sense viral RNA and signal {{through the}} mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor MAVS (also known as IPS- 1, Cardif and VISA) whose activation triggers a rapid production of type I interferons (IFN) and of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the transcription factors IRF 3 /IRF 7 and NF-κB, respectively. While MAVS {{is essential for}} this signaling and known to operate through the scaffold protein NEMO and the protein kinase TBK 1 that phosphorylates IRF 3, its mechanism of action and regulation remain unclear. Results We report here that RLR activation triggers MAVS ubiquitination on lysine 7 and 10 by the E 3 ubiquitin ligase <b>TRIM</b> 25 and <b>marks</b> it for proteasomal degradation concomitantly with downstream signaling. Inhibition of this MAVS degradation with a proteasome inhibitor does not affect NF-κB signaling but it hampers IRF 3 activation, and NEMO and TBK 1, two essential mediators in type I IFN production, are retained at the mitochondria. Conclusions These results suggest that MAVS functions as a recruitment platform that assembles a signaling complex involving NEMO and TBK 1, and that the proteasome-mediated MAVS degradation is required to release the signaling complex into the cytosol, allowing IRF 3 phosphorylation by TBK 1. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{world has}} seen an unrivaled spread of {{semiconductor}} technology into virtually {{any part of}} society. The main enablers of this semiconductor rush are the decreasing feature size and the constantly decreasing costs of semiconductors. The decreasing costs of semiconductors in general are caused by the smaller feature size, the higher yield and larger production volumes. This has made products containing semiconductors cheaper in production thus reaching a larger market. The smaller feature size enables more computing power in the same volume creating new markets and growing application areas. The increasing number of appliances using semiconductor components is also driving the fast growth of the market. The trend of miniaturization of electronic components also demands the miniaturization and integration of non-electrical functions to allow for large decreases in size, weight and possibly cost. Soon after the first semiconductors were developed the first Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were also created. In the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s experiments with MEMS were done in lab environments. MEMS technology {{can be used to}} miniaturize non-electrical components thus enabling further system shrinkage and increased function density. The technologies, experiments and numerical simulations in this thesis provide MEMS designers with a design guideline in the creation process of new Wafer Level Thin Film Package (WLTFP) products as well as an overview of the most likely failure modes and high risk processes in the assembly. WLTFP’s are a miniature batch-process and wafer scale encapsulation method for MEMS that need space to move or hold a certain amount of gas. In the first chapters an overview of the most important processing steps in the production of WLTFP’s and the subsequent assembly steps needed to form a plastic encapsulated package is presented. Most common assembly steps included: wafer thinning, chip singulation, die-attach, wire bonding, overmoulding and saw, <b>trim,</b> <b>mark</b> & form. Wafer thinning is necessary to thin the chip to such a thickness that it will fit into the desired package. Chip singulation or dicing is commonly done by a diamond blade saw and makes separates the wafer into individual chips. Die-attach is the placement of the chip onto the carrier, for example a lead frame, by means of a glue. After dieattach connection the IO of the chip to the carrier can be done by wirebonding. After wire-bonding the package is overflowed by epoxy moulding compound to protect the chip inside from the environment. After finishing the package and marking it one has a complete product. In the creation process of a new MEMS product the design team is faced with a multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-timescale challenge. Nanometer dimensions can impact a millimeter size product and hours of operation can change a MEMS that performs microsecond measurements. To address this challenge an integrated design process is needed that covers the chip and wafer design as well as the package and all of the intermediate processes. An example of the influences from the package on the chip is calculated and shown in chapter three. In chapter four the properties of thin layers are investigated. In this investigation copper thin film are deposited on freestanding micro cantilevers. The samples are analyzed with white light interferometry to obtain the initial geometry properties and cantilever warpage. Using electrostatic pull-in to pull down the cantilever to the substrate the pull-in voltage is obtained. The stiffness of the two layer system can be derived from the pull-in voltage. Copper film thicknesses of 10 and 50 nanometer are measured and a size-dependant stiffness is proven. During the assembly of a WLTFP several failure modes are found. In the wafer thinning process the application of wafer thinning tape to the active side of the wafer can easily break many WLTFP’s. This can happen during the application or for example the removal of the tape. The placement of the wafer on dicing foil is also a potential risk as it leaves the MEMS exposed to the water jet of the dicing machine. Wire-bonding can be hazardous to MEMS sensitive to resonance, this risk can relatively easy be mitigated by calculation of eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. The overmoulding process and the associated process pressure can be hazardous to for example membranes or large WLTFP’s due to the static pressure on the cavity. The numerical simulations developed in chapter five provide a toolbox to check for weak spots in the design and investigate changes by virtual prototyping instead of physical prototyping. The simulations also include wafer foil application and removal simulation. The use of cohesive zones allows for a detailed investigation of the loads on the WLTFP. In chapter six the interface properties of the wafer thinning foil are investigated by means of a peeling experiment combined with numerical simulations. The characterization method yields interface properties that serve as input for aforementioned numerical simulations. The Design of Experiments presented in chapter seven investigates the influence four major design choices on the likelihood of survival during assembly. The span of the WLTFP, the corner rounding radius, cap thickness and presence of a pillar are investigated. After all 18720 samples were evaluated a design guidelines was derived. The design guideline in combination with the numerical simulations provides the MEMS design community with tools during the chip-design stage. This aids to the integrated approach of designing new MEMS and reduces the time to market and number of design iterations needed. PMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
