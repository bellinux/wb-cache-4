50|$|Warm fronts occur where <b>the</b> warm <b>air</b> pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold <b>air</b> mass. <b>The</b> warm <b>air</b> overrides <b>the</b> cooler <b>air</b> and moves upward. Warm fronts {{are followed by}} extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after <b>the</b> warm <b>air</b> rises above <b>the</b> cooler <b>air</b> (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to <b>the</b> <b>air's</b> expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.|$|R
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the RAAF's prime {{transport}} aircraft was the twin-engined Douglas C-47 Dakota. In 1946, C-47 operations were concentrated under No.86 Wing and its three flying squadrons, Nos.36, 37, and 38, based initially at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales. Despite the robustness and versatility of the Dakota, by the early 1950s <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force {{was looking for a}} replacement with greater cargo capacity and longer range, to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces. In 1954, the RAAF embarked on a major re-equipment drive, following a shift in defence funding that favoured <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force. <b>The</b> <b>Air</b> Officer Commanding Home Command, Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch, led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft.|$|E
