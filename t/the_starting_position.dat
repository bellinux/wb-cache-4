5|$|Christopher Evenson Turner (born September 8, 1987) is an American {{football}} quarterback. He played {{quarterback for}} the Maryland Terrapins at the University of Maryland from 2007 to 2009.

5|$|After the {{graduation}} of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> At {{the conclusion of}} spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, codebooks {{were only}} used {{each day to}} set up the rotors, their ring {{settings}} and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> let's say WZA, and a random message key, perhaps SXT. He moved the rotors to <b>the</b> WZA <b>start</b> <b>position</b> and encoded <b>the</b> message key SXT. Assume the result was UHL. He then set up the message key, SXT, as <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>position</b> and encrypted <b>the</b> message. Next, he transmitted <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>position,</b> WZA, <b>the</b> encoded message key, UHL, and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>position</b> according to <b>the</b> first trigram, WZA, and decoded the second trigram, UHL, to obtain the SXT message setting. Next, he used this SXT message setting as <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>position</b> to decrypt <b>the</b> message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.|$|R
5|$|Surprisingly, Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, {{reinstating}} Luongo in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.|$|E

5|$|After a redshirt {{season in}} 2005, Turner saw no playing {{time as the}} third-string quarterback the {{following}} year. In 2007, he replaced the injured starter during the game against 10th-ranked Rutgers and led the Terrapins to an upset victory. After that, he remained as the team's leader {{for the remainder of}} the season, and against eighth-ranked Boston College, engineered another upset victory. Turner also helped Maryland secure an appearance in the Emerald Bowl. At the start of the 2008 season, he was relegated to backup status, but soon regained <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> That year, he led Maryland in wins over four of their five ranked opponents and to an appearance in the Humanitarian Bowl. He returned as the starter for the 2009 season, but suffered a knee injury and was replaced by Jamarr Robinson.|$|E

5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss wanted him to play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E
5|$|Reimer {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season as the}} starter going 4–0–1. He {{suffered}} an injury on October 22 {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. During the game Reimer was run into by Brian Gionta, he finished the first period, but did not return after the intermission. The team called the injury whiplash despite rumors that he was suffering from a concussion. Reimer missed 19 games with the injury, and struggled upon his return, yielding some starts to Gustavsson. After recording two back-to-back shutouts on February 1 and February 4, Reimer seemed to have solidified <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> once again.|$|E

5|$|The {{muscular system}} has been {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E
5|$|Injuries had {{devastated the}} Maryland roster the {{previous}} year, and while 2008 was more forgiving by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first real action in the bowl game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put {{out for the season}} by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as checkers (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position)</b> and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2010 Winter Olympics, {{to be held in}} Luongo's NHL {{hometown}} of Vancouver, Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> On December 31, 2009, Luongo was selected to Team Canada, along with Brodeur and Marc-André Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins as the three goaltenders. Luongo was given the start for the first game against Norway. He recorded his first Olympic shutout, making 15 saves in an 8–0 win to open the tournament. After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5–3 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game, Luongo replaced him as the starting goalie. He helped Canada to four consecutive single-elimination game wins against Germany, Russia, Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal. During the semifinal against Slovakia, Luongo made a game-saving stop against Canucks teammate Pavol Demitra with nine seconds to go in regulation. With Slovakia's goaltender pulled and down by a goal, the puck bounced to Demitra {{by the side of the}} net. Out of position, Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck, deflecting it away from the net and preserving the win. In the subsequent gold medal game, Luongo made 34 saves in Canada's overtime win against the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Orlando Magic {{started the}} 2007–08 season with new coach Stan Van Gundy, and Arroyo again {{was at the}} backup point guard position. On November 28, 2007, he had a career-high 14 assists {{in a game against}} the Seattle SuperSonics. On December 29, 2007, Arroyo was {{promoted}} to <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> after Nelson experienced an extended offensive slump. With Nelson in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> during this period the team was having an average of seventeen turnovers per game, and he was unable to score in double digits on 10 out of 17 games. This led to Van Gundy issuing several public notices concerning the team's performance eventually leading to changes in the starting formation. During Arroyo's first three games in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position</b> the number of turnovers produced by the team was lowered to eleven per game. Arroyo's points average was within double digits in all of these games and he recorded seventeen assists. Arroyo closed January in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>position,</b> the team finished the month winning five out of six games.|$|E
50|$|Juan Pablo Montoya won {{the race}} from <b>the</b> 2nd <b>starting</b> <b>position.</b> It was <b>the</b> first time a driver had won {{from the middle of}} the front row since Mario Andretti in 1969.
