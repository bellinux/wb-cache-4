40|$|The European Commission Regulations No 692 / 2008 and No 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework for type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6). One of the applicable tests is the low temperature emission test (Type VI), which is conducted at sub-ambient temperature conditions (- 7 °C). The low temperature emission test is currently required only for vehicles with positive ignition engines. However the <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> <b>test</b> to diesel vehicles is under consideration, {{mainly because of the}} introduction of the new technologies in diesel engines in order to comply with the Euro 5 / 6 emission standards, of which the efficiency in controlling emission may strongly depend on the ambient temperature. This is especially true for Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems and after-treatment systems for Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) that are deactivated or not operate in cold weather conditions, may result in elevated NOx emissions. The review should consider whether to extend the low temperature emission test to Euro 6 diesel vehicles and whether emission limit should be introduced in the future. This report provides a picture of the low temperature emission performances of late technology diesel vehicles The main results of the experimental activity carried out at JRC to investigate the behaviour at low temperature of Euro 5 / 6 diesel passenger cars are summarised and discussed.

40|$|The Commission Regulations (EC) No 692 / 2008 and 715 / 2007 set the {{regulatory}} framework for type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 / 6. In particular these regulations set the emission standards and the related implementing measures, divided into three different steps, that will enter into force between 2009 (Euro 5) and 2014 (Euro 6). However the above mentioned Regulations leave open some issues regarding the Euro 5 b and the Euro 6 emission standards to be addressed and defined before the entry into force of these pieces of legislation. As far as the low temperature emission test for gasoline vehicles is concerned the current emission limits, carried over from Euro 3 / 4, are no longer appropriate for vehicles meeting the Euro 5 / 6 emission standards. This report provides {{a picture of the}} low temperature emission performances (based on type approval data of <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> <b>test)</b> of the current generation of gasoline vehicles. It also summarizes the main results of the experimental activity carried out at JRC to investigate the behaviour at low temperature of Euro 5 passenger cars and provide useful data for the revision of the low temperature emission standards for gasoline vehicles.

40|$|SummaryThe chondron {{represents}} the chondrocyte and its pericellular microenvironment and {{plays an important}} role in the progression of osteoarthritis. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen is preferentially localized in the pericellular microenvironment of adult articular cartilage and increases during osteoarthritis. In this study, we characterized the pericellular sequestration of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in long-term chondrocyte-agarose cultures, and assessed the action of interleukin- 1 on <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen deposition and assembly. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis showed that cultured chondrocytes initiate <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen sequestration immediately upon plating and continue pericellular matrix sequestration in a time dependent manner. Confocal microscopy confirmed the cell surface localization and pericellular accumulation of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen, while image analysis identified a ‘cargo-net like’ organization of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen around each chondrocyte. Quantitative analysis revealed a primary phase of rapid cell division and low levels of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen sequestration, followed by a secondary phase of relative growth stability and high levels of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen deposition. Interleukin- 1 treated cultures showed increased sequestration and retention of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in an expanded microenvironment surrounding the chondrocytes. The data suggests a role for <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in the differentiation of the pericellular microenvironment in vitro. The increased <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen sequestration promoted by interleukin- 1 was consistent with previous studies on osteoarthritic cartilage, and implies a functional role for <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in the chondron remodeling associated with cartilage degradation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} study the expression of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in normal and osteoarthritic human knee cartilage. Methods: Seventy-two osteoarthritic cartilage/bone samples were obtained form 29 patients with primary OA undergoing surgery for a total knee replacement. Normal cartilage was collected from five human knees {{at the time of}} autopsy. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen protein was localized using a polyclonal anti human <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen antibody, the corresponding mRNA was detected with an 310 base antisense probe, specific for the α 2 (VI) collagen chain. Results: In normal cartilage, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen protein is concentrated pericellularly around the chondrocytes of all cartilage zones. In the middle and deep zones, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was also found in the interterritorial matrix. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen mRNA expression was detected in chondrocytes of all cartilage zones. In moderately affected osteoarthritic cartilage, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen expression was increased. An intensive immunohistological interterritorial staining for <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was observed in the middle and deep cartilage zones. Specific mRNA signals were also increased especially in the middle and deep cartilage zone. In the superficial zone and calcified cartilage of these samples, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen mRNA expression was restricted to focal areas. In severe osteoarthritic cartilage, an intensive staining for <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen mRNA was found in clusters of proliferating chondrocytes and in the deep cartilage zone. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was localized pericellularly and in the matrix of chondrocyte clusters. Furthermore, chondrocytes from the deep zone showed a territorial distribution of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen is expressed in a zone specific pattern. The observed increase of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen expression in osteoarthritis suggests a potential role in the disease process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> {{collagen}} is a {{major component}} of the pericellular matrix compartment in articular cartilage and shows severe alterations in osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration. In this study, we analysed the exact localization of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in its relationship to the chondrocyte and the (inter) territorial cartilage matrix. Additionally, we were interested in its ultrastructural appearance in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage. Design Distribution and molecular appearance was investigated by conventional immunostaining, by multilabeling confocal scanning microscopy, conventional transmission, and immunoelectron microscopy. Results Our analysis confirmed the pericellular concentration of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in normal and degenerated cartilage. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen formed an interface in between the cell surface and the type II collagen network. The <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and the type II collagen networks appeared to have a slight physical overlap in both normal and diseased cartilage. Additionally, some epitope staining was observed in the cell-associated interterritorial cartilage matrix, which did not appear to have an immediate relation to the type II collagen fibrillar network as evaluated by immunoelectron microscopy. In osteoarthritic cartilage, significant differences were found compared with normal articular cartilage: the overall dimension of the lacunar volume increased, and a significantly increased <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen epitope staining was observed in the interterritorial cartilage matrix. Also, the banded isoform of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was found around many chondrocytes. Conclusions Our study confirms the close association of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen with both, the chondrocyte cell surface and the territorial cartilage matrix. They show severe alterations in <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen distribution and appearance in osteoarthritic cartilage. Our immunohistochemical and ultrastructural data are compatible with two ways of degradation of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in osteoarthritic cartilage: (1) the pathologically increased physiological molecular degradation leading to the complete loss of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen filaments from the pericellular chondrocyte matrix and (2) the transformation of the fine filaments to the band-like form of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen. Both might implicate a significant loss of function of the pericellular microenvironment in osteoarthritic cartilage. Copyright 2002 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen have been investigated, using solid phase binding assays, with two {{components of the}} fibrillin-containing microfibrils, the elastin-binding protein, MAGP- 1 and its structural relative MAGP- 2. Both native and pepsin-treated forms of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen specifically bound to MAGP- 1 but not to MAGP- 2. Pepsin <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was shown to block the binding of MAGP- 1 to native <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen indicating that the major MAGP- 1 -binding site was in the triple-helical region of the molecule. MAGP- 1 was found not to bind to collagens I, III, and V. Affinity blotting of pepsin-treated <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen showed that MAGP- 1 binding was specific for the collagenous domain of the α 3 (VI) chain. Decorin and biglycan were found not to inhibit the interaction of pepsin-treated <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen with MAGP- 1, indicating that its binding site on the collagen is not close to that for the proteoglycans. Reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds in MAGP- 1 did not destroy its <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen-binding properties, indicating that the binding site {{was likely to be}} in the cysteine-free, N-terminal domain of MAGP- 1. Interestingly, the interaction of MAGP- 1 with <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was inhibited by tropoelastin, suggesting that the binding sites for tropoelastin and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen may be in the same domain of MAGP- 1. A peptide, corresponding to amino acids 29 – 38 of MAGP- 1, was found to inhibit the {{interactions of}} MAGP- 1 with <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and tropoelastin. The results suggest that the peptide may contain the binding sequences for both <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and tropoelastin, and thus that these two proteins may share the same binding site on MAGP- 1. The interactions of MAGP- 1 with <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and tropoelastin were both determined to be of moderately high affinity, withK d values of 5. 6 × 10 − 7 m and 2. 6 × 10 − 7 m, respectively. The findings indicate that MAGP- 1 may mediate a molecular interaction between <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen microfibrils and fibrillin-containing microfibrils, structures which are often found in close proximity to each other {{in a wide range of}} extracellular matrices.

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> {{collagen}} is a nonfibrillar collagen {{expressed in}} many connective tissues and implicated in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. We hypothesized that <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen regulates matrix assembly and cell function within the dermis of the skin. In {{the present study}} we examined the expression pattern of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in normal and wounded skin and investigated its specific function in new matrix deposition by human dermal fibroblasts. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was expressed throughout the dermis of intact human skin, at the expanding margins of human keloid samples, and in the granulation tissue of newly deposited ECM in a mouse model of wound healing. Generation of cell-derived matrices (CDMs) by human dermal fibroblasts with stable knockdown of COL 6 A 1 revealed that <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen-deficient matrices were significantly thinner and contained more aligned, thicker, and widely spaced fibers than CDMs produced by normal fibroblasts. In addition, there was significantly less total collagen and sulfated proteoglycans present in the <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen-depleted matrices. Normal fibroblasts cultured on de-cellularized CDMs lacking <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen displayed increased cell spreading, migration speed, and persistence. Taken together, these findings indicate that <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen is a key regulator of dermal matrix assembly, composition, and fibroblast behavior and may {{play an important role}} in wound healing and tissue regeneration...|$|R

Microfibrils were found to accumulate also in the sciatic nerves of diabetic BB rats; these microfibrillar deposits were shown to contain <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen by immunoelectron microscopy. Connective tissue cells cultured from rat sciatic nerves were exposed to high glucose concentrations. High glucose concentrations up-regulated the mRNA steady-state levels of alpha 1 (VI), alpha 2 (VI), and alpha 3 (<b>VI)</b> chains of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and caused accumulation of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen-containing fibrils in the cultures. Immunostaining and in situ hybridizations demonstrated that perineurial cells, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts expressed <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen at the mRNA and protein levels. The results suggest that the turnover and supramolecular assembly of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen are perturbed in diabetic nerves and that glucose per se increases the expression of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in vitro...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of oncogenic transformation on the expression of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in mesenchymal cells. Synthesis of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was almost completely inhibited in fibroblasts transformed by DNA or RNA tumour viruses or in cells derived from spontaneous mesenchymal tumours. Inhibition of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen synthesis appears, therefore, to be a common phenomenon of transformed mesenchymal cells. When introduced into normal cells by viral vectors, the 'nuclear' oncogene v-myc had an inhibitory effect {{similar to that of}} the 'cytoplasmic' oncogene v-src. Fibroblasts infected with a temperature-sensitive strain of Rous sarcoma virus (NY 68) produced <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen at the restrictive, but not at the permissive temperature. If such cells were shifted from the permissive to the restrictive temperature, synthesis of the individual subunits of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was co-ordinately induced.

30|$|The precise role of {{collagen}} VI has not {{yet been}} clearly defined. However, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen may serve as a filter or transducer for biochemical and/or biomechanical signals from the cartilage ECM. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen with lower molecular weight was evident in the pathological osteoarthritic dogs sacrificed 3, 5, and 7 months after surgery in comparison to the controls (McDevitt et al., 1988). It indicated that degradation products of larger <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> chains might be significant in the role this molecule plays in osteoarthritis. The <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen-deficient mice (Col 6 a 1) exhibited accelerated development of hip osteoarthritis, a delayed secondary ossification process, and a loss of the stiffness of the articular cartilage PCM (Alexopoulos et al., 2009). <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen demonstrated an important role in regulating the physiology of the synovial joint. In another context, the deficiency of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in mice resulted in decreased stiffness and increased chondrocyte swelling (Zelenski et al., 2015). These findings suggest that <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen has essential roles in transmitting mechanical and osmotic stresses from the ECM to the chondrocytes (Zelenski et al., 2015). The soluble <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was reported to promote chondrocyte proliferation under both healthy and osteoarthritic conditions. However, proliferation was not observed upon treatment of immobilized <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in chondrocytes, indicating that soluble <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen can be applied for autologous chondrocyte implantation to expand chondrocytes (Smeriglio et al., 2015). It was reported that a variant in the human Col 6 a 4 gene is associated with knee OA in Japanese and Chinese populations, but not found in a Korean population (Lee et al., 2013) nor in European OA individuals (Wagener et al., 2009). The contradictory findings could be explained by either the ethnic differences in OA susceptibility genes or the differences of criteria in OA selection.|$|R

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> {{collagen}} {{is present}} in most connective tissues, where it is considered to {{play a crucial role}} in the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and/or in the three-dimensional organization of the collagen meshwork. Although some information is available on its formation, the mechanisms involved in its degradation are not understood. Here, we present evidence for lysosomal digestion of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen by fibroblasts of periosteal explants. In the lysosomal apparatus of these cells, broad-banded filamentous aggregates characterized by 100 -nm periodicity were found, which proved to consist of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen as indicated by their stainability with anti-type VI collagen antibodies. By interfering with synthesis (ascorbate or alpha, alpha-dipyridyl), intracellular translocation of collagen-containing vesicles (colchicine) as well as phagocytosis (cytochalasin B), it was shown that the intracellular broad-banded <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen represented phagocytosed material. In the presence of acidotropic agents (NH 4 Cl and methylamine) the amount of intracellular <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen increased significantly (5 - to 10 -fold), suggesting that a rise of pH in the endosomal/lysosomal apparatus causes inhibition of its degradation. By using a variety of proteinase inhibitors, it was found that inhibition of collagenase (when used in combination with NH 4 Cl), or inhibition of cysteine proteinases (both with and without NH 4 Cl), resulted in an increased amount of intracellular <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen, whereas inhibition of serine proteinases significantly lowered the level of intracellular <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen. The data presented are the first to indicate a pathway by which <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen degradation may occur: fibroblasts phagocytose <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and subsequently digest this collagen in their lysosomal apparatus. Degradation depends on the activity of several enzymes, among them collagenase and serine proteinases, probably exerting their activity in the extracellular space just before the actual internalization. After uptake, digestion involves pH-sensitive lysosomal enzymes, including those belonging to the class of cysteine proteinase...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of capsular type polysaccharide and virulence {{characteristics of}} group B streptococci (GBS), <b>type</b> <b>VI,</b> were studied. By high-pressure anion-exchange chromatography and pulsed amperometric detection, {{as well as}} by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, both extracellular and cell-bound polysaccharides were found to contain glucose, galactose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid in the molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1, respectively. At variance with all other GBS serotypes described to date (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V), no N-acetylglucosamine was present, whatever the source of the material (secreted or cell bound; reference or clinical isolate). Sialic acid was probably involved in the immunodeterminant structure of this new serotype since cleavage of this sugar from the polysaccharide gave rise to an antigen which reacted very weakly with <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> antiserum and to a precipitation line in immunodiffusion with no identity with the native <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> polysaccharide.

This study was undertaken to identify whether NG 2 /HMPG had similar activities in human articular chondrocytes (HACs). Normal and OA adult HAC adhesion to fibronectin, type II or <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen {{was assessed using}} a methylene blue assay. The requirement for integrins, NG 2 /HMPG, and integrin-associated signalling molecules was investigated using anti-beta 1 integrin and anti-HMPG antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors of signalling molecules. The adhesion of normal and OA HACs to fibronectin, type II and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was beta 1 integrin-dependent. Normal HAC adhesion to <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was stimulated by anti-HMPG antibodies. This effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin. Anti-HMPG antibodies {{had no effect on}} OA chondrocyte adhesion to <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen, or on normal and OA cell adhesion to fibronectin and type II collagen. The results show that NG 2 /HMPG modulates integrin-mediated interactions of normal HACs with <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen. Loss of this activity may be of importance in the progression of osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|NG 2 is a membrane-associated chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycan}} with a {{core protein}} of 300 kD. Previously {{it was shown}} immunochemically that the core protein of NG 2 can bind <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen (Stallcup, W., Dahlin, K., and P. Healy. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111 : 3177 - 3188). We have extended our studies on the interaction of NG 2 and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen by transfecting cells with the full-length rat NG 2 cDNA. B 28 rat neural cells and U 251 MG human glioma cells used for transfection do not synthesize NG 2. Both cell lines secrete <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen into tissue culture medium but do not anchor it at the cell surface. Upon transfection of these cells with the NG 2 cDNA, NG 2 was correctly localized to the cell surface. Furthermore, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen could now be detected {{on the surface of}} NG 2 -positive cells in a pattern that coincided with that of NG 2. This ability of NG 2 to anchor <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen to the cell surface could be abolished by incubating the cells in the presence of anti-NG 2 monoclonal antibodies. These findings indicate that NG 2 functions as a cell surface receptor for <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen and {{may play a role in}} modulating the assembly of pericellular matrix...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} reactive {{with the}} tissue form of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen {{were used to}} isolate the <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen polypeptides from cultured fibroblasts and muscle cells. Two [35 S]methionine-labeled polypeptides of 260 and 140 kD were found intracellularly, in the medium, and in the extracellular matrix of metabolically labeled cells. These polypeptides were disulfide cross-linked into very large complexes. The 260 - and 140 - kD polypeptides were intimately associated {{and could not be}} separated from each other by reduction without denaturation. In the absence of ascorbic acid, both polypeptides accumulated inside the cell, and their amounts in the medium and in the matrix were decreased. These results suggest that both the 260 - and the 140 -kD polypeptides are integral parts of the <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen molecule. Examination of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen isolated from the intracellular pool by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing revealed structures corresponding to different stages of assembly of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen. Based on these images, a sequence for the intracellular assembly of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen could be discerned. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen monomers are approximately 125 nm long and are composed of two globules separated by a thin strand. The monomers assemble into dimers and tetramers by lateral association. Only tetramers were present in culture media, whereas both tetramers and multimers were found in extracellular matrix extracts. The multimers appeared to have assembled from tetramers by end-to-end association into filaments that had prominent knobs and a periodicity of approximately 110 nm. These results show that, unlike other collagens, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen is assembled into tetramers before it is secreted from the cells, and they also suggest an extracellular aggregation mechanism that appears to be unique to this collagen...|$|R
40|$|The binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to subendothelium {{constitutes}} an important initial {{step in the}} process of platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium following blood vessel injury. We previously demonstrated that vWF is present in human vascular subendothelium and recently found that a 150 kd vWF-binding protein, which we extracted from subendothelium, is <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen. Although we have established that vWF and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen bind in vitro, it is not known whether these two proteins are associated in the vascular subendothelium in situ. We, therefore, 1) investigated the morphological effects of our biochemical extraction procedure on human umbilical veins by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, 2) analyzed the subendothelial extract by immunofluorescence for the presence of vWF and collagens and by electron microscopy for morphological characteristics, and 3) localized vWF and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in subendothelium by immunofluorescence and by single- and double-label immunoelectron microscopic studies with protein A-conjugated gold particles. We found that the surface exposed following de-endothelialization is composed of microfibrils and contains very little fibrillar collagen. The subendothelium is stripped after sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea extraction, and the extract itself contains immunoreactive vWF and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen but no immunoreactive type I or III fibrillar collagens. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies showed that vWF and <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen are both present in subendothelium, where both co-localized to microfibrils. In conclusion, vWF that binds to <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in vitro, also co-localizes with <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen in subendothelium, where both are associated with microfibrils. <b>Type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen, therefore appears to serve as a biologically significant binding site for vWF in vivo and may thereby play a role in mediating platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium following vascular injury...|$|R

40|$|The {{collagen}} {{framework of}} the intervertebral disc contains two major fibril-forming collagens, types I and II. Smaller amounts {{of other types of}} collagen are also present. On examination of the nature and distribution of these minor collagens within bovine disc tissue, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen was found to be unusually abundant. It accounted for about 20 % of the total collagen in calf nucleus pulposus, and about 5 % in the annulus fibrosus. It was discovered by serially digesting disc tissue with chondroitin ABC lyase and Streptomyces hyaluronidase that native covalent polymers of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen could be extracted. Electron micrographs of this material prepared by rotary shadowing revealed the characteristic dimensions of tetramers and double tetramers of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> molecules, with their central rods and terminal globular domains. Molecular-sieve column chromatography on agarose under non-reducing non-denaturing conditions gave a series of protein peaks with molecular sizes equivalent to the tetramer, double tetramer and higher multimers. On SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis after disulphide cleavage, these fractions of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen all showed a main band at Mr 140, 000 and four lesser bands between Mr 180, 000 and 240, 000. On electrophoresis without disulphide cleavage in agarose/ 2. 4 % polyacrylamide only dimeric (six chains) and tetrameric (12 chains) forms of <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> molecules were present. The ability to extract all the <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen of the tissue in 4 M-guanidinium chloride, and absence of aldehyde-mediated cross-linking residues on direct analysis, showed that, in contrast with most matrix collagens, <b>type</b> <b>VI</b> collagen does not function as a covalently cross-linked structural polymer...|$|R
