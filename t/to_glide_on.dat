5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> <b>on</b> surfaces on {{a trail of}} slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans {{generally}} move slowly, {{though they}} have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> <b>on</b> surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object.|$|E

2500|$|Volaticotherium antiquum (gliding). A gliding eutriconodont, long {{considered}} the earliest gliding mammal until {{the discovery of}} contemporary gliding haramiyidans.

2500|$|Snowboards are boards {{where both}} feet are secured {{to the same}} board, which are wider than skis, with the ability <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> <b>on</b> snow. Snowboards widths are between 6 to 12 inches or 15 to 30 centimeters. Snowboards are {{differentiated}} from monoskis by the stance of the user. [...] In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board. [...] Users of such equipment may {{be referred to as}} snowboarders. Commercial snowboards generally require extra equipment such as bindings and special boots which help secure both feet of a snowboarder, who generally rides in an upright position. These types of boards are commonly used by people at ski hills or resorts for leisure, entertainment, and competitive purposes in the activity called snowboarding.|$|E
6000|$|... 71. I say the down-stroke is as {{effective}} as the bird chooses; that is to say, it can be given with exactly the quantity of impulse, and exactly the quantity of supporting power, required at the moment. Thus, when the bird wants to fly slowly, the wings are fluttered fast, giving vertical blows; if it wants to pause absolutely in still air, (this large birds cannot do, not being able to move their wings fast enough,) the velocity becomes vibration, as in the humming-bird: but if there is wind, any of the larger birds can lay themselves on it like a kite, their own weight answering the purpose of the string,[14] while they keep the wings and tail in an inclined plane, giving them as much gliding ascent as counteracts the fall. They nearly all, however, use some slightly gliding force at the same time; a single stroke of the wing, with forward intent, seeming enough to enable them <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> <b>on</b> for half a minute or more without stirring a plume. A circling eagle floats an inconceivable time without visible stroke: (fancy the pretty action of the inner wing, backing air instead of water, which gives exactly the breadth of circle he chooses). But for exhibition of the complete art of flight, a swallow on rough water is the master of masters. A sea-gull, with all its splendid power, generally has its work cut out for it, and is visibly fighting; but the swallow plays with wind and wave as a girl plays with her fan, and there are no words to say how many things it does with its wings in any ten seconds, and does consummately. The mystery of its dart remains always inexplicable to me; no eye can trace the bending of bow that sends that living arrow.|$|E
60|$|It was {{too early}} yet for the work to have begun in the dock. The water gleamed placidly, no {{movement}} anywhere in the long straight lines of the quays, no one about to be seen except the few dock hands busy alongside the Ferndale, knowing their work, mostly silent or exchanging a few words in low tones as if they, too, had been aware of that lady `who mustn't be disturbed.' The Ferndale was the only ship to leave that tide. The others seemed still asleep, without a sound, and only {{here and there a}} figure, coming up on the forecastle, leaned on the rail to watch the proceedings idly. Without trouble and fuss and almost without a sound was the Ferndale leaving the land, as if stealing away. Even the tugs, now with their engines stopped, were approaching her without a ripple, the burly-looking paddle-boat sheering forward, while the other, a screw, smaller and of slender shape, made for her quarter so gently that she did not divide the smooth water, but seemed <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> <b>on</b> its surface as if on a sheet of plate-glass, a man in her bow, the master at the wheel visible only from the waist upwards above the white screen of the bridge, both of them so still-eyed as to fascinate young Powell into curious self-forgetfulness and immobility. He was steeped, sunk in the general quietness, remembering the statement `she's a lady that mustn't be disturbed,' and repeating to himself idly: `No. She won't be disturbed. She won't be disturbed.' Then the first loud words of that morning breaking that strange hush of departure with a sharp hail: `Look out for that line there,' made him start. The line whizzed past his head, one of the sailors aft caught it, and there was an end to the fascination, to the quietness of spirit which had stolen on him at the very moment of departure. From that moment till two hours afterwards, when the ship was brought up in one of the lower reaches of the Thames off an apparently uninhabited shore, near some sort of inlet where nothing but two anchored barges flying a red flag could be seen, Powell was too busy to think of the lady `that mustn't be disturbed,' or of his captain--or of anything else unconnected with his immediate duties. In fact, he had no occasion to go on the poop, or even look that way much; but while the ship was about to anchor, casting his eyes in that direction, he received an absurd impression that his captain (he was up there, of course) was sitting {{on both sides of the}} aftermost skylight at once. He was too occupied to reflect on this curious delusion, this phenomenon of seeing double as though he had had a drop too much. He only smiled at himself.|$|E

50|$|ESCs {{designed}} for radio-control airplanes usually contain a few safety features.

40|$|From {{geometrical}} considerations it is shown that in long period ordered alloys some partial dislocations exist, leaving behind only a stacking fault without destroying the chemical order.

It is proposed that plastic deformation should take place either by twinning or propagation of widely extended stacking faults through several domains. A simple mechanism for crossing over domain boundaries is proposed : partial dislocations have <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> together <b>on</b> adjacent layers, {{in the sense that}} some convenient dislocation multipole has to be nucleated at the boundary.

5000|$|The {{development}} of the davit from its original [...] "goose neck form" [...] to the current devices advanced greatly when A.P.

Similar systems developed by Schat companies are used on offshore oil or gas rigs, being placed around the structure.|$|R

40|$|Mycoplasma mobile, a fish-pathogenic bacterium, {{features}} a protrusion that enables it <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> smoothly <b>on</b> solid surfaces at a velocity {{of up to}} 4. 5  µm s− 1 {{in the direction of}} the protrusion. M.  mobile glides by a repeated catch-pull-release of sialylated oligosaccharides fixed on a solid surface by hundreds of 50 -nm flexible “legs” sticking out from the protrusion. This gliding mechanism may be explained by a possible directed binding of each leg with sialylated oligosaccharides, by which the leg can be detached more easily forward than backward. In the present study, we used a polystyrene bead held by optical tweezers to detach a starved cell at rest from a glass surface coated with sialylated oligosaccharides and concluded that the detachment force forward is 1. 6 - to 1. 8 -fold less than that backward, which may be linked to a catch bond-like behavior of the cell. These results suggest that this directed binding has a critical role in the gliding mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the deep fasciae of limbs in order to {{evaluate}} the collagen and elastic fibre arrangement and the types of innervation. Histological and immunohistochemical stains were performed in 72 specimens. The deep fascia of the limbs is a sheath presenting a mean thickness of 1 mm, formed by two to three layers of parallel collagen fibre bundles. In the adjacent layers, they show different orientations. Each layer is separated from the adjacent one by loose connective tissue, permitting the sliding of the collagen layers. Nerve fibres were found in all specimens, while muscular fibres were evidenced only in one specimen. The described structure permits the fasciae of the limbs to have a strong resistance to traction, even when exercised in different directions. The capacity of the different collagen layers <b>to</b> <b>glide</b> one <b>on</b> the other could be altered in cases of overuse syndrome, trauma, or surgery...|$|R
