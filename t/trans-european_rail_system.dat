50|$|The Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI) are {{specifications}} {{drafted by}} the European Railway Agency and adopted in a Decision by the European Commission, to ensure the interoperability of the <b>trans-European</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b> The interoperability issues apply to the lines within the Trans-European Rail network. The European Railway Agency regularly publishes {{a summary of the}} status of the TSIs.|$|E
5000|$|The European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) is {{the agency}} of the European Union (EU) that sets {{mandatory}} requirements for European railways and manufacturers {{in the form of}} Technical Specifications for Interoperability, which apply to the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>system.</b> The ERA publishes a document summarizing the status of the TSIs. [...] The ERA sets common safety targets, common safety methods and common safety indicators, following Directive 2004/49/EC and amendments. The ERA also hosts a number of databases, among which a register of remaining, applicable national rules.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 a {{development}} plan first mentioned {{the creation of}} the European <b>Rail</b> Traffic Management <b>System.</b> In 1996 the first specification for ETCS followed in response to EU Council Directive 96/48/EC99 on interoperability of the <b>trans-European</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{specification}} {{was written}} in 1996 in response to EU Council Directive 96/48/EC99 of 23 July 1996 on interoperability of the <b>trans-European</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>system.</b> First the European Railway Research Institute was instructed to formulate the specification and {{about the same time}} the ERTMS User Group was formed from six railway operators that took over the lead role in the specification. The standardisation went on {{for the next two years}} and it was felt to be slow for some industry partners - 1998 saw the formation of Union of Signalling Industry (UNISIG), including Alstom, Ansaldo, Bombardier, Invensys, Siemens and Thales that were to take over the finalisation of the standard.|$|R

30|$|The EN 14531 (first draft 2003) {{describes}} the fundamental algorithms and calculations {{for the design}} of brake equipment for railway vehicles. The procedure provides the calculation of various aspects related to the performance: stopping or slowing distances, dissipated energy, force calculations, and immobilization braking. For the purposes of this work, the Part 6 of the regulation: “Application to high-speed trains” is of interest. The general algorithm to calculate braking distances is described in the regulation: the input data consist of train and brake characteristics, and the method to estimate the deceleration as a combination of different braking forces acting on the train is suggested {{as a function of the}} initial speed [1]. Moreover, the criteria for the technical and operational compatibility between the infrastructures and the rolling stock are defined in L. 245 / 402 technical specification for interoperability (TSI) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in 2002. The essential requirements for <b>trans-European</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> are related to safety, reliability, availability, health, environmental protection, and technical compatibility. Notably, the brake system requirements for high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> are established; i.e., the minimum braking performance is defined as the minimum deceleration and evaluated as a function of speed [2]. On the other hand, the European norm UIC 544 - 1 (4 th edition, October 2004) defines the method for computation of the braking power through the braked mass and determination of the deceleration [3].|$|R
50|$|The <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Rail</b> {{network is}} made up of the <b>Trans-European</b> {{high-speed}} <b>rail</b> network as well as the <b>Trans-European</b> conventional <b>rail</b> network.

50|$|The <b>Trans-European</b> {{conventional}} <b>rail</b> network, {{together with}} the <b>Trans-European</b> high-speed <b>rail</b> network, make up the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Rail</b> network, {{which in turn is}} {{one of a number of}} the European Union's Trans-European transport networks (TEN-T).

40|$|Through the {{territory}} of the Republic of Macedonia pass two important <b>trans-European</b> <b>rail</b> corridors - N 8 (East - West) that connect the Adriatic Balkan region and sides of the Black Sea corridor and N 10 (North - South), connecting parties of Western Europe with Greece. These corridors are part of the Macedonian government to build the missing pieces of the railway infrastructure of the Republic of Macedonia. The project aims are to develop and propose strategies for transport by rail transport routes of <b>trans-European</b> <b>rail</b> corridors N 10 and N 8, in order to ensure and meet national and international needs.

The HSR lines include those specially built for the speeds equal to or greater than 250  km/h (Category I), those specially upgraded for the speeds of the order of 200  km/h (Category II), and those upgraded with the particular features resulting from the topographical relief or the town-planning constraints (Category III).
