5|$|The Lakers {{have traded}} guard Kareem Rush to the Charlotte Bobcats for two future second round draft picks (Ronny Turiaf and Patrick Beverly). The Bobcats have {{acquired}} {{a second round}} pick (Ronny Turiaf) in the 2005 NBA Draft from Atlanta in exchange for forward/center Predrag Drobnjak. Atlanta Hawks acquired centers Michael Doleac (from the New York Knicks) and Joel Przybilla (from the Milwaukee Bucks), along with a 2005 second-round pick from the Knicks (Ronny Turiaf), while sending center Nazr Mohammed to the Knicks in the <b>three-way</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cammalleri was {{involved}} in trade rumours following his arbitration hearing, which was considered contentious. At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft held on June 20, he was dealt to the Calgary Flames {{as part of a}} <b>three-way</b> <b>trade.</b> The Kings received Anaheim's first round pick, 12th overall, and a second round pick from Calgary, while the Ducks received Calgary's first round pick, 17th overall, and Los Angeles' 28th overall selection.

5000|$|Despite the {{geographical}} {{proximity of the}} borders of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, the issues of border control and territorial sovereignty have obviously prevented the establishment of direct trade routes. Banglabandha was functioning as a [...] "Land Customs Station" [...] (LCS) before the Government of Bangladesh decided to establish an inland port. To exploit the potential of a <b>three-way</b> <b>trading</b> post, the government of Bangladesh decided to develop an inland port, with facilities such as customs, banking, warehouses, police and immigration posts. It {{was designed to be}} Bangladesh's first [...] "export-oriented" [...] inland port, explicitly promoting the transport of Bangladeshi goods to Nepal, India and Bhutan; other Bangladeshi inland ports are mainly used to import goods from India. Nepal favours such an inland port to enable access for its goods to the Mongla and Chittagong seaports.|$|R
5000|$|Sanderson went 4-2 in nine {{starts in}} {{his rookie season}} with the Expos, posting a 2.51 ERA.

5000|$|In March 2016, Galaxy {{combined}} WZUN-FM's DJs with WSEN-FM's on-air staff. The newly merged {{station at}} 102.1 was initially expected {{to carry the}} [...] "WSEN-FM" [...] call sign. This {{turned out not to}} be the case, as Craig Fox, who was purchasing FM 92.1, parked the WSEN call letters on his own rival station on 103.9 FM. WZUN once again came under the ownership of Galaxy Communications, after it got its grandfather clause status reinstated. Galaxy bought the 102.1 license back from Mack on February 29. The move was made as WSEN-FM's previous frequency, 92.1, was traded away to Craig Fox in a <b>three-way</b> station <b>trade</b> that involved Fox, Galaxy and the religious Family Life Network.|$|R
25|$|In the 2008–2009 {{transfer}} window, Mumbai Indians conducted {{two straight}} swap deals, {{with no money}} exchanged. Ashish Nehra was swapped with Shikhar Dhawan of Delhi Daredevils and {{on the last day}} of the transfer window, Robin Uthappa was swapped with parekh Apurva of Royal Challengers Bangalore, who plays for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy. In a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade,</b> Jaydev Shah of the Rajasthan Royals – captain of the Saurashtra Ranji squad that made it to the semi-finals and son of former cricket board secretary Niranjan Shah – will move to the Mumbai Indians.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2001–02 season, the Gunds {{sold the}} Sharks {{to a group}} of local investors headed by team {{president}} Greg Jamison. With starting goaltender Nabokov and defenseman Mike Rathje in contract disputes with General Manager Dean Lombardi and the retirement of veteran defenseman Gary Suter, the team got off to a terrible start. Kyle McLaren was acquired in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. Dan McGillis was acquired in exchange for long-time Shark Marcus Ragnarsson, but the team could not turn itself around. Sutter was fired and replaced by Ron Wilson midway through that season.|$|E
25|$|The Red Sox {{caught the}} Tampa Bay Rays {{during the summer}} as the Rays began to decline slightly. While the pennant race caught fire, Manny Ramirez did not {{want any part of}} it since the Red Sox did not offer him a {{sufficient}} contract for the 2009 season. As a result, Manny Ramirez went to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> involving the Pittsburgh Pirates. The trade brought Jason Bay to the Red Sox. In September, the Rays held on to win the Eastern Division title with a 97–65 record. As for Boston, they won 95 games with a Wildcard berth. After defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALDS once again, they lost to the Rays in a seven-game ALCS.|$|E
25|$|Entering 2010, the Tigers parted {{ways with}} Curtis Granderson and Edwin Jackson {{as part of}} a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the New York Yankees and Arizona Diamondbacks; in return they picked up outfield {{prospect}} Austin Jackson and pitchers Phil Coke, Max Scherzer and Daniel Schlereth. Key losses included Plácido Polanco, Fernando Rodney and Brandon Lyon, who all left via free agency. Key signings included a five-year contract extension for ace Justin Verlander, and the acquisitions of All-Star closer José Valverde and two-time World Series champion Johnny Damon. Austin Jackson made the Tigers opening day roster, and was American League Rookie of the Month for April. 2010 also saw the debut of Brennan Boesch, who was named the AL Rookie of the Month for May and June.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to close the gap}} of the huge losses that the club {{incurred}} in 2011, the Suns offered zone pick Dayne Zorko in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> that resulted in key defender Matthew Warnock joining the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast also used their no.4 pick in the 2011 AFL Draft to acquire the first selection in mini-draft. The mini-draft allowed teams to pre-list 17-year-old players for the 2013 season and the Suns used their selection to sign West Australian Jaeger O'Meara. The team then travelled to Arizona in November to complete a two-week high altitude training camp. Coach Guy McKenna labelled the trip a growing experience for the youthful squad. The benefits of the trip were seen almost immediately as majority of the playing group recorded personal bests in January.|$|E
25|$|During the 2017 offseason, Anthony {{demanded a}} trade after {{multiple}} conflicts with then-team president Phil Jackson. Originally, the only teams {{for which he}} would waive his no trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets. However, due to increasing concerns with the Cavaliers' stability within the organization, from the team having no general manager {{at the time to}} trade demands from Kyrie Irving, he later decided to seek a trade where he would only end up with the Rockets. Originally, the Rockets had a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the Portland Trail Blazers setup involving Ryan Anderson, but with the Knicks changing its front office after parting ways with Phil Jackson, they decided to withhold the trade to the Rockets altogether. After more concerns with the Knicks and the new Knicks' front office stating their expectations clearly to the media, Anthony decided to expand his list of teams to include the Cavaliers again and the Oklahoma City Thunder.|$|E
25|$|In March 1978, the Golden Gaters {{acquired}} Virginia Wade in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> {{with the}} Apples and the Seattle Cascades. Under the deal, Wade {{went from the}} Apples to the Golden Gaters, JoAnne Russell went from the Cascades to the Apples and Marita Redondo went from the Golden Gaters to the Cascades. Redondo did not play in WTT in 1977. After the 1977 season, she had been drafted by the Golden Gaters but not signed. Tom Okker {{did not return to}} WTT for the 1978 season. He played clay-court tournaments in Europe which conflict with the WTT schedule. Player-coach Frew McMillan was the only Golden Gaters returning player in 1978. In addition to newcomers Mayer and Wade, Ilana Kloss returned to the league and the team after a two-year absence, and the Golden Gaters signed Michael Wayman and Marise Kruger. In June, the Golden Gaters hired Tom Dietrich as assistant coach replacing Henry Schneidman who remained with the organization. Just {{before the start of the}} playoffs, the Golden Gaters signed Tom Leonard who was a regular member of the playoff lineup.|$|E
25|$|Following Jackson's departure, the Knicks {{appointed}} Scott Perry as President of Basketball Operations. The Knicks {{also saw}} Carmelo Anthony demanding a trade from the franchise, which posed difficulty for both player and franchise {{due to a}} no-trade clause inserted in Anthony's contract given by Jackson in 2013. Originally, the only teams for which he would waive his no trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets, with the former eventually removed from trade discussions due to internal conflicts. Anthony intended to solely join the Rockets, who had a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the Portland Trail Blazers set up involving Ryan Anderson, whose three-year, $60 million contract was not feasibly able to be absorbed by either franchise. Perry then ceased talks with the Rockets, before agreeing {{a deal with the}} Oklahoma City Thunder, after Anthony agreed to expand his no-trade clause to include the Thunder. The Knicks received Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick in exchange for Anthony on September 25, 2017, while also now positioning Kristaps Porziņģis as the new centerpiece of the franchise.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, the Knicks {{shook up}} the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Brian Cardinal and cash considerations. A day later, the Knicks and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for {{shooting}} guard Eddie House. The deal also included forward Marcus Landry {{going to the}} Celtics and the Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker. The Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade.</b> The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space. About three weeks after these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest win of the season. However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, a regression from their first season under D'Antoni.|$|E
25|$|Several reasons {{have been}} given for the Lakers' early success {{including}} improved play by Lamar Odom, Pau Gasol and a better bench. The Lakers also have a light schedule during {{the early part of}} the season, playing most games at home while only three of the first 14 teams they've played have had winning records. This has also allowed Bryant to play a reduced role and stay fresher. The Lakers managed to jump out to a 13–2 start before losing their final three games of November. The Lakers extended their losing streak to four before beating the Sacramento Kings 113–80 on December 3. The Lakers started a seven-game December road trip by beating the Los Angeles Clippers 87–86 after Derek Fisher made the game winning layup as time expired. During the road trip they visited President Barack Obama in Washington, D.C. for the second time in 2010. Bynum played his first game of the season coming of the bench against the Washington Wizards on December 14 after missing the first 24 games of the season. On December 15, the Lakers were involved in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> that sent Sasha Vujačić and a protected (No.1-No.18) 2011 first round draft pick to the New Jersey Nets in return for Joe Smith and the Nets' second round picks they acquired from the Golden State Warriors and Chicago Bulls, respectively. The Lakers will also receive the draft rights to Sergei Lishouk from the Houston Rockets, as well as a trade exception.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2011 NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a four-year contract worth approximately $58 million. In return, the Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent to the Wizards to complete the <b>three-way</b> <b>trade.</b> The Knicks also obtained the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement. To replace Billups at point guard, the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, veteran minimum contract. The Knicks also signed veteran point guard Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team's starting point guard. The Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated. Subsequently, rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles. In addition, head coach D'Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing to the stagnation of the Knicks' offense.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 {{free agency}} period, the Suns traded Steve Nash to the Los Angeles Lakers in {{exchange}} for first-round picks in 2013 and 2015, as well as second-round picks in 2013 and 2014. After the trade, the Suns then re-acquired point guard Goran Dragić from Houston, signed Minnesota Timberwolves forward Michael Beasley, and claimed Houston forward Luis Scola off amnesty waivers while also using the same amnesty clause (as codified in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement) to waive Josh Childress. They also did a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the New Orleans Hornets and the Timberwolves by trading Robin Lopez and Hakim Warrick to the Hornets and a 2014 second-rounder to the Timberwolves {{in exchange for}} Wesley Johnson, a top 14-protected future first-rounder, and the rights to Brad Miller and Jerome Dyson. The latter two players' rights were later waived and the Suns then signed Jermaine O'Neal for one year. The Suns also signed P. J. Tucker based on his performance with the Suns' Summer League team. On September 20, {{it was announced that}} Channing Frye had dilated cardiomyopathy and as a result, he missed the entire 2012–13 season, although he sometimes made special appearances to do the pre-game show for local Suns games with Tom Leander and Tom Chambers. On January 12, 2013, the Suns became the fourth-fastest NBA team to win 2,000 games with a 97–81 road victory against the Chicago Bulls, which also marked the last victory for Alvin Gentry as head coach for the Suns. On January 18, 2013, the day after a loss that broke a 24-home-game winning streak against the Milwaukee Bucks, Gentry agreed to leave the Phoenix Suns organization. Two days later, player development coach Lindsey Hunter was named interim head coach role {{for the remainder of the}} season. A few days later, assistant head coaches Dan Majerle and Elston Turner had also resigned from their positions. On February 21, 2013, it was announced that the Suns had traded their 2013 second-round pick to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Marcus Morris, the twin brother of power forward Markieff Morris. A day later, the Suns traded point guard Sebastian Telfair to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Iranian center Hamed Haddadi and a 2014 second-round pick. The Suns ended their first post-Steve Nash season with a 25–57 win-loss record, which was their second-worst record in franchise history, behind only their inaugural season.|$|E
500|$|The year {{began with}} the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, which saw the Flames select forward Greg Nemisz with their first round selection. [...] The Flames made several trades during the draft, {{acquiring}} forward Mike Cammalleri from the Los Angeles Kings {{as part of a}} <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> that saw Calgary deal the 17th overall pick to the Anaheim Ducks. [...] They then sent Alex Tanguay to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for the 25th overall pick, with each team adding lower round picks to the deal. The Flames signed forward Todd Bertuzzi during the off-season, a move that generated controversy amongst a fan base with which he had been previously unpopular. Calgary was also active at the trade deadline, making three deals, including a significant trade to add Olli Jokinen from the Phoenix Coyotes.|$|E
500|$|As the 1951 season began, Zoldak {{was part}} of a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade.</b> On April 30, 1951, he was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics along with Ray Murray, which also {{involved}} the Chicago White Sox. Manager Jimmy Dykes brought Zoldak onto the Athletics with the intention of putting him in the starting rotation in place of Lou Brissie, who had been sent to the Indians in the same trade. On July 15, Zoldak pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago White Sox in what was called [...] "the greatest game of his career," [...] and followed that up with a complete game against the Indians, allowing one run in nearly ten innings of work. In 26 games for the Athletics, 18 of them starts, he had a 610 record and a 3.16 ERA. Before the 1952 season began, manager Dykes planned on giving Zoldak more rest between starts to try and maximize on what he could provide for the team, as he had been growing tired when overused during the season. Zoldak pitched in 16 games in 1952, and had a 06 record and a 4.06 ERA.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1990–91 season, the Jazz {{made another}} move {{to improve the}} team, with a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> being made. [...] Shooting guard Jeff Malone was brought to Utah from the Washington Bullets, while Eric Leckner and Bob Hansen were sent from Utah to the Sacramento Kings, and Pervis Ellison ended up going from Sacramento to Washington.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 35th season, Ginebra was included in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with Burger King and Purefoods. They sent Paul Artadi, Rafi Reavis, and 8th draft pick Chris Timberlake to Purefoods for Enrico Villanueva, Rich Alvarez, Paolo Bugia, and Celino Cruz. They also traded their eighteenth draft pick Orlando Daroya to Burger King for Pocholo Villanueva, but Villanueva {{never made it to}} the team. Meanwhile, they released guard Macky Escalona, and forward J. R. Aquino to free-agency and waived center Homer Se. They also released guard Chris Pacana, who was later signed by the Sta. Lucia Realtors [...] and placed forward Junjun Cabatu to the practice player list. On other reports, Ginebra coach Jong Uichico confirmed that they signed Eric Menk to a one-year contract extension for the Kings. Ginebra then released guard Chico Lanete and was later signed by the Burger King Whoppers. Prior to this release, they signed Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters 18th overall pick Kevin White to a one-year deal.|$|E
2500|$|The team payroll for 2000 {{increased}} to $33 million, {{nearly double the}} $17.9 million from the previous season. [...] However, Loria's options for rebuilding the team were somewhat limited. [...] He discovered {{that he needed to}} improve the team immediately in order to win back the fans' trust, rather than relying on long-term improvements via the draft. [...] Even with the team's renewed willingness to spend more on talent, most elite players were reluctant to play in Montreal, given the franchise's uncertain future and Olympic Stadium's poor playing conditions. As a result, most of the increased payroll came from the signings of free agent pitchers Graeme Lloyd and Hideki Irabu, as well as a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the Rangers and Blue Jays that brought Rangers first baseman Lee Stevens to Montreal. [...] These moves failed to translate into on-field success: Lloyd missed the entire season due to arthroscopic surgery, Irabu posted a 7.24 ERA, and Stevens only batted [...]265. The Expos lost 95 games. Interest in the team continued to decline, as both fans and businesses were unwilling to lend their support to a noncompetitive team.|$|E
2500|$|The Indians {{entered the}} 2013 season {{following}} an active offseason {{that resulted in}} a dramatic roster turnover. [...] Key acquisitions included free agent 1B/OF Nick Swisher and CF Michael Bourn. The Indians also added prized right handed pitching prospect Trevor Bauer, OF Drew Stubbs, and relief pitchers Bryan Shaw & [...] Matt Albers in a <b>three-way</b> <b>trade</b> with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds that sent RF Shin-Soo Choo to the Reds, and Tony Sipp to the Arizona Diamondbacks Other notable additions included utility man Mike Aviles, catcher Yan Gomes, designated hitter Jason Giambi, and starting pitcher Scott Kazmir. [...] The 2013 Indians were able to increase their win total by 24 over 2012 (from 68 to 92), finishing in second place behind Detroit by one game in the Central Division, and securing the number one seed in the American League Wild Card standings. [...] This marked the Indians' first time in postseason play since 2007. [...] The 2013 season ended for the Indians on October 2, losing 4–0 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2013 AL Wild Card Game.
