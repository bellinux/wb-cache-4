5|$|The Mediterranean climate, natural attractions, and {{historic}} heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism, and responsible for nine percent of Turkey's tourism sector and <b>thirty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> foreign purchases {{of real estate}} in Turkey. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population. Warm-weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya. In 2014 Mayor Adem Murat Yücel, of the Nationalist Movement Party unseated Hasan Sipahioğlu, of the Justice and Development Party, who had previously led the city since 1999.|$|E

It was swiftly pulled from theater distribution because of its poor performance at the box office, and was never shown in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{departed for}} the Western Front in June 1918 {{to join the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF). The division's advance detachment reached Brest, France on 8 June. In late September, the29th received orders to join the U.S. First Army's Meuse-Argonne Offensive {{as part of the}} French XVII Corps. During its 21 days in combat, the 29th Division advanced seven kilometers, captured 2,148 prisoners, and knocked out over 250 machine guns or artillery pieces. <b>Thirty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the division became casualties—170 officers and 5,691 enlisted men were killed or wounded. Shortly thereafter the Armistice with Germany was signed on November 11, 1918, ending hostilities between the Central Powers and the Allied Powers. The division returned to the United States in May 1919. It demobilized on 30 May at Camp Dix, New Jersey, though it remained an active National Guard unit.|$|E
5|$|Classified as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN due to ongoing habitat destruction and {{a decline in}} the quality of the remaining habitat, the long-tailed ground roller {{is believed to be the}} most threatened species of ground roller. <b>Thirty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> its already small habitat area was degraded between the mid-1970s and 2000. Slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, logging, and cattle grazing have all contributed to the loss of habitat. As of 2012, no reserves protect any portion of its habitat, and as a result its habitat has been described as the area of Madagascar most in need of conservation efforts. It is also threatened by both hunting and egg-collecting. In addition to humans, dogs hunt this species, and the introduced black rat is a nest predator. This ground roller is capable of tolerating some habitat disturbance, but requires a suitable amount of shade and leaf litter to continue living in the area. Although it was fairly common at the beginning of the twentieth century, its population went into decline and it was considered rare by the 1960s. As of 2012, the estimated population of the long-tailed ground roller is between 9,500 and 32,700 birds and declining.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of <b>thirty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained {{the law of the land}} when the 44th Congress's term expired.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} decreased from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers switching from SIRT to city-operated buses due to a bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. <b>Thirty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the company's personnel were laid off. On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the orders}} of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces had {{constructed}} {{a large number of}} static defensive positions and obstacles. Rommel had been appointed Inspector General of Coastal Defences and commander of Army Group B, in November 1943, by order of Adolf Hitler. On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and immediately began the process of improving them, particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than <b>thirty</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the German defences were adequate. These anti-airborne measures consisted of planting a large number of mines to create minefields, as well as the erection of so-called Rommel's asparagus; a system of wire-braced poles up to two metres in height, a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby-traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops. Rommel noted in his diary, following an inspection of one area, that a division had placed over 300,000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings, and a corps had erected over 900,000. The Merville artillery battery was a particularly heavily fortified position. From the beach, it was protected by two strongpoints that included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post, and the battery itself consisted of a bunker containing the battery's command post, two blockhouses, a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150mm. The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire, a minefield, and an outer perimeter of barbed wire as well as an anti-tank ditch.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{solutions}} {{have been}} progressively being adopted in clinical settings. Real-time data access {{is expected to}} improve the efficiency of clinical work. We built a hospital-wide Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) that connects PDAs. A PDA application for nursing documentation {{was the first to}} be implemented. In this study, we compared the patterns of PDA and desktop data entry by the nurses in a large academic hospital in Japan. During the study period, 98, 633 records were entered. <b>Thirty</b> seven <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the data were entered via a PDA and 63 % from desktop PCs. <b>Thirty</b> seven <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the nurses used PDA for entering more than 50 % of the data. <b>Thirty</b> five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the nurses used PDAs for less than 10 % of the data.
