50|$|In the English {{speaking}} world, {{the recognition}} of sport pedagogy as a discipline is more recent. In 1989, the notable German researcher Herbert Haag observed that {{the meaning of the}} term 'sport pedagogy' was not as yet fully established in the English speaking sport science literature. Nevertheless, Haag confirmed the ascendence and usefulness of the term 'sport pedagogy' to communicate about research in learning and <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> and sport to international academic audiences in this field. The relatively late adoption of the term 'sport pedagogy' in the English speaking academic literature is also observed by the distinguished Australian researcher Richard Tinning (2008, p. 405) who notes that ‘notwithstanding the fact that our European colleagues had been using the terms pedagogy and sport pedagogy for many years, the English-speaking world of kinesiology has only relatively recently embraced the terms.’ Nonetheless, Tinning observes that sport pedagogy is now ‘firmly established as a credible academic subdiscipline’.|$|E

The study was designed to challenge PETE pre-service teachers ’ thinking about sport curriculum and pedagogy in physical education, introduce them to new thinking about models and specifically, the sport literacy model (Drummond & Pill, 2011; Pill, 2009, 2010). Details of the research design are presented and the insights that the data have provided in relation to challenges and opportunities that teacher educators and teacher education courses confront in seeking to promote and support curriculum and pedagogical innovation are discussed...|$|E

Thus, we can conclude that most graduates of <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> do not receive guidance for their incorporation into the labour world.

The paper explains that {{physical education teacher education}} programs have the potential to fall under the guise of out-of-field teaching. Teacher preparation programs house an array of courses from the applied sciences and allied fields of physical education, which can stand alone as separate fields of study yet are possible out-of-field teaching assignments. People who are pursuing employment in predominantly undergraduate institutions within physical education teacher education programs must be able to teach within several content areas, yet {{more than half of the}} doctoral degree granting programs in physical education-pedagogy offer only specialized curriculums. When teachers are assigned to courses outside their area of study, the curriculum is weakened by fragmented content knowledge.

Purpose: In {{light of}} the extensive empirical evidence that implicit theories have important motivational consequences for young people {{across a range of}} educational settings we seek to provide a summary of, and personal reflection on, implicit theory research and practice in physical education (PE). Overview: We first provide an introduction to the key constructs and theoretical propositions associated with implicit theories. We then include a brief summary of the research findings on ability beliefs in school PE, which we draw on to identify several key issues that we feel are crucial to furthering our understanding of this topic. We conclude by offering a number of ideas for future research and discuss the potential misinterpretation of implicit theories when applied to professional practice in PE. Conclusion: We argue that researchers need to address more nuanced questions around implicit theories to prevent this area of inquiry stalling. Moreover, we need to provide teachers with more specific recommendations to help them integrate theory and research into practice...|$|E
