5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> the water level is somewhat shallow. Hunting mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at some times, and with some populations. In certain countries, the mallard may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E
5|$|The Joseph F. Glidden House {{is located}} in the United States in the DeKalb County, Illinois city of DeKalb. It was the home to the famed {{inventor}} of barbed wire Joseph Glidden. The barn, still located on the property near several commercial buildings, is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> Glidden perfected his improved version of barbed wire which would eventually transform him into a successful entrepreneur. The Glidden House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The home was designed by another barbed wire patent holder in DeKalb, Jacob Haish.|$|E
5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} {{on the reverse}} side, which {{probably would have been}} used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E

5|$|The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two nights to film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> the original story was set.|$|E

The Greek Orthodox allege that the real place that Jesus was held was the similarly named Prison of Christ, in their Monastery of the Praetorium, located near the Church of Ecce Homo, at the first station on the Via Dolorosa. The Armenians regard a recess in the Monastery of the Flagellation, a building near the second station on the Via Dolorosa, as the Prison of Christ. A cistern among the ruins near the Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu is also alleged {{to have been the}} Prison of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Hybridization capture {{with the}} {{selector}} probe set is performed on tumor DNA from a biopsy and sequenced {{to a depth}} of ~10,000× coverage. The biotinylated selector probes bind selectively to the regions of the DNA library that were chosen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> the recurrently mutations occur in the given cancer type. In this way you are left with a smaller library that is enriched for only the regions you want, which can then be sequenced. This allows the determination of patient specific mutations. Hybridization capture with the same selector is then performed on ctDNA from the blood to quantify the previously identified mutations in the patient. CAPP-Seq can be applied to ctDNA from multiple blood samples at different time points in order to follow tumor evolution.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by the {{advances}} {{being made in}} the area of localized function within the brain, Paul Broca committed much of his study to the phenomena of how speech is understood and produced. Through his study, it was discovered and expanded upon that we articulate via the left hemisphere. Broca's observations and methods are widely considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> neuropsychology really takes form as a recognizable and respected discipline. Armed with the understanding that specific, independent areas of the brain are responsible for articulation and understanding of speech, the brains abilities were finally being acknowledged as the complex and highly intricate organ that it is. Broca was essentially the first to fully break away from the ideas of phrenology and delve deeper into a more scientific and psychological view of the brain.|$|E
25|$|By 7 June {{fighting}} led the Jordanians {{to withdraw}} from the West Bank, and Jerusalem's Old City and the Dome of the Rock were abandoned after desperate fighting. Israel blew up the bridges between the two banks to consolidate its control. Jordan suffered a severe setback with the loss of the West Bank, which contributed 40% to Jordan's GDP in the tourism, industrial, and agricultural sectors. Around 200,000 Palestinian refugees fled to Jordan, destablizing Jordan's demographics. The loss of Jerusalem was critical to Jordan, and specifically for Hussein who held the Hashemite custodianship of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> Muhammad ascended to heaven. By 11June Israel had decisively won the war by capturing the West Bank from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Nasser and Hussein, recognizing their defeat, sought to work together towards a more moderate stance.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} archaeological {{sciences}} {{are used in}} underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including {{the area where the}} timber was harvested (i.e. likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>where</b> the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence {{on the nature of the}} landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, erosion by rivers and deposition by rivers or in the sea.|$|E

500|$|After {{directing}} The Last of the Mohicans, Mann {{decided to}} remake L.A. Takedown {{into a wide}} release cinema feature. He viewed the film as a dry run for the original story, which was a complex, multi-layered crime drama axed for the television film. He consulted a longer 1986 draft {{to work on the}} remake. Having made L.A. Takedown, Mann felt he had a much better idea of how he wanted to structure the remake, saying: [...] "I charted the film out like a 2 hr 45 min piece of music, so I'd know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smooth, <b>where</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smooth, <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> staccato, <b>where</b> <b>to</b> use a pulse like a heartbeat." ...|$|R
