Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, {{it is not so much}} hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, we lost our enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G.

The record company wanted the Barrio Boyzz and Selena to record the tune, the two were unaware {{of each other and}} were acquainted to record the song.

The song was included in the 1993 sophomore album of the same name by the Barrio Boyzz, the album was later certified platinum (Latin field) for shipments of 100,000 units in the United States.

Although O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general (except of Teal'c), O'Neill begins to accept Jonas at the end of [...] "Redemption" [...] yet finds it hard to ever significantly warm up to Jonas, something which Nemec felt [...] "makes things much more interesting". Tapping added that Jonas inadvertently brings the three remaining SG-1 members closer together again. Jonas's [...] "easy-going nature" [...] later helps him to also establish relationships with the supporting characters Dr. Janet Fraiser and General George Hammond, whom Nemec regarded [...] "very much [...] a father figure in Jonas's eyes".|$|E

When playing at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1978, the film was described in the program notes as, [...] "...a nightmarish poem which plays on our fears of irrational and uncontrolled violence." [...] Carpenter has said that the British audiences immediately understood and enjoyed the film's similarities to American westerns, whereas American audiences were <b>too</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the western genre to fully appreciate the movie at first.|$|E
