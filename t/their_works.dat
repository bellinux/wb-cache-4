5000|$|In 1907, {{when there}} were only half a dozen viable {{galleries}} in Paris, he made contracts with artists to buy all of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> in order to free them from financial worries and permit them to concentrate on <b>their</b> creative <b>work.</b> He met with them daily to discuss <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> photographed each work they produced (he felt it imperative to have a record), held exhibitions of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> and promoted <b>their</b> <b>work</b> internationally. Since he considered himself friends with many of them, he co-owned little sailing boats with his artists.|$|R

5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing <b>their</b> <b>works.</b> He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E

5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession {{and the nature}} of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and has rarely been presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses <b>their</b> <b>works)</b> once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but <b>their</b> <b>works</b> were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|By 1942 Pane {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} playwrights in Java, together with El Hakim (pseud. Aboe Hanifah) and Usmar Ismail. <b>Their</b> <b>works</b> often dealt with politics, a sense of nationalism, and the influence of one's environment—particularly tradition, ethics, and religion. As with Kami, Perempuan, these works were oriented around everyday events and featured average people, as opposed to the earlier stories based in mythology and telling of gods and goddesses.|$|E

5|$|Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were {{influenced}} by the Tachtigers, a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s. Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in <b>their</b> <b>works</b> was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society. As opposed to earlier works published by Balai Pustaka such as Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), which emphasized regional cultural values, prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity, and writers included areas {{that they had never}} visited. Old themes, such as forced marriage, were abandoned. According to Sutherland, most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in <b>their</b> <b>works.</b> Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago, these nationalist writers embraced Western culture; Sutherland writes that some of the most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized.|$|E

5|$|From {{the autumn}} of 1894, the hall was adopted as the venue for the annual winter season of concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London, which had {{formerly}} been held at St James's Hall. At the first Philharmonic concert at the Queen's Hall, Alexander Mackenzie conducted the first performance in England of Tchaikovsky's Pathétique Symphony, which was so well received that it was repeated, by popular acclaim, at the next concert. During the 1894–95 season, Edvard Grieg and Camille Saint-Saëns conducted performances of <b>their</b> <b>works.</b> The Society remained at the Queen's Hall until 1941.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} relations of multiple indicators of work identity and family identity {{with the number}} of weekly hours worked by 193 married business professionals.

Women 2 ̆ 7 s work hours, on the other hand, were associated with <b>their</b> <b>work</b> and family identities when weak situational demands permitted discretion over <b>their</b> <b>work</b> hours.

5|$|In music, birdsong has {{influenced}} composers and musicians in several ways: {{they can be}} inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi and Beethoven did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into <b>their</b> <b>works,</b> first seen {{in the work of}} Ottorino Respighi; or as Beatrice Harrison did in 1924 with a nightingale, and David Rothenberg did in 2000 with a laughingthrush, they can duet with birds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, America {{produced}} diverse composers such as Anthony Heinrich, who composed in an idiosyncratic, intentionally American style {{and was the}} first American composer to write for a symphony orchestra. Many other composers, most famously William Henry Fry and George Frederick Bristow, supported the idea of an American classical style, though <b>their</b> <b>works</b> were very European in orientation. It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe. Paine's example inspired the composers of the Second New England School, which included such figures as Amy Beach, Edward MacDowell, and Horatio Parker.|$|E

5|$|Innis's {{theories}} of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: {{he had a}} profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, <b>their</b> <b>works</b> advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both <b>their</b> <b>works</b> brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{underground}} {{organizations and}} individuals – {{in particular the}} Polish Underground State – saved much of Poland's most valuable cultural treasures, and worked to salvage as many cultural institutions and artifacts as possible.
