While we can't talk about DLC right now, I'd say the content easily amounts to {{hundreds and hundreds of}} hours. I mean, you can play competitive, co-op, multiple modes", Richmond continued, [...] "I just can't quantify it enough". On October 14, 2011, Justin Richmond, confirmed that it won't be releasing any downloadable content for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deceptions single-player mode. [...] "There's a very specific reason," [...] said Richmond. [...] "Whenever we sit down and <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> some single-player DLC, someone pitches something and we realize – that's a five hour level." [...] "Dialling back our ambition is difficult," [...] added Arne Meyer, Naughty Dog's Community Strategist. [...] "We'd rather build out another game than we would do episodic content," [...] continued Richmond. [...] "We're so small that we can't afford to have a whole team working on DLC." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "For you, sir--from my father," [...] replied Pedgift, [...] "inclosed in one to myself. Perhaps {{you will}} {{allow me to}} suggest, by way of {{preparing}} you for--for something a little unpleasant--that we shall want a particularly good dinner to-day; and (if they're not performing any modern German music to-night) I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> well to finish the evening melodiously at the Opera." ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{and then}} Sir Walter said, seriously: [...] "Well, Mr. Wilson, I am not a detective, and these unhappy happenings have left you in charge of that branch of the business.

6000|$|... "I think, Inspector," [...] Holmes remarked, [...] "that {{you would}} do well to {{telegraph}} for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county jail. The boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. If there is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> well to take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish, and this investigation draws rapidly to a close." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{let me go}} on for a moment, Mr. Spicer, till I {{make this}} thing clear to Sir Thomas. That's how we stand at present. It will cost us,--that is to say you,--about £1,500, and we should do no good. I really don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> any good. Here are these judges, and you know that new brooms sweep clean. I suppose we may allow that there was a little money spent somewhere. They do say now that a glass of beer would lose a seat." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Very candidly, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> made a mistake. Because {{we thought}} about adding Missouri and Kansas at the time. There was {{not a great deal}} of enthusiasm about that. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>done</b> that at the time. So we would have had Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and then moved into that other area. I think, by the way, that that can still happen." ...|$|R

"You and I, at any rate, Maggie, {{know the}} truth," [...] he said, [...] "and {{so long as}} we can get no help from the proper quarters, I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> better to let the matter remain as it is. We don't want to direct people's {{attention}} to us. We want to lull suspicion so far as we can, to be free to watch the three." ...|$|R

5000|$|A couple (Frost & MacNeill) {{participate}} in some sexual roleplay, {{with the woman}} wearing a different kinky uniform in each sketch. Sadly for him, the woman takes her roleplaying all too seriously (e.g. during a nurse roleplay she informs him that he has cancer), which leads the man to conclude [...] "Jenny, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> roleplay any more." ...|$|E

They criticised proposed plans for a BBC Comic Relief-style day of programmes around climate change. Horrocks was quoted as saying: [...] "I absolutely don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> that because it's not impartial. It's not our job to lead people and proselytise about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Polis {{has been}} an early critic of the War on Drugs, stating that [...] "Just as the policy of {{prohibition}} failed nationally with alcohol - it's now up to states and counties - I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> the same with marijuana." [...] During a June 2012 testimony of DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations, Polis questioned whether marijuana should be classified as a schedule one drug. Polis questioned Leonhart, who refused to answer whether or not cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin posed a greater risk to someone's health than marijuana. Polis also advocated the legalization of medical marijuana to combat prescription drug abuse.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first time}} when Muse began to speak about this album was in September 2015. According to Dom, they were {{discussing}} the direction for the new album and that this album must be really {{different from the other}} releases. Dom also said: «I think it's time to kind of lose our minds a little bit more in the studio and delve into some new areas of music that we're kind of not that used to or comfortable with. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> definitely <b>do</b> that and kinda go for it. Yeah, we've got small ideas about how <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can evolve.

Eliminating a {{great deal}} of the marvelous with which we seem to have come in touch here, it is still obvious that we find ourselves in very peculiar and unhealthy surroundings. I mean mentally unhealthy, indeed I <b>think</b> that if <b>we</b> stay here much longer we shall probably go off our heads. Now that boat on the deck remains sound and seaworthy.

5000|$|What {{came over}} me was not an accident. It was planned. I set out with a {{definite}} plan in mind, to try to force the action, force something to happen, so that the researchers would have something to work with. After all, what could they possibly learn from guys sitting around {{like it was a}} country club? So I consciously created this persona. I was in all kinds of drama productions in high school and college. It was something I was very familiar with: to take on another personality before you step out on the stage. I was kind of running my own experiment in there, by saying, [...] "How far can I push these things and how much abuse will these people take before they say, 'knock it off?'" [...] But the other guards didn't stop me. They seemed to join in. They were taking my lead. Not a single guard said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> this."

40|$|How do real {{individuals}} {{live together}} in real societies in the real world? Jeffrey Alexander's masterful work, The Civil Sphere, addresses this central paradox of modern life. Feelings for others—the solidarity that is ignored or underplayed by theories of power or self-interest—are {{at the heart of}} this novel inquiry into the meeting place between normative theories of what we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> and empirical studies of who we actually are.

60|$|Of course, however, {{we might}} come thither without accident, {{travelling}} with good guides {{on a dark}} night, for, after all, the place was big, and the road lonely and little used, so that unless we met a watch, which, we were told, would not be there, our little caravan had {{a good chance to}} pass unobserved. Shadrach seemed to <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> so, but the worst of it was that, like Quick, I did not trust Shadrach. Even Maqueda, the Lady of the Abati, she whom they called Child of Kings, had her doubts about him, or so it had seemed to me.|$|R

5000|$|In October 2007, a {{laser beam}} {{installed}} on the tower {{for the duration of}} the annual Illuminations was criticised by Astronomer and presenter of The Sky at Night television programme, Patrick Moore who said, [...] "Light pollution is a huge problem. I am not saying <b>we</b> <b>should</b> turn all the lights out, that is not practical, but there are some things which are very unnecessary. The Blackpool Tower light is certainly something I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>doing.</b> I very much oppose it." [...] The beam could be seen 30 miles away. Moore called for the beam to be stopped. The Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston said the laser has added to a spiraling problem affecting astronomy.|$|R
40|$|The {{biggest problem}} with the {{criminal}} justice system is that too many crimes are committed-too many rapes, too many murders, too many robberies; too much violence that inflicts an untold amount of suffering and destruction on too many people. If that seems obvious, what follows should be equally obvious. The most important step to take to solve the problems of {{the criminal justice system}} is to reduce the number of crimes that are committed: to prevent crimes. The best thing we can do to help the victims of crime is to keep them from becoming victims in the first place. Chief Reuben Greenberg is doing an admirable job of that in his own city 2 ̆ 7 -many of his reforms have been adopted by other police departments-but overall, crime prevention has not been a high priority. In general, we don 2 ̆ 7 t half try. What do I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> that we 2 ̆ 7 re not doing? I 2 ̆ 7 m not talking about some liberal, big-government, tax-and-spend programs-such as a Job Corps that really reduces unemployment, or a program for rebuilding destroyed inner cities. These might be good ideas, but I 2 ̆ 7 m talking about something simple and basic: policing...|$|E

I went on blindly, without {{thinking}} much about the path one way or the other; the thing that worried me most was that either Hawtrey or Fortescue might give out, and I could not <b>think</b> what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> then. They stumbled very often, and I kept expecting to hear a fall. By the pace the guides went at I felt sure that we could carry the women down, and I thought that the warmth of our bodies would keep life in them; but if Hawtrey or Fortescue fell, I did not see what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> could not leave him there to die, and yet to stop would have been death to all of us.

Well, I have come here this afternoon to tell you that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it right that the working classes should be asked to pay a share towards the conduct of a democratic State. And <b>we</b> <b>think</b> that taxes on luxuries, however widely consumed, are a proper channel for such payment to be made. We believe that the working classes are able to pay by that channel, and we believe, further, that they are ready to pay. <b>We</b> do not <b>think</b> that in this old, wise country they would have respected any Government which {{at a time like this}} had feared to go to them for their share.|$|R

Many employers have organized Team Building activities for their staff and then later questioned the value when things didn't seem to change in the workplace. We need to change our perception of Team Building. "It's not just about the beers!" It is good to have fun, but results are just as important. Team Building is about ongoing, focused, planned, outcome driven behaviour that should in some form happen daily.

30|$|When {{we review}} the {{historical}} {{process of the}} development of a society, we must pay attention to multiple aspects: the macro-aspect of the general direction of its historical development and the micro-aspect of all kinds of detailed specific issues taking place at the present time. Of the two, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> first make sure of the former, recognizing the general orientation of the history before <b>we</b> <b>think</b> about what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> in dealing with detailed events today. A person must know where to go when she or he is walking. After a careful analysis of the Soviet Union that composed of many units and finally collapsed in the 1990 s, and a study of the United States whose racial tensions are generally improved since the Civil Right movement in the 1960 s, I suggest to a de-politicization of the ethnic/minzu issues in China and a rethinking of the historic orientation of the Chinese nation in the long run.As a country of 1.3 billion people, it is impossible to develop without long foresight and related strategic design.|$|R

In a Chicago Sun-Times interview in 2003, Keaton expressed her readiness to appear in a second film. A year later, writer Paul Rudnick reportedly started writing a draft, entitled Avon Ladies of the Amazon, and in 2005, Midler confirmed to USA Today that there was indeed a manuscript but that [...] "the strike kept it from happening."

40|$|As with {{clinical}} practice, {{the practice of}} biomedical research is a moral activity. <b>We</b> have to <b>think</b> about what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do,</b> not just about what we can do, to modify life. We {{would do well to}} remember what Peter Medawar called the ‘limits of scientific discovery’. 1, 2 Also, there are distinct limits to the present understanding of the boundary zone between living things and non-living things, although some researchers are unaware of these limits. Actually, some researchers may be as misled by the media-generated hyperbole (‘hype’) as the general public. I believe this is particularly true of the people who work at the interface between experimental biology and industry—the sphere called biotechnology, which includes bioengineering and genetic engineering. Why is this? Chiefly because non-clinical biotechnologists do not see the failures of intervention in living patients; physicians do. 3 The experience of physicians is a crucial counterweight to the unbridled enthusiasm of scientists. As Karl Popper stated, “It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience [...] . not the verifiability but the falsifiability of a [scientific] system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation”. 4 Why do We Need Research Ethics? Designing and implementing an experimental study often requires us both to ask factual questions (“How does this disease arise? Does this drug produce a clinically important effect?”) and to make value judgements (“This intervention is likely to alter the natural course of this type of stomach cancer”, or “The unwanted effects of treatment are so severe tha...|$|R
