Several critics contend that the portrayal of women, especially Arwen, in the films is thematically faithful to (or compatible with) Tolkien's writings despite some differences.|$|E
5|$|Brisco was {{developed}} by Boam and Cuse {{at the request of}} Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> style of vintage movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. Brisco {{was one of the last}} television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His voice had a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E

She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks an exciting conversion narrative; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, his reign only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much amelioration of the Christians' condition. In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> content of his account.|$|E

5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, {{but given the}} delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, {{it is impossible to}} do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cast changes, <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> pacing of the films was also matured and altered for comic effect. The films changed the petty crimes of the books into gruesome murders, that are often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At {{the time of the}} films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend usually duped into another scheme. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults, Nancy in the films was often chastised by adults for her habit to go into mysteries, and she often found herself at odds with her father and the police.|$|E

5|$|The Turn of the Screw (also {{known as}} Ghost Story: The Turn of the Screw) is a British {{television}} film based on Henry James's 1898 ghost {{story of the}} same name. Commissioned and produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009, on BBC One. The novella was adapted for the screen by Sandy Welch, and the film was directed by Tim Fywell. Although generally true to <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> story of James's work, the film {{is set in the}} 1920s—in contrast to the original 1840s setting—and accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella. The film's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the institutionalised Ann (Michelle Dockery) and Dr Fisher (Dan Stevens). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (Mark Umbers) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (Eva Sayer). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (Sue Johnston), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thirteen}} Harry Potter video games, eight corresponding {{with the}} films and books and five spin-offs. The film/book-based games {{are produced by}} Electronic Arts, as was , with the game version of the first entry in the series, Philosopher's Stone, being released in November 2001. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone {{went on to become}} one of the best-selling PlayStation games ever. The video games were released to coincide with the films, containing scenery and details from the films as well as <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>and</b> spirit of the books. Objectives usually occur in and around Hogwarts, along with various other magical areas. The story and design of the games follow the selected film's characterisation and plot; EA worked closely with Warner Bros. to include scenes from the films. The last game in the series, Deathly Hallows, was split, with Part 1 released in November 2010 and Part 2 debuting on consoles in July 2011. The two-part game forms the first entry to convey an intense theme of action and violence, with the gameplay revolving around a third-person shooter style format.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the new canal were marred by legal {{disputes}} with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to the Tone at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the Canal Company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that they were taking over <b>the</b> <b>Tone,</b> <b>and</b> evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King's Bench that their action was illegal, the Canal Company held on to the river until a High Court judgement in February 1830. The Conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which they removed after further legal action and an Order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new Act of Parliament to authorise the sale of the Tone Navigation to the Canal Company. This was obtained in July 1832, and required the Canal Company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the wharfs in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the Conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.|$|E
