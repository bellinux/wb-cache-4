5000|$|In 1963 (or in 1964), {{the first}} Adidas <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> was produced, {{which was the}} first ever leather <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> and marked the {{beginning}} of a long line of classic Adidas shoes. The upper part of the shoe is made of white leather, whereas the pimpled outer sole is made of rubber. The inner sole is made of synthetic material. It was Horst Dassler, the son of Adolf [...] "Adi" [...] Dassler - the founder of Adidas, who had the idea of the first leather <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe.</b> In 1965, this <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> model was named the [...] "adidas Robert Haillet" [...] after the French tennis professional Robert Haillet. When Haillet retired from tennis, Adidas and Horst Dassler decided to find another tennis player that could endorse the <b>tennis</b> <b>shoe</b> model. Donald Dell, an American tennis manager, suggested Stan Smith, who took the offer in order to obtain royalties for the use of his name. For Adidas, the shoe became a market opener in the United States. In 1967, a green foam padding was added {{at the back of the}} shoe for Achilles tendon protection.|$|R

500|$|Antonio Ezequiel Cárdenas Guillén {{was born}} on 5 March 1962 in El Mezquital ranch in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. As a teenager, Antonio Ezequiel and his brother Osiel earned their living by washing cars at the {{headquarters}} of the Federal Judicial Police in their hometown. By the late 1980s, Cárdenas Guillén started his criminal career under the Gulf Cartel, where he became a high-ranking leader and commanded organized crime activities and drug trafficking in Matamoros. His contact with the police in Matamoros marked the life of the Cárdenas Guillén clan; federal reports of the Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) suggest that the drug lord had solid business relations with police and military men. Witnesses indicate that Antonio frequented public places in Matamoros, Reynosa, Ciudad Victoria, and other cities in the state of Tamaulipas surrounded by a number of municipal and state police officers, whose superiors have allegedly remained loyal to the Gulf Cartel for over half a century. His henchmen reportedly wore bullet-proof vests with the Spanish insignias for the Gulf Cartel (Cártel del Golfo – C.D.G.) embellished across their chests. Although some of Antonio Ezequiel's men were reported to have worn military garbs while on duty, their uniforms have also become more subtle with time. For example, some Gulf Cartel gunmen wear <b>tennis</b> <b>shoes</b> of the same color, caps with the logo [...] "CDG–TT" [...] (Gulf Cartel–Tony Tormenta), or trucks emblazoned with the same logo to help them distinguish themselves from rival gangs.|$|E

500|$|Time magazine, {{music critic}} Robert Christgau and AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine all {{declared}} the track {{as one of}} CrazySexyCool best. [...] "In many ways, TLC at least musically, were best when {{they were the most}} subtle," [...] commented Complex Michael Arceneaux. In addition, the writer also found the track's content to be [...] "refreshing" [...] for displaying women [...] "muddy up right and wrong in a relationship." [...] From the same publication, Benjamin Chesna and Edwin Ortiz gave credits to the song for making infidelity sound [...] "empowering" [...] while praising Austin's [...] "silky smooth production," [...] concluding their article with a claim: [...] " [...] forced you into the arms of another lady, now you just have to keep it on the down low." [...] Slant Magazines editor Sal Cinquemani was reviewing the greatest hits album 20 when he observed that both of the girls' [...] "finest" [...] singles, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", had them [...] "proudly flipping accepted modes of female sexual behavior and consent on their heads." [...] To boot the idea, Idolator journalist Robbie Daw explained the song's [...] "staying power" [...] was perhaps owed {{to the fact that it}} was a [...] "provocative" [...] track dared to expose the [...] "taboo, down-low" [...] aspects of a relationship. In the 2014 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, [...] "Creep" [...] was served as the backdrop to a dramatic scene where Lopes' character set her then-boyfriend Rison's bathtub filled with <b>tennis</b> <b>shoes</b> on fire and destroyed their joint mansion due to his infidelity. Vibe Clover Hope watched the whole scene and realized how [...] "perfectly sexy and unapologetic" [...] the song was at the time of its first releasing. In contrary, one of Pitchfork contributors, Jess Harvell, felt its lyrics were [...] "unconscionable," [...] instead, he praised the song's groove that was [...] "so seductive you barely register what you're singing along to." [...] Harvell continued to say that Austin even managed to make scratching, [...] "that emblem of noisy hip-hop ruckus", sound [...] "smooth." [...] "No mean feat.," [...] he gave out an endnote. With Charles Aaron's review for Spin, he fictionalized a short story:After that, Aaron also went on to call the track as a whole a [...] "commercial/artistic apex" [...] for the producer. Including it on her list of best tracks that make people dance, Bernadette McNulty from The Telegraph claimed: [...] "The Dallas Austin groove on this is so deep, it might give you vertigo." [...] Ebony writer Michael A. Gonzales agreed, he said the girls' song [...] "put the sonic scientist that much closer to [...] dreams of making tracks as enticing and sexy as the ones his hero Prince created for Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6." [...] Music critic Smokey Fontaine even named the track Austin's best work: [...] "Here, the harmonies worked, the bass line was hard enough to compete in a hip-hop world, and for a moment, R didn't need a guest rapper." ...|$|E
