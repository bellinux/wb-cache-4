I read somewhere that every inch of rope used in the British Navy has a strand of red in it, so that {{wherever}} a bit of it is found it is known. That is the text of my little sermon to you. Virtue, which means honour, honesty, courage, and all that makes character, is the red thread that marks a good man wherever he is. Keep that always and everywhere, so that even if wrecked by misfortune, that sign shall still be found and recognized. Yours is a rough life, and your mates not all we could wish, but you can be a gentleman in the true sense of the word; and no matter what happens <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> keep your soul clean, your heart true to those who love you, and do your duty to the end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It is true, there {{embarked}} {{with him}} in the same galley, Emanuel Moralez, and Alphonso de Castro; but it was only that the Father might carry them to Malacca, from whence both of them were to be transported to the Moluccas. The ship, which attended the Father at Cochin, being just ready to set sail they made but a short stay in that place, but it was not unprofitable. The saint walking one day through the streets, happened to meet a Portuguese of his acquaintance; and immediately asked him, [...] "how he was in health?" [...] The Portuguese answered, [...] "he was very well." [...] "Yes," [...] replied Xavier, [...] "in relation <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> but, in regard of your soul, no man can be in a worse condition." [...] This man, who was then designing in his heart a wicked action, knew immediately that the Father saw into the bottom of it; and seriously reflecting on it, followed Xavier, confessed himself, and changed his evil life. The preaching of Castro so charmed the people, that they desired to have retained him at Cochin, there to have established the college of the Society; but Xavier who had designed him for the Moluccas opposed it. And Providence, which destined the crown of martyrdom to that missioner, suffered him not to continue in a place, where they had nothing but veneration for him.|$|E

6000|$|This is {{all true}} enough; {{but there is}} a sound and true answer to it. It is not so much more TIME which you are asked to give up to your souls in Lent, as it is more HEART. What do I talk of? GIVING UP more time to your souls? And yet {{this is the way we}} all talk, as if our time belonged to our bodies, and so we had to rob them of it, to give it up to our souls,--as if our bodies were ourselves, and our souls were {{troublesome}} burdens, or peevish children hanging at our backs, which would keep prating and fretting about heaven and hell, and had to be quieted, and their mouths stopped as quickly and easily as possible, that we might be rid of them, and get about our true business, our real duty,--this mighty work of eating and drinking, and amusing ourselves, and making money. I am afraid-- afraid there are too many, who, if they spoke out their whole hearts, would be quite as content to have no souls, and no necessity to waste their precious time (as they think) upon religion. But, my friends, my friends, the day will come when you will see yourselves in a true light; when your soul will not seem a mere hanger-on <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> but you will find out THAT YOU ARE YOUR SOUL. Then there will be no more forgetting that you have souls, and thrusting them into the background, to be fed at odd minutes, or left to starve,-- no more talk of GIVING UP time to the care of your souls; your souls will take the time for themselves then--and the eternity, too; they will be all in all to you then, perhaps when it is too late! ...|$|E

50|$|Exercising and dieting {{is often}} seen {{as the best way}} to achieve such ideal body image. For instance, fitness {{publications}} promote an idea that doing physical exercise is the natural medicine <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> and health. On the other hand, fashion magazines promote slimness and thinness as the ideal female image: to promote high fashion, models are usually slim and thin. There is also a significant increase of diet and weight loss articles in magazines. In addition, the shape of models has changed dramatically towards a “more tubular female form” in high fashion culture, often sparking controversies.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{way to maintain}} your personal health {{is to have a}} healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>body.</b> Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e. blood pressure). The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e. Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, and Sugars). Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of cancer, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.|$|E

Tirukkuṛaḷ states in verses 943 through 945, “eat in moderation, when you feel hungry, foods that are agreeable <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> refraining from foods that your body finds disagreeable”. Tiruvalluvar also emphasizes overeating has ill effects on health, in verse 946, as “the pleasures of health abide in the man who eats moderately. The pains of disease dwell with him who eats excessively.” ...|$|E
