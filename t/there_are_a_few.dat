5|$|However, if {{they were}} common, more than the {{occasional}} specimen might be expected in exceptionally preserved fossil assemblages (Konservat-Lagerstätten) such as the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Pleistocene (2.6million to 12,000years BP) {{records from}} Europe of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct Regulus is a left ulna from 2.6–1.95mya in Bulgaria, which was {{identified}} as belonging to an extinct species, Regulus bulgaricus. The goldcrest lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common firecrest in the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers {{are not necessarily}} mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but {{simply because they are}} omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In {{the quality of their}} milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the fossil record of insects is scant, including beetles from the Lower Triassic. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> exceptions, such as in Eastern Europe. At the Babiy Kamen site in the Kuznetsk Basin, numerous beetle fossils were discovered, including entire specimens of the infraorders Archostemata (e.g. Ademosynidae, Schizocoleidae), Adephaga (e.g., Triaplidae, Trachypachidae) and Polyphaga (e.g. Hydrophilidae, Byrrhidae, Elateroidea). However, species from the families Cupedidae and Schizophoroidae are not present at this site, whereas they dominate at other fossil sites from the Lower Triassic. Further records are known from Khey-Yaga, Russia, in the Korotaikha Basin.|$|E
