5|$|A {{secondary}} {{division of}} the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after which all the earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without the account of <b>the</b> <b>gloomy</b> court of Heorot, or of {{the contrast between the}} young Beowulf and the old Hrothgar.|$|E
5|$|Waugh {{began at}} Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became {{bored with the}} routine and quickly {{abandoned}} his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, The Temple at Thatch, intending {{to work on it}} in his spare time. Despite <b>the</b> <b>gloomy</b> ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.|$|E
5|$|After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is {{compelled}} {{to leave his}} apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg, contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His fascination for the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him to contrive further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. <b>The</b> <b>gloomy</b> Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Liebling and Geof O’Keefe {{decided to}} leave their {{previous}} bands (Shades of Darkness and Space Meat, respectively) {{to form a new}} band that reflected their interest in emerging metal acts such as UFO, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Sir Lord Baltimore. At Liebling’s suggestion, the group was named Pentagram, a name that reflected <b>the</b> <b>gloomy</b> subject matter of their material. Although the band would change its name several times during 1971 and 1972 (Virgin Death, Macabre, and Wicked Angel were all considered during this period), they would eventually (and permanently) return to Pentagram. Contrary to popular belief, they were never called Stonebunny; this was the name given to Space Meat when Bobby Liebling joined them briefly.|$|E

Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is convinced {{she is as}} beautiful and in demand as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding her from the realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe of her plan {{to return to the}} screen with Salome, a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress. Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer of work as editor on the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on Salome.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gloomy</b> {{situation}} {{changed when}} first Syracuse and then Rome {{came to the}} aid of Carthage. Syracuse redoubled the volume of supplies sent to Carthage. Rome forbade Italian traders to trade with rebels and encouraged trade with Carthage, freed Punic prisoners without ransom, and allowed Carthage to recruit mercenaries from Roman territories and flatly refused the invitation from Utica, Hippo and Sardinia to occupy these areas. Finally, when the Carthaginian Senate was unable to decide between Hamilcar and Hanno, the people's assembly left it to the army to decide on their Commander in Chief, and Hamilcar Barca was elected to sole command. The people’s assembly chose Hannibal of Paropos, son of another Hamilcar and a veteran of the First Punic War as Hamilcar’s deputy.|$|E

500|$|... "O'er <b>the</b> <b>Gloomy</b> Hills of Darkness" [...] first {{appeared}} in published hymnals in 1792. Jeffrey Richards states that [...] "William Williams's O'er <b>the</b> <b>Gloomy</b> Hills of Darkness of 1772 (sung variously to Thomas Clark's Calcutta, by Baptists; to [...] Henry Gauntlett's Triumph, in The Scottish Hymnal; to Edwin Moss's Ulpha, in the 1982 Presbyterian Church Praise) {{did not make it}} into Hymns Ancient and Modern, but it was in Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody in 1833 and was still to be found complete in the 1933 Baptist Hymnal … This very much set the tone for missionary hymns." [...] After being published in 374 hymnals throughout history, in the 1960s the hymn stopped being published in all Christian hymnals. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints retained the hymn in their hymnals from 1927 until dropping it in 1985. This was because its members in modern times felt that the hymn connected Native Americans and black people with barbarians.|$|E
500|$|... "Metzengerstein" [...] follows many {{conventions}} of Gothic fiction and, to some, exaggerates those conventions. Consequently, critics and scholars debate if Poe intended {{the story to}} be taken seriously or considered a satire of Gothic stories. Regardless, many elements introduced in [...] "Metzengerstein" [...] would become common in Poe's future writing, including <b>the</b> <b>gloomy</b> castle and the power of evil. Because the story follows an orphan raised in an aristocratic household, some critics suggest an autobiographical connection with its author.|$|E
500|$|This allure [...] {{tragedy and}} untamed nature [...] was a {{powerful}} draw for the early artists who painted in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

500|$|Janusz Andrzej Zajdel (15 August 1938 [...] 19 July 1985) was a [...] Polish {{science fiction}} author, second in {{popularity}} in Poland to Stanisław Lem.

500|$|... "O'er <b>the</b> <b>Gloomy</b> Hills of Darkness", also titled [...] "O'er Those Gloomy Hills of Darkness", is a Welsh Christian hymn by William Williams Pantycelyn {{written in}} 1772.

The hymn was later published in 374 hymnals worldwide, though it was censored and altered in the United States by slaveholders for evangelising to slaves. The hymn later fell out of favour with hymn book editors in the 1960s.|$|E
