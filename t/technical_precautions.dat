40|$|SummaryIatrogenic {{vascular}} {{injuries are}} uncommon {{during the course}} of proximal femur surgical procedures. We report the case of an 85 -year-old female presenting with an intertrochanteric fracture, treated by anterograde (cephalocondylic) intramedullary nailing (Stryker gamma 3 ™ nail) and complicated by a superficial femoral artery laceration {{at the level of the}} distal locking screw. Lower limb traction in adduction and internal rotation on the operating table might put at risk the superficial femoral artery during distal screw drilling and insertion. We therefore recommend returning to the neutral position and reducing lower extremity traction after femoral head screw placing and before final distal screw insertion. This <b>technical</b> <b>precaution</b> should limit the risk of superficial femoral artery injury associated with short-nail anterograde intramedullary nailing.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Lithiasis during {{pregnancy}} {{can be a}} serious problem representing a danger to both {{the mother and the}} fetus. Surgical intervention is needed in approximately one-third of patients reporting pain despite analgesia and/or signs of persistent infection and obstruction, but {{there is a lack of}} consensus in the scientific literature as to the use of the most appropriate procedure to treat this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe our experience in the treatment of a complicated reno-ureteral lithiasis in a 27 -year-old patient in the first trimester of pregnancy. The patient had a calcified ureteral stent with associated stone formation in the right kidney and a bladder stone at the distal extremity of the stent. She was treated by a combined approach by percutaneous nephrolithotripsy and transurethral cystolithotripsy. The procedure we performed was effective. CONCLUSION: Our experience reinforces the feasibility and safety of the kidney stone removal by the percutaneous approach also in a pregnant patient and supports the recommendations of the European guidelines: "in experienced centers, where necessary, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy should be considered. " The <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> taken have proven to be valid and are supported by the current literature. Therefore, we feel they can be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{flow through}} aortocoronary venous grafts and its {{response}} to {{a brief period of}} arterial occlusion [...] reactive hyperaemia [...] were studied in relation to the development of postoperative myocardial infarction. In 40 patients with intractable angina due to obstructive coronary artery disease, 72 aortocoronary venous grafts were constructed. In 18 % of the grafts there was no response to the flow to temporary occlusion, due to absence of reactive hyperaemia. In the remaining grafts the flow increased from 17 % to 26 %. In 17 - 5 % of the patients postoperative myocardial infarction was diagnosed. No relation could be established between this control flow through aortocoronary grafts and postoperative myocardial infarction. A significant difference was found in the magnitude of the reactive hyperaemia following occlusion of the graft between patients who developed myocardial infarction (13 - 0 %) {{and those who did not}} (26 - 8 %). Some of our observations suggest that the myocardium is in a state of reactive hyperaemia after coronary surgery. With certain <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> the flow changes caused by reactive hyperaemia can be used as an indicator of the result to be expected from bypass surgery...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Surface {{electromyography}} {{has been}} used to assess the extrinsic laryngeal muscles during chewing and swallowing, but there have been few studies assessing these muscles during phonation. Objective: To investigate the current state of knowledge regarding the use of surface electromyography for evaluation of the electrical activity of the extrinsic muscles of the larynx during phonation by means of an integrative review. Method: We searched for articles and other papers in the PubMed, Medline/Bireme, and Scielo databases that were published between 1980 and 2012, by using the following descriptors: surface electromyography and voice, surface electromyography and phonation, and surface electromyography and dysphonia. The articles were selectedon the basis ofinclusion and exclusion criteria. Data Synthesis: This was carried out with a cross critical matrix. We selected 27 papers,i. e., 24 articles and 3 theses. The studies differed methodologically with regards to sample size and investigation techniques, making it difficult to compare them, but showed differences in electrical activity between the studied groups (dysphonicsubjects, non-dysphonicsubjects, singers, and others). Conclusion: Electromyography has clinical applicability when <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> with respect to application and analysis are obeyed.

40|$|Objectives: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of evaluating applied occupational health teaching for final-year medical stu-dents at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine. Methods: The study included all sixth grade medical students (n= 293) during one academic year. Pre- and post-training tests were used to assess the magnitude of change in knowledge and attitude of students on occupational health, whereas the opinion of students on several aspects of the quality of teaching sessions were assessed by using post-training questionnaires. Results: Post-training tests revealed that the level of knowledge on all aspects of occupational health increased among medi-cal students. An evaluation of the teaching sessions showed favorable results for the overall quality of the sessions: 81. 3 % of the students stated that the sessions were well organized, 81. 7 % remarked the workplace/factory visit was a valuable experience, and 91. 0 % stated feeling more competent on occupational health issues. Conclusion: There was a greater increase in students ’ knowledge on <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> than their knowledge on issues related to medical practice in the workplace. Visiting a workplace was found to contribute to the overall aim of knowledge and attitude change on occupational health issues.

It is essential to get individuals adopt the habit of using the internet according to ethical rules since their primary education school ages in terms of preventing related problems in society. The general {{aim of this study}} is to determine the unethical internet usage behaviors of primary students in terms of various variables. The study group of this descriptive research consists of 6, 7 and 8 th grade students (n= 1761) attending various primary education schools. The data collection instrument developed by the researchers contains items about demographic characteristics and unethical behaviors. Frequency (f), percentage (%) and Chi-square (X 2) test of independence were used in data analyses. Research findings revealed that the gender, the duration of internet usage and the situation of connecting the internet in a cafe are affecting almost all unethical behaviors which are exhibited and exposed. Accordingly the following suggestions were made; students, families and teachers should be informed about using the internet considering ethical rules; students’ duration and places of internet usage and internet activities should be controlled by their parents; related legal and <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> should be taken; studies should be carried out in order to improve the internet cafes and investigate the causes of unethical internet behaviors among primary education school students...|$|E

40|$|Endocavitary {{electrocardiography}} {{was used}} during surgery on the posterior fossa and the cervical spine in semi sitting {{position as a}} check when placing a ventriculo atrial shunt while inserting an intracardiac catheter in hydrocephaly. The method was as follows: one of the metal electrodes usually employed in cardiology, {{was replaced by a}} water column by filling the catheter with a 20 % saline solution. The catheter, which is inserted via a wide vein (e. g. the internal jugular vein) was pushed upwards cm by cm until in the superior vena cava and further mm by mm until in the right atrium. The patient was connected with the 4 electrodes of an electrocardioscope; subsequently, at the ECG recording, either the electrodes for the left arm, or the thoracic electrodes were connected with the metal extension piece of the syringe containing the 20 % saline solution and attached to the endocavitary catheter. The morphological changes in the auriculogram, that could be followed on the electrocardioscope, allowed the determination of the exact localization of the catheter in the atrium at any moment during the moving of the catheter. Reading the auriculogram was simple, provided that some <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> were observed. The only obstacle in this method was formed by the patients having atrial fibrillation. The authors have abandoned the radiological control method in favour of the electrocardiographic control method, which, in their opinion, is the simplest, most correct and rapid method.

40|$|Paternity {{testing in}} Italy is usually {{performed}} by private laboratories and universities having direct {{contacts with the}} applicants. Recently, the number of paternity tests offered through laboratory websites has increased in Italy and Europe. The execution of genetic tests, including paternity testing based on DNA analysis, represents a complex act, which contains three main steps. Paternity analyses carried out by laboratories via Internet are performed on samples collected by the applicants and then mailed back to the laboratories without any patient– physician relationship. Information {{is given to the}} subjects through the laboratory’s website or mailed with the test order form. The execution of ‘‘household’’ DNA analysis without <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> may provide an incorrect response with severe consequences on the individual who has undergone testing, on the family involved, and on society in general. The problems connected with this kind of analysis are not technical, but ethical and deontological. In this work, we will discuss the problems related to information and consent by way of outlining the relevant Italian laws and codes of medical ethics. The Italian Privacy’s Guarantor is assessing the ethical and legal implications, but regulations are not yet in place. We believe that adequate information related to this practice cannot be given via Internet, and, consequently, the validity of the consent expressed during this kind of procedure can be uncertain. Further, we will analyze issues regarding the importance ofminors’ protection when a paternity test is performed via Internet. In our opinion, the complexity of the situations and expectations linked to paternity investigations require a special sensitivity in dealing with each case, based on a patient–physician relationship in the decision-making process especially referring to the defense of the minors’ well-being...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To propose uterine myoma {{embolization}} as {{an alternative}} to myomectomy or hysterectomy in the treatment of symptomatic myomas; to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure in terms of clinical outcome, adopting all procedural and <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> to ensure minimal X-ray exposure and preserve reproductive potential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April 1998 and February 2000, 26 patients, age range 32 - 54 years (mean 41 years), underwent uterine arterial embolization for menorrhagia, pelvic pain, and sensation of mass and pressure. Inclusion criteria were: single myomas, intramural localization and rich vascolarization of the lesion. Dose to patient was obtained by placing a thermoluminescent dosimeter (Harshaw, Solon, Ohio) both placed in posterior fornix of the vagina and on the skin at the beam entrance site. The procedure was performed under peridural anesthesia; polyvinil alcohol particles 355 - 500 mu (Contour) (Target Therapeutics, Boston Scientific Corporation, Fremont CA, USA) were employed as embolic agent. The uterine arteries were incannulated with a 5 F (Glidecath, Terumo, Europe NV, Belgium) and successively 3 F coaxial microcatheter (Target, Boston Scientific Corporation, Fremont CA, USA); the embolic material was injected as distally as possible. Color Power Doppler Ultrasound follow-up before and after i. v. contrast media administration (Levovist SHU 508 A, Shering, Berlin, Germany) was carried out at 15 days, at 1, at 3, at 6 months, and at 1 year from embolization. Pre-procedural evaluation and follow-up at 1 year was performed by MRI using T 1 and T 2 weighted images before and after Gadolinium (GdDTPA Shering, Berlin, Germany) administration. RESULTS: The technical success of the interventional procedure was 100 % (26 / 26 cases). The mean fluoroscopy time was 20 minutes, and the mean number of angiographic exposures was 10. The mean estimated ovarian dose was 18. 75 cGy and the mean adsorbed skin dose was 126. 71 cGy. The imaging follow-up showed a 55 % reduction of myoma volume at 6 months and a 75 % reduction at 1 year. All patients reported a marked decrease in symptoms. No major complications were observed. The appearance of pelvic pain in the 24 - 48 hours after the procedure required sedation by analgesic pump; transitorial amenorrhea was observed in 3 patients. As for term complications, 2 patients have eliminated necrotic material through the vagina four weeks after procedure. The patients reported great satisfaction with the procedure. DISCUSSION: Many treatment options are currently available for symptomatic uterine myomas. One is surgical myomectomy which is associated with increased blood loss, pain and post operative morbidity and requires an additional surgical procedure for fibroma recurrence in 20 - 25 % of patients. Another alternative treatment is hormonal therapy, which drammatically improves symptoms and reduces fibroid size although leiomyomas regrow to their original size within a few months of discontinuing treatment. Uterine embolization is a relatively new treatment for uterine fibroids that can be considered {{as an alternative}} to surgical and medical procedures. The radiation exposure adsorbed by the patient is reduced by using pulsed fluoroscopy and taking all the precautionary measures required to minimize the dose. CONCLUSIONS: The technical success, the patient' satisfation, the short hospitalization time and preservation of fertility confer to uterine artery embolization the role of a new alternative therapy for the treatment of symptomatic uterine myomas...|$|E
40|$|Objective Biomonitoring of {{solvents}} {{using the}} unchanged substance in urine as exposure indicator is still relatively scarce due to some discrepancies between the results {{reported in the}} literature. Based on the assessment of toluene exposure, {{the aim of this}} work was to evaluate the effects of some steps likely to bias the results and to measure urinary toluene both in volunteers experimentally exposed and in workers of rotogravure factories. Methods Static headspace was used for toluene analysis. o-Cresol was also measured for comparison. Urine collection, storage and conservation conditions were studied to evaluate possible loss or contamination of toluene in controlled situations applied to six volunteers in an exposure chamber according to four scenarios with exposure at stable levels from 10 to 50 ppm. Kinetics of elimination of toluene were determined over 24 h. A field study was then carried out in a total of 29 workers from two rotogravure printing facilities. Results Potential contamination during urine collection in the field is confirmed to be a real problem but <b>technical</b> <b>precautions</b> for sampling, storage and analysis can be easily followed to control the situation. In the volunteers at rest, urinary toluene showed a rapid increase after 2 h with a steady level after about 3 h. At 47. 1 ppm the mean cumulated excretion was about 0. 005 % of the amount of the toluene ventilated. Correlation between the toluene levels in air and in end of exposure urinary sample was excellent (r = 0. 965). In the field study, the median personal exposure to toluene was 32 ppm (range 3. 6 - 148). According to the correlations between environmental and biological monitoring data, the post-shift urinary toluene (r = 0. 921) and o-cresol (r = 0. 873) concentrations were, respectively, 75. 6 mu g/l and 0. 76 mg/g creatinine for 50 ppm toluene personal exposure. The corresponding urinary toluene concentration before the next shift was 11 mu g/l (r = 0. 883). Conclusion Urinary toluene was shown once more time a very interesting surrogate to o-cresol and could be recommended as a biomarker of choice for solvent exposure.

Pytela, R. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 1991 - 08 American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology 52170 - 7 <![CDATA[The integrins are a large group of cell surface glycoproteins that mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesive interactions. Integrins play a role in normal lung development, in host defense against pulmonary infection, and in the pathogenesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Integrins are heterodimers consisting of one alpha subunit and one beta subunit. We identified consensus sequences within integrin subunits and used oligonucleotide primers based on these sequences to amplify cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We previously reported the use of this homology PCR technique for the identification of one novel integrin beta subunit, beta 6, from guinea pig airway epithelial cells. Here we demonstrate that primers based on alpha subunit consensus sequences can also be used for homology PCR. We have used the alpha and beta subunit primers to amplify and clone a large variety of integrin partial cDNAs from several cell types and species. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences reveals a high degree of cross-species conservation (86 to 98 % identity). One alpha subunit (identified in guinea pig airway epithelial cells) and one beta subunit (identified in rabbit leukocytes obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and in human and mouse leukocyte cell lines) have novel sequences that are related to but clearly distinct from all previously reported integrin sequences (24 to 61 % identity). These novel cDNAs are very likely to encode previously unsequenced integrin subunit proteins that are expressed in the lung. Homology PCR is a powerful technique for the identification of known and novel integrin alpha and beta subunit cDNAs in cells from the lung and other organs...|$|E
