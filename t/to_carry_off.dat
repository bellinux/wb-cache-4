However, Brennus' legendary pillage of Delphi is presented as fact by some popular modern historians.|$|E

Before doing so, orders {{were given to}} bombard the government buildings on Ganghwa Island and <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the varied contents of official storehouses there. It was also learned around this time that the two missing missionaries feared captured in Korea had in fact managed to escape to China. This news contributed to the decision to leave.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen of the Susquehannocks {{had been}} {{elsewhere}} when the massacre occurred, and were removed to the workhouse in Lancaster for protection. Lazarus Stewart and Smith, asserting {{that one of}} those fourteen was known as a murderer, assembled the Paxton Boys again. Ignoring Col. Elder, who now remonstrated with them in person, they descended upon Lancaster on December 27, 1763 and broke into the workhouse. Matthew Smith later claimed that the intent of the raid had been <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the single murderous Indian, but the Paxton Boys, in short order, butchered the fourteen unfortunate Susquehannocks. These incidents became known as the Conestoga Massacre.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Lummi tell {{tales about}} Ts'emekwes, the local version of Bigfoot. The stories {{are similar to}} each other in the general {{descriptions}} of Ts'emekwes, but details differed among various family accounts concerning the creature's diet and activities. Some regional versions tell of more threatening creatures. The stiyaha or kwi-kwiyai were a nocturnal race. Children were warned against saying the names, lest the monsters hear and come <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> a person—sometimes to be killed. In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the Indians about skoocooms, a race of cannibalistic wildmen living on the peak of Mount St. Helens in southern Washington state.|$|E

25|$|Records {{indicate}} ongoing maintenance included {{painting in}} 1887-1889 and repainting again in 1890. In 1894, the conservatory’s surrounding landscaping saw numerous transformations in {{preparations for the}} California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. The Conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, the old floors, some of wood and some of concrete, were replaced by new grooved concrete. The grooves in the floor were intended <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the surplus water and make {{a visit to the}} conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete wire netting to stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.|$|E
25|$|Two men are {{executed}} after {{refusing to}} follow a move order to fend off a Soviet winter attack—during which Lahtinen is killed while trying <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> his Maxim M/32-33 machine gun and Rokka distinguishes himself by ambushing a 50-strong enemy unit with a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun. The story moves onto the quiet trench warfare period of the War along the Svir river. The period includes the soldiers drinking kilju, a home-made alcoholic beverage, till intoxication during Commander-in-Chief Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim's birthday, a new recruit being killed by a sniper for failing to listen to advice from experienced veterans and raising his head above the trench, and Rokka capturing an enemy captain during a nightly Soviet skirmish to the Finnish positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{shaft of}} the central cross is covered in small lumps {{as was the case}} with all votive crosses erected to {{celebrate}} the end of an outbreak of the plague. These are thought by some architectural historians to mimick the boil like sores which were one of the symptoms of the bubonic plague. Dismas, the good thief, hangs from a cross to the right of Jesus and an angel stands near his right shoulder ready <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> his soul. The bad thief hangs on the cross to Jesus' left and in his case it is the devil who will carry off his soul. Both the angel and the devil clutch small doll like sculptures no doubt depictions of the souls they will eventually carry off.|$|E

25|$|The basements of bergfrieds {{were often}} {{embedded}} several metres into the ground. Undermining was therefore {{not a great}} threat. Arson was also very difficult due to their stone construction and the few light openings could be quickly closed to prevent being smoked out. The conservative historian therefore sees the bergfried {{as a means of}} passive defence, as a refuge for a few days until relief arrived. For this reason, very few facilities for active defence can be found in these buildings. The main aim was to prevent an attacker breaking in. To storm such a tower within a few days is almost impossible. Thanks to their solid construction many bergfrieds even escaped later demolition attempts by the surrounding rural population, who wanted <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> building materials from abandoned castles and reuse them.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, however, Aloysius is in {{love with}} Clarissa Whortle, the {{daughter}} of a judge. Sir Trevor has led everyone to believe {{that he is going to}} marry Clarissa to assist Aloysius in evading Clarissa's father. Aloysius, on the other hand, has allowed everyone to believe that he will marry Jane. Before going to the Registrar to be married, Aloysius decides that Clarissa's clothing is too fashionable, so Clarissa borrows Jane's nurse attire. Rosebud appears and the mortals criticise her because her skirts are too short. No one wants her assistance, but she explains (mistaking Clarissa for Jane because of the change of clothing) that a demon is planning <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the lady. She vanishes, and everyone is angry with her, thinking her rude. Now Demon Alcohol meets Sir Trevor, who has been left alone. The demon is also confused by the change of clothing; he abducts Clarissa (thinking her to be Jane) and takes her to Sir Trevor's lodgings.|$|E
25|$|Hiller {{slipped away}} from the French and burned the bridges at every major stream during his retreat. On 7 May, the Austrians crossed to the north bank of the Danube at Mautern an der Donau which is near Krems an der Donau. Hiller left 10,000 troops under Dedovich to retreat on the south bank. Archduke Maximilian held Vienna with 35,000 troops, {{including}} 14 Landwehr battalions and 6,000 Vienna militia under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough. There were also eight regular, six Landwehr, and six Vienna Volunteers battalions led by Dedovich; the II Reserve Armeekorps grenadier brigade commanded by Kienmayer and General-Major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré; and four battalions and five squadrons jointly led by Nordmann and General-Major Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny. On the evening of 11 May, a French bombardment of Vienna completely unnerved Maximilian. The archduke abandoned {{the city on the}} 12th and withdrew with the greater part of the garrison to the north bank of the Danube, burning all the bridges. O'Reilly was left behind to carry out the surrender which included 13 generals, 180 officers, and 2,000 troops. The French found a military chest containing $4.5 million Gulden and large quantities of food, ammunition, and 100 cannon that Maximilian failed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> or destroy. The next major action was the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21 and 22 May.|$|E

500|$|Her {{starring}} {{roles in}} Heyy Babyy and Kismat Konnection {{also led to}} considerable attention in the media for her [...] "questionable wardrobe". Several publications listed her as the [...] "worst dressed actress" [...] and her costume designers attributed her failure <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> western clothes due to her weight and body structure. She was later praised in the media for wearing saris at public events; designer Niharika Khan explained, [...] "Vidya's beauty lies in her curves. She's comfortable in her voluptuousness, and therefore in a sari."

Cosmopolitans Sophie Goddard deemed the song a laudable addition to the balladry pantheon. Billboard correspondent Jason Lipshutz classified it as [...] "One Direction's own [...] "All I Have To Give," [...] and opined that its synthesizers add a dignified demeanour to the refrain. In contrast, PopMatters writer Zachary Houle criticised the song as jarring, and dismissed it as [...] "a bit cloying," [...] which he attributed to band's [...] "‘90s ancestors." ...|$|E

500|$|Harald became {{extremely}} rich {{during his}} time in the east, and secured the wealth collected in Constantinople by shipments to Kievan Rus' for safekeeping (with Yaroslav the Wise acting as safekeeper for his fortune). The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained, he had participated three times in polutasvarf (loosely translated as [...] "palace-plunder"), a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor, or perhaps the disbursement of funds to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty. It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway. If he participated in polutasvarf three times, these occasions must have been the deaths of Romanos III, Michael IV, and Michael V, in which Harald would have opportunities, beyond his legitimate revenues, <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> immense wealth.|$|E
500|$|Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph [...] {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, {{noting that the}} director turned a formula [...] "good defeats bad" [...] film into a modern-day neo-noir film where [...] "bad fights bad", and wrote, [...] "The new Don {{is more of a}} remix than remake with the scratchy edges smoothened out with grunge grooves and blistering beats. Farhan changes the backdrop and the background and yet manages to keep the original sequences and lines." [...] Gupta also praised the acting, [...] "eye-catching locations", cinematography, and production design, and thought that the [...] "breathtaking chase and action sequences" [...] broke new grounds on Indian screens. Bollywood Hungama's Taran Adarsh rated the film a 3 out of 5, praising the performances of the lead actors and writing [...] "Shah Rukh Khan does very well as Don. He enacts the evil character with flourish. But he fails <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the other role [...] with conviction. It looks made up, it doesn't come natural to him at all.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{in their}} review said that [...] "uneven pacing and tone mar an {{intriguing}} cautionary tale. This collaboration, completed before Clarke's death last March, would've made a better solo project for either author." [...] The Washington Post said that [...] "The Last Theorem {{reads like a}} dog-eared album of favorite themes from yesteryear", referring to Clarke and Pohl topics from the authors' earlier works. Thomas M. Wagner at SF Reviews wrote that [...] "The Last Theorem is a book I really resent not liking, because there's so much about it that deserves to be liked." [...] He said that the first two-thirds is [...] "so good ... it almost, but doesn't quite, {{make up for the}} nonsense that overtakes the whole affair at the climax." [...] Wagner felt that the meeting of [...] "two disparate storytelling sensibilities" [...] was [...] "far less harmonious and compatible" [...] than Clarke and Pohl may have imagined. Wagner summed up by saying that [...] "The Last Theorem is not simply an uneven novel. It's a deeply disjointed one, a book that introduces a host of wonderful ideas and sympathetic, believable characters, only to decide it doesn't trust them <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>off</b> the story in the end, ultimately falling back – disastrously – on dated and dubious formula." [...] Sheila Merritt at SciFi Dimensions said that while it should have been [...] "a fine tribute and a fitting farewell to this master of science fiction", {{it turned out to be}} an [...] "easy book to put down." [...] She said that the plot [...] "meanders in fits and starts" [...] and that the book is too long for the story it tells. Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the first third of the book, but said that for the rest, its [...] "winning and winking self-consciousness evaporates." [...] He wondered how stable the manuscript was when it was published, and added that it does nothing to [...] "burnish the legacy of either of its authors." ...|$|E
