This qualitative {{study was conducted in}} four different universities. There was one teacher from each university who participated on this study as participant. Each teacher was interviewed and observed in 2 SKS teaching period. In addition, the data consisted of qualitative data. The qualitative data were collected through interview, observation, and documents analysis, and were analyzed using Interactive Model. The result reveals that: (1) the teachers who participated on this study fulfilled the <b>teacher‘s</b> <b>efficacy</b> indicators, as follows; (1 a) realizing the importance and the goal of vocabulary teaching, the teachers use diverse teaching strategies to achieve the goal; (1 b) the teachers also managed and organized the class to achieve students‘ mastery in vocabulary; (1 c) the teachers planned what would be taught in their vocabulary class by preparing the materials; (1 d) the teachers were enthusiastic in teaching vocabulary. Those teachers‘ efficacy was reflected in their teaching practices in vocabulary teaching. On their teaching practices, the teachers used lecturing, cooperative learning, and group discussion to enable their students master vocabulary and use the vocabulary in various contexts. Besides using additional reference in preparing the materials, the teachers who were enthusiastic in teaching vocabulary above, also tend to create such a conducive and comfortable class to enable the students master the materials. Then, there are some factors which influence <b>teacher‘s</b> <b>efficacy</b> in teaching vocabulary. The factors are: (1) references; (2) feeling of having competence; (3) facilities; (4) students‘ enthusiasm; (5) experience. From the findings of the study, it can be theorized that teachers‘ practices in vocabulary teaching is greatly influenced by their <b>efficacies.</b> Therefore, the <b>teachers</b> should first enrich their <b>efficacies.</b> <b>Teacher‘s</b> <b>Efficacy</b> can lead to such an effective vocabulary teaching.

Research links <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> as a variable that has been associated with increases in student achievement. Because <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> is related to increases in student achievement, the principals' role in increasing <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> appears warranted. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a professional development program designed to build the knowledge and competency of principals to affect increases in <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> will alter their practice. Developing a deeper understanding of what principals can do to build <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> is the driving force behind conducting this study. Identifying what principals can do to foster <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> is necessary for practice. Those responsible for providing principal training may benefit from understanding how school leaders can become knowledgeable of and proficient in increasing <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy.</b> The researcher evaluated the experiences of six middle school principals who participated in professional development activities and events related to <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy.</b> The principals participated in a series of five 2 -hour professional development events over a 5 -week period.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{becoming}} a teacher integrates and distils past and social experiences, and episodes in life that result in a cumulative history. This history can shape the identity of student, teacher and preservice teacher to ultimately {{become part of the}} broader context of education. Increasingly, we see students entering the teaching profession from diverse backgrounds that include a cross-section of vocational, cultural and international contexts and circumstances. This is largely representative of today’s mobilized  communities that have been shaped and defined by a globalized marketplace. In this article I discuss issues of identity of preservice teachers in light of trending  globalization, and the increasing imperative for teachers to be reflexive practitioners. Using Ulrich Beck’s theory of reflexive modernization provides a framework that can link these  preservice teacher identities with globalization, modernization and emergent risk societies. In identifying risk societies as a deterioration of previously valued  social norms, Beck suggests that individuals and risk societies are enmeshed together. Ironically, these evolving societies must still provide for the needs of its individuals, who, in turn exercise increasing choice in their future. Maintaining identity in these uncertain environments can collide with overall wellbeing.   For the preservice teacher an erosion of identity can exaggerate feelings of disempowerment and discomfort.

Students’ characteristics and teachers’ {{roles in the}} sub-degree sector are different from other sectors. It was important to investigate the factors related with <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> of sub-degree teachers. Method. Sixty sub-degree teachers were surveyed, and 58 of them were valid (33 males and 25 females). The questionnaire contained three <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> scales: <b>Teacher</b> <b>Efficacy</b> Scale (TES) (short form), Bandura’s Instrument Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale (TSES), and Teachers’ Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSoES) and an instrument of self-rating’s levels of concerns. Results. The <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> scales {{were found to be}} reliable in the sub-degree sector. The levels of education and educational trainings were not found to be related with any <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> scales. Level of concerns of <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> was found to be significant related with TSES’ efficacy to influence parental involvement and ToSES’s instruction strategies. Conclusion. This study found that educational trainings and levels of educations were not related with <b>teacher</b> <b>efficacy</b> and could persuade institutes not to view educational backgrounds as the most influencing factor in employment selections and design better staff developments instead of only sponsoring teachers to pursue further studies...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} indicates that transformational leadership affects teachers’ commitment to their school. The present study aims to investigate the processes explaining this effect at the organisational level. Using a sample of 660 teachers within 50 primary French-speaking Belgian schools, the authors test a model hypothesising that the impact of the school principal’s transformational leadership (as an organisational-level construct) on teacher commitment to school is mediated by school culture strength (cognitive pathway) and <b>teacher</b> collective <b>efficacy</b> beliefs (motivational pathway). Results of multilevel analyses largely support the theoretical model, but show that schools have a limited impact on teacher commitment...|$|R
