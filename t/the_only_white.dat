5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> men in Gabon were French.|$|E
5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated {{the repeal of the}} state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> person included in William Decker Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> student in the classroom. Most {{of the students had}} no problem with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E

5|$|After {{his parents}} {{separated}} {{when he was}} ten, Beck stayed {{with his mother and}} brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings—everything from hip hop to Latin music and his mother's art scene—all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work. Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. During his teens, Beck discovered the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore and X, but remained uninterested in most music outside folk until many years into his career. The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the early 1980s. Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> child at his school, and he quickly learned to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a friend's house, and spent hours in his room trying to emulate the country-blues guitarist's finger picking techniques. Shortly thereafter, Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson.|$|E
5|$|In the 1948 season, the White Sox faced {{difficult}} decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation. In {{the midst of}} Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence {{for most of the}} preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against Johnny Schmitz, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0, making Grove <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>White</b> Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, {{and by the end of}} the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay {{engineered}} {{a controversial}} mid-decade redistricting. He was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> Democratic congressman not {{targeted by the}} remap. However, his district was shifted slightly to the north. Tyler, {{the heart of the}} 4th for a century, was shifted to the neighboring 1st District.

He testified that Clemons and Richardson were the ones who had pushed the two girls. Winfrey was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> member of the convicted group, which has been raised as a criticism since he was the main prosecution witness.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{she served}} as {{chairman}} of the Negro Division of the Hollywood Victory Committee, providing entertainment for soldiers stationed at military bases. (The military was segregated, and black entertainers were not allowed to serve on white entertainment committees.) She elicited the help of a friend, the actor Leigh Whipper, and other black entertainers for her committee. She made numerous personal appearances at military hospitals, threw parties, and performed at United Service Organizations (USO) shows and war bond rallies to raise funds to support the war on behalf of the Victory Committee. Bette Davis was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> member of McDaniel's acting troupe to perform for black regiments; Lena Horne and Ethel Waters also participated. McDaniel was also a member of American Women's Voluntary Services.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{raised about}} effects of {{coloured}} immigration in communities in his constituency {{played a part}} in his commentary. In March 1968, the month before the Rivers of Blood speech, he made his first public references to them in a speech in Walsall, when he described the concern of an anonymous constituent whose daughter was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> child in her primary school class and suffered bullying from non-white pupils. When Wolverhampton Express and Star journalists failed to find the child or the class, the paper's editor and a then personal friend, Clement Jones, challenged him, stating Jones himself had similar anonymous complaints that were traced to members of the National Front (NF). Powell would not accept the explanation and told Jones he had received 'bags of supporting mail' {{as a result of the}} Walsall speech.|$|E

It made its world premiere on MTV's Making the Video on September 24 at 5 p.m. EST, the same day the song officially hit the American radio stations, and debuted at number one on Total Request Live two days later. The video also made its world premiere on BET's 106 & Park on October 16, 2001, making Spears <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> artist to get rotation on an African-American show. It was choreographed by Wade Robson and Crystal Chewning, though some of the dancing was choreographed by Puerto-Rican dancer and Prince's ex-wife Mayte Garcia, who taught Spears bellydancing for the video.|$|E

He earned a PhD from his alma mater, Rice University, and taught college history in Texas. Parrish died on Tuesday, April 7, 1987 of cardiac arrest at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Piney Point, Maryland.

500|$|The {{destroyed}} park is quarantined, and {{the scientist}} advises against {{a mission to}} rescue those trapped inside, fearing their exposure to [...] "pee contamination" [...] has turned them into dangerous, hate-filled mutants. To prove his theory, the scientist urinates onto a test monkey, which clearly becomes annoyed and enraged. An antidote to this reaction is then tested on other monkeys, but proven unsuccessful when the monkeys still become angered when urinated on. Meanwhile, Cartman clings to debris to stay afloat, while the other boys have reached higher ground. Cartman is rescued by the occupants of an inflatable raft from a water park ride. Noticing he is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> person in the raft, Cartman assumes he is the [...] "last of his species," [...] and that his envisioned 2012 scenario has occurred three years early.

50|$|By early 1913, in {{anticipation}} for Piper’s arrival, a mission was built near Masumba, {{the village of}} Mwata Yamvo, the Paramount Chief of the Lunda tribe. The Lunda tribe {{was part of the}} Bantu people. Piper and his team would be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>whites,</b> besides two nearby government officials, in the area of 15,000 square miles (38,850 square kilometres) with 45,000 Africans. The remoteness of Mwata-Yamvo was evident as it was about 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometres) from the coast, 500 miles (805 kilometres) away from the Northern Rhodesian border and 100 miles (160 kilometres) away from the border of Angola.|$|R
500|$|Mohun's party {{followed}} the river north to Stanley Falls where, after three years, the expedition completed the line some distance {{short of the}} Nile. [...] The telegraph was some [...] long and enabled the transmission of messages across the African interior for the first time. [...] As a result, Mohun claimed to be known amongst the indigenous peoples along the route as [...] "Big master of the telephone". [...] Mohun, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> survivor of the expedition, returned to Belgium from the west coast Congo ports and thus completed an east-west traverse of the continent. Mohun {{claimed to be the}} first American to achieve the feat, a credit usually given to Henry Morton Stanley for his 1874-77 expedition. [...] Mohun's claim may have been due to knowing Stanley was a naturalised American citizen born in Wales. He is regarded as one of three Americans who played key roles in opening the Belgian Congo to outsiders, alongside Stanley and the missionary William Henry Sheppard.|$|E
500|$|Thome {{was born}} in Peoria, Illinois, on August 27, 1970, the {{youngest}} of five children. Everyone within the blue-collar Thome family played sports: Jim's grandmother was hired at a local Caterpillar plant solely {{to play for the}} company's softball team; his father built bulldozers for Caterpillar and played slow-pitch softball; his aunt {{is a member of the}} Women's Softball Hall of Fame; and his two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at Limestone High School. Thome learned to play baseball from his father on a tennis court, and also played basketball in what he described as the [...] "ghetto" [...] of Peoria, noting that he was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> kid there but that he earned the respect of his fellow players. One day during his youth, Thome sneaked into the Cubs' clubhouse at Wrigley Field in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain an autograph from his favorite player, Dave Kingman. Though Thome received signatures from several other players, this experience influenced him to be generous with signing autographs for fans during his playing career.|$|E
500|$|On July 4, 1800, the Indiana Territory was {{established}} out of Northwest Territory {{in preparation for}} Ohio's statehood. The capital of the new territory was Vincennes, a former French trading post and one of <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>white</b> settlements in the vast territory. The name Indiana meant [...] "Land of the Indians", and referred {{to the fact that}} most of the area north of the Ohio River was still inhabited by Native Americans. (South of the river, Kentucky had been a traditional hunting ground for the Northwestern and other tribes, and early American settlers in Kentucky referred to the north bank as the land of the Indians.) In 1768, several colonies purchased the Iroquois claim to the northwest and established the Indiana Land Company to hold that claim, the first recorded use of the word Indiana. The claim to the land was disputed by Virginia, and the company's claim was extinguished in a 1798 United States Supreme Court case. Two years later, Congress used the name of the company and applied it to the new territory.|$|E
