5|$|The 1967 Marine Broadcasting Offences Act officially outlawed {{offshore}} stations, but unlicensed radio continued, {{moving from}} ships and sea-based platforms to urban {{areas in the}} latter part of the 1960s (they were already illegal under <b>the</b> <b>Wireless</b> Telegraphy Act 1949). During this period, home-made medium wave (and sometimes short wave) transmitters were often constructed inside cheap, expendable biscuit tins.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wireless</b> Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. <b>The</b> <b>Wireless</b> Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E

5|$|After an unopposed landing, a mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police mounted a stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> station at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of the war and the only significant action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} the British steamer, Emden turned south to Simalur, {{where she met}} the captured collier Buresk. Müller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the Cocos Islands; he intended to destroy <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> station there and draw away British forces searching {{for him in the}} Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, Emden spent two days combing the Sunda Strait for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off Direction Island at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by Kapitänleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hellmuth von Mücke, Emdens executive officer. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.|$|E
5|$|Australian ships {{first saw}} action Asian and Pacific theatre; {{assisting}} {{in the attack}} on German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN). Germany had colonised the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups in 1884, and the colony was currently used as a wireless radio base, Britain required <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> installations to be destroyed because they were used by the German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the region. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru, and Rabaul in New Britain. On 30 August 1914, the AN left Sydney {{under the protection of}} Australia and Melbourne for Port Moresby, where the force met the Queensland contingent, aboard the transport HMAHS Kanowna. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, leaving Kanowna behind when her stokers refused to work. Sydney and her escorting destroyers met the AN off the eastern tip of New Guinea. Melbourne was detached to destroy <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> station on Nauru, while on 14 September, Encounter bombarded a ridge near Rabaul, while half a battalion advanced towards the town. The only major loss of the campaign was the disappearance of the submarine AE1 during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September 1914.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{concerns}} that Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's Pacific Squadron of two armoured cruisers {{would interfere with}} proceedings, the SEF arrived at the capital of Samoa, Apia, on 29 August. It made an unopposed landing, covered by the guns of the accompanying escorts, and secured the Government offices in the town as well as <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> station several miles away. Logan, now the Military Administrator of Samoa with the island's governor a prisoner of war, oversaw the official raising of the Union Jack flag the following day, formally declaring the occupation of Samoa.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany's Pacific colonies. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN), a 2000-man volunteer force—separate from the AIF—and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval reservists and ex-sailors, was rapidly formed {{under the command of}} Colonel William Holmes. The objectives of the force were <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> stations on Nauru, and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands, and at Rabaul in German New Guinea. The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day, encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at Bita Paka and Toma. German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914. Australian losses were light, including six killed during the fighting.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, {{impressed}} {{with what he}} saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions {{as well as new}} ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out.

5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{network was}} also used heavily by {{government}} officials and rescue personnel, who used PDAs or laptops to {{log on to the}} network. It was used by rescue workers who were floating {{in the middle of the}} river and who could receive the signal to communicate with the headquarters in charge of the rescue operations. <b>The</b> <b>wireless</b> service was integral in sending large GIS files to the scene for rescuers to use in locating survivors. It was also utilized by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the American Red Cross, and media outlets, both local and national. Retroactively, various Minneapolis officials deemed the presence of the network essential to the success of the response to the collapse.|$|E
5|$|The network, {{which offers}} speeds {{of one to}} six megabits per second {{at a rate of}} about $20 per month, had about 20,000 {{residential}} subscribers by the end of 2010. Municipally, the network is used by city inspectors and employees, with plans in place for the police and fire departments to use it in the future. In 2007, when the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed, <b>the</b> <b>wireless</b> system helped coordinate rescuers and emergency services. The city and USI Wireless have won praise for the network, which has been singled out for being one of the few successful municipal wireless ventures nationwide among a number of stalled or failed projects.|$|E
