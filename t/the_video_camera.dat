5|$|Sienna grows {{feelings}} for Darren and they kiss, although Darren later reunites with Nancy after she recovers. Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, {{in order to make it}} look like she is still addicted to painkillers. Tom catches Sienna trying to breast feed Oscar, although Sienna accuses Tom of trying to take topless pictures of her. Darren believes Sienna's lies that Nancy is still a painkiller addict, resulting in Nancy moving out and Darren and Sienna beginning a relationship. Sienna begins faking a pregnancy although is devastated when she overhears Darren saying he doesn't want the baby. In order to get Darren closer, Sienna attempts to officially get rid of Nancy and she frames Nancy for trying to kill Oscar, Charlie and herself. Nancy is taken to a mental institute because of this. Darren later finds out that Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth) is his mother and disowns Jack for lying to him for years. Darren, Sienna and Oscar move out because of this. Tom realizes what Sienna has done to Nancy and attempts to expose her by putting a video camera in her bedroom. Darren finds <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> however, and assumes that Tom had been trying to film Sienna topless again leaving Darren furious with Tom. Darren later makes up with Jack when he is nearly killed in an explosion.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, Bill Belichick {{was accused}} by the Jets of authorizing {{his staff to}} film the Jets' {{defensive}} signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that is, {{they have}} a characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide {{a certain number of}} samples (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant number of samples per second. Some of the most dramatic and subtle examples of aliasing occur when the signal being sampled also has periodic content.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} is features technology such as <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> that are {{installed in the}} intensive care units of the hospital wards. Apart from monitoring,the tiny cameras mounted on top of 100 ICU beds in the 330-bedded hospital. <b>The</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras,</b> which look like CCTV cameras,have been used as patient monitoring cameras. Hospital authorities say that the cameras are to keep the visitors within the hospital to the minimum, thereby reducing the chances of infection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{head mounted}} display (HMD) that is {{optically}} opaque {{with respect to the}} outer world can be provided with see-through capability by mounting <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> to <b>the</b> outside of the helmet. Stereoscopic views of the physical space surrounding the wearer are captured by <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> and are projected to the display screens inside the HMD. In this paper, the authors describe the conditions necessary for mounting the cameras to a pre-existing, non-see-through HMD before discussing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different mounting schemes. We finally describe the design of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> lenses to be used with this specific application. 1...|$|R

25|$|With video interpreting, sign {{language}} interpreters work remotely with live {{video and audio}} feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting {{can be used for}} situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> remotely, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{recovered}} {{items was}} a videotape recording {{made by the}} astronauts during the start of re-entry. The 13-minute recording shows the flight crew astronauts conducting routine re-entry procedures and joking with each other. None gives any indication of a problem. In the video, the flight-deck crew puts on their gloves and passes <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> around to record plasma and flames visible outside {{the windows of the}} orbiter (a normal occurrence). The recording, which on normal flights would have continued through landing, ends about four minutes before the shuttle began to disintegrate and 11 minutes before Mission Control lost the signal from the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|As Langdon regains consciousness, {{he finds}} himself in a {{hospital}} located on an island. He is given <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> which he placed {{in the pocket of}} his tweed jacket. He is shocked when he hears the footage and becomes desperate to head back to the Vatican. The video shows the camerlengo branding himself with the Illuminati diamond and confessing that he himself is Janus, and who set in motion the night's chain of events in order to sabotage the Vatican. He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.|$|E
50|$|A severe silt out {{will make}} <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> on a ROV ineffective, though many also have sonar, which will {{continue}} to work through silted water, but this generally makes operation more difficult for the pilot, and the mission objectives may become impossible.|$|R

50|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, most image {{acquisition}} in video microscopy applications was typically done with an analog <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> often simply closed circuit TV cameras. While this required {{the use of}} a frame grabber to digitize <b>the</b> images, <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> provided images at full video frame rate (25-30 frames per second) allowing live video recording and processing. While the advent of solid state detectors yielded several advantages, <b>the</b> real-time <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> was actually superior in many respects.|$|R
25|$|Just {{minutes before}} the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford {{speaking}} to the men. Moments after the murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately {{drove back to the}} spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00a.m., Chief Deputy Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made a copy of it. The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle {{less than a mile from}} the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of photography {{and more recently}} <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> has opened the art of capturing images of people and scenes at a relatively low cost to the true amateur. A person can now capture images in {{both public and private}} situations. A feature of most private photographs and videos is that they are not intended for viewing outside of a very limited range of people, and seldom if ever by the general public. Amateur photography, which includes nude photography, which has previously been produced for personal enjoyment, is increasingly being more widely disseminated through the internet, at times without the knowledge and consent of the subject of the photograph, and to their subsequent embarrassment. Also, the use of secret photography to capture images of an unsuspecting person (undressed or not, and whether for personal use, or intended for posting on the Internet) creates additional personal privacy issues.|$|E

500|$|The video's filming was {{documented}} by a Making <b>the</b> <b>Video</b> <b>camera</b> crew, and premiered on MTV {{after the program}} on October 20, 1999; it debuted in the United Kingdom and on Total Request Live the following day. A version of the video featuring footage from the film was shown in some countries; to preserve the video's narrative, the film footage appeared on a split screen. [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] video was included on the film's 2000 DVD release and Garbage's 2007 greatest-hits DVD compilation, Absolute Garbage.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario 64 is {{the first}} game to have a [...] "free" [...] camera that can be {{controlled}} independently of the character. Most 3D games from the time use a first-person perspective, or a camera that is fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic system in which <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> is operated by the in-game character Lakitu. The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future. Nintendo Power stated the camera-control scheme is what transitioned platform games into three dimensions, and that the game, along with , [...] "blazed trails" [...] into the 3D era. Along with camera control, the game also innovated in its implementation of movement. Edge stated the game changed [...] "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever". The Nintendo 64's analog stick allows for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital D-pads of other consoles, and Super Mario 64 uses this {{in a way that}} was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. Super Mario 64s controls are fully analog, and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allows for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. Super Mario 64 was one of the first games to implement the system.|$|E

2500|$|Farnsworth {{worked out}} the {{principle}} of the image dissector in the summer of 1921, not long before his fifteenth birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field. In the course of a patent interference suit brought by RCA in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922. [...] Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost. Although Farnsworth was paid royalties by RCA, he never became wealthy. [...] <b>The</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> tube that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as charge-coupled devices started to appear.|$|E
