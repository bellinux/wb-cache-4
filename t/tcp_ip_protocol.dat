40|$|When the <b>TCP</b> and <b>IP</b> <b>protocols</b> {{were first}} {{proposed}} {{the emphasis was}} on a simple best-effort service. Later on TCP was modified {{in order to address}} the issue of congestion control, that is to make sure that the senders would not overwhelm the network by sending data too fast. Over the years these protocols have shown an excellent scalability and have allowed the Internet to grow from a network connecting a few research centers to one that connects a very large number of computers all over the world. In its simplest form, which is still by far the most widely used, TCP congestion control works by using drop tail queues that simply drop packets whenever there is no more space in the router’s buffers. TCP senders react to these losses by reducing their sending window and, hence, their rate. This mechanism, while simple and scalable, has severa...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{applications}} {{often get}} disconnected because TCP times out when a user moves from one location and reconnects at another location. This happens {{even with the}} use of Mobile IP since Mobile IP hides the IP address change from TCP but does nothing to prevent it from timing out. TCP freeze is a technique that is already part of TCP implementations and allows a receiver to stop the transmitter from sending further data when the receiver’s buffers are full. In our proposed PErsistent TCP using Simple freeze (PETS) framework, we combine TCP freeze and Mobile <b>IP</b> to prevent <b>TCP</b> from disconnecting during mobile operations. No modifications of the <b>TCP</b> or <b>IP</b> <b>protocol</b> are needed. The required PETS module can be implemented in mobile agents which are part of the Mobile IP or in IP routers.

He developed the first PDES system solely based on reverse computation, called Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS). for combined shared and distributed memory systems. From 2006 to 2009 Bauer worked under E.H. Page at Mitre Corporation, and {{in collaboration with}} Carothers and Pearce pushed the ROSS simulator to the 131,072 processor Blue Gene/P (Intrepid). This implementation was stable for remote event rates of 100% (every event sent over the network). During his time at RPI and MITRE, Bauer developed the network simulation system ROSS.Net that supports semi-automated experiment design for black-box optimization of network protocol models executing in ROSS. A primary goal of the system was to optimize multiple network protocol models for execution in ROSS. For example, creating an LP layering structure to eliminate events being passed between network protocol LPs on the same simulated machine optimizes simulation of TCP/IP network nodes by eliminating zero-offset timestamps between <b>TCP</b> and <b>IP</b> <b>protocols.</b> Bauer also constructed RC agent-based models for social contact networks to {{study the effects of}} infectious diseases, in particular pandemic influenza, that scale to hundreds of millions of agents; as well as RC models for Mobile ad-hoc networks implementing functionality of mobility (proximity detection) and highly accurate physical layer electromagnetic wave propagation (Transmission Line Matrix model).|$|R

The cloud services are based on Internet i. e. <b>TCP</b> <b>IP.</b> The paper discusses limitations {{of one of the}} main existing network management protocol i. e. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) with respect to the current network conditions. The network traffic is growing at a high speed. When we talk about the networked environment of cloud, the monitoring tool should be capable of handling the traffic tribulations efficiently and represent a correct scenario of the network condition. The proposed Model Cloud Network Management Model provides a comprehensive solution to manage the growing traffic in cloud and trying to improve communication of manager and agents as in SNMP (the traditional <b>TCP</b> <b>IP</b> network management <b>protocol).</b> Firstly CNMM concentrates on reduction of packet exchange between manager and agent. Secondly it eliminates the counter problems exist in SNMP by having periodic updates from agent without querying by the manager. For better management we are including managers using virtualized technology. CNMM is a proposed model with efficient communication, secure packet delivery and reduced traffic. Though the proposed model supposed to manage the cloud traffic in a better and efficient way, the model is still a theoretical study, its implementation and results are yet to discover. The model however is the first step towards development of supported algorithms and protocol. Our further study will concentrate on development of supported algorithms.

40|$|The {{designers}} of the TCP/IP protocol suite explicitly included support of satellites in their design goals. The {{goal of the}} Internet Project was to design a protocol which could be layered over different networking technologies {{to allow them to}} be concatenated into an internet. The results of this project included two <b>protocols,</b> <b>IP</b> and <b>TCP.</b> <b>IP</b> is the <b>protocol</b> used by all elements in the network and it defines the standard packet format for <b>IP</b> datagrams. <b>TCP</b> is the end-to-end transport protocol commonly used between end systems on the Internet to derive a reliable bi-directional byte-pipe service from the underlying unreliable IP datagram service. Satellite links are explicitly mentioned in Vint Cerf's 2 -page article which appeared in 1980 in CCR [2] to introduce the specifications for <b>IP</b> and <b>TCP.</b> In the past fifteen years, TCP has been demonstrated to work over many differing networking technologies, including over paths including satellites links. So if satellite links were {{in the minds of the}} designers from the beginning, what is the problem? The problem is that the performance of TCP has in some cases been disappointing. A goal of the authors of the original specification of TCP was to specify only enough behavior to ensure interoperability. The specification left a number of important decisions, in particular how much data is to be sent when, to the implementor. This was deliberately' done. By leaving performance-related decisions to the implementor, this would allow the protocol TCP to be tuned and adapted to different networks and situations in the future without the need to revise the specification of the protocol, or break interoperability. Interoperability would continue while future implementations would be allowed flexibility to adapt to needs which could not be anticipated at the time of the original protocol design...|$|R
