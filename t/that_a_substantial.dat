5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> portion of the submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, with about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the fire that {{destroyed}} the priory in 1289 {{can be seen in}} scorched paving between the surviving pillars. It was thought the church had been completely rebuilt, but excavations in the 1980s show <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> amount of the less damaged west end was reused which resulted in a distinct inconsistency between the two ends, which were constructed in different architectural styles. Rebuilding was a major task that took several generations and was probably not completed {{until the end of the}} 14th century. It is unclear how much of the second priory survived the fire. Where the priory was rebuilt, its builders reused as much as possible; the core of the surviving eastern gable wall is full of fragments from the destroyed second priory.|$|E
5|$|This war also {{proceeded}} disastrously for the Stadtholder's forces, and in {{the severe}} winter of 1794/95 a French army under general Charles Pichegru, with a Dutch contingent under general Herman Willem Daendels, crossed the great frozen rivers that traditionally protected the Netherlands from invasion. Aided by the fact <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> proportion of the Dutch population looked favorably upon the French incursion, and often considered it a liberation, the French were quickly able to break {{the resistance of the}} forces of the Stadtholder, and his Austrian and British allies. However, in many cities revolution broke out even before the French arrived and Revolutionary Committees took over the city governments, and (provisionally) the national government also. William was forced to flee to England on a fishing boat on 18 January 1795.|$|E
