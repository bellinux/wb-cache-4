5|$|One of the accused, Demdike, {{had been}} {{regarded}} {{in the area}} as a witch for fifty years, {{and some of the}} deaths the witches were accused of had happened many years before Roger Nowell started to take an interest in 1612. The event <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.|$|E

In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a murder <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been committed by a blind woman, Marty Glenn (Lili Taylor), but Mulder suspects that she is capable of seeing images in some other way. Eventually, it is revealed that Glenn, while blind, can see the actions of her murderous father via her mind's eye.|$|E

The corpse is revealed {{as that of a}} servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress {{is still on the}} bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a soup tureen that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{difficult}} to excavate, as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation. A defensive system against floods, composed of a circular embankment was unearthed, {{in addition to a}} circular 6.7m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies. An area of 300 meters long filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters, separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters, and was strengthened by defensive towers. Other findings include one of the city gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, in addition to residential houses. Mari had a central mound, however no temple or palaces have been unearthed, although a large building <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been an administrative one was unearthed which had stone foundations and dimensions of (32 meters X 25 meters), with rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide. The city was abandoned {{at the end of the}} Early Dynastic period II c. 2550 BC for unknown reasons.|$|E

60|$|The {{final version}} of this brief but {{laborious}} score has been preserved, and all the stages in its progress have been abundantly annotated. To follow it through in detail, however, would be but weariness. All the salient points in its production fall under one of three heads. There are, first, the passages <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been produced in co-operation with the sitters. There are, second, the passages <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been produced in independence of the sitters. And there are, third, the passages <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been produced in direct opposition to the sitters. Examples of all three classes follow; perhaps only those of the third and last class are really important.|$|R

25|$|The {{biography}} of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped {{to spread the}} concept of Christian monasticism, particularly in Western Europe via its Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, {{the first to go}} into the wilderness (about 270), a geographical move <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> contributed to his renown. Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the Eastern Desert of Egypt inspired the often-repeated subject of the temptation of St. Anthony in Western art and literature.|$|E

The ranks however are also designated by letters, {{with the exception of the}} 8th rank which is distinct because it has no letter. The ranks are lettered in reverse - from the 7th to the 1st: k, l, m, n, o, p, q.|$|E
25|$|In 1601, in {{addition}} to their tangential involvement with the Essex rebellion, the company played a role in a less serious conflict, the so-called War of the Theatres. They produced Thomas Dekker's Satiromastix, a satire on Ben Jonson <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ended the dispute. Somewhat uncharacteristically, Jonson {{does not appear to have}} held a grudge against the company; in 1603, they staged his Sejanus, with dissatisfying results. They also performed The London Prodigal, The Merry Devil of Edmonton, and The Fair Maid of Bristow, the last a rarity in that it is a Chamberlain's play that has never been attributed in any part to Shakespeare.|$|E

Recent excavations near the pyramids led by Mark Lehner have uncovered a large city <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> housed, fed and supplied the pyramid workers. Although it was once believed that slaves built these monuments, a theory based on The Exodus narrative of the Hebrew Bible, study of the tombs of the workmen, who oversaw construction on the pyramids, has shown they were built by a corv√©e of peasants drawn from across Egypt. They apparently worked while the annual flood covered their fields, {{as well as a}} very large crew of specialists, including stonecutters, painters, mathematicians and priests.|$|E
