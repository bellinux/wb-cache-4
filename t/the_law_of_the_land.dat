5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them.

It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source is the closest system {{in the modern world}} to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E

5|$|The late 1930s saw the {{emergence}} of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations.

5|$|Gradually {{there were}} {{increased}} number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior, limiting their ability to participate in society, and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians {{in the hope that}} they would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis.|$|E
5|$|Payne {{drew up a}} {{compromise}} bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks {{would be required to}} build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter.

25|$|The 17th {{century was}} {{an era of}} very strict Lutheran orthodoxy. In 1608, the law of Moses was {{declared}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> in addition to secular legislation. Every subject of the realm was required to confess the Lutheran faith and church attendance was mandatory. Ecclesiastical penalties were widely used. The rigorous requirements of orthodoxy were revealed in the dismissal of the Bishop of Turku, Johan Terserus, who wrote a catechism which was decreed heretical in 1664 by the theologians of the Academy of Åbo. On the other hand, the Lutheran requirement of the individual study of Bible prompted the first attempts at wide-scale education. The church required from each person a degree of literacy sufficient to read the basic texts of the Lutheran faith. Although the requirements could be fulfilled by learning the texts by heart, also the skill of reading became known among the population.|$|E

In May 1410 he went again on an embassy to France; on 11 September 1411 he headed a mission to discuss Henry V's marriage with a daughter of the duke of Burgundy; and he was again there in November.|$|E
