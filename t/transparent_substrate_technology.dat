40|$|AbstractIn {{a recent}} paper, the authors {{introduced}} {{a method to}} estimate optical parameters of thin films using transmission data. The associated model assumes that the film is deposited on a completely <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate.</b> It has been observed, however, that small absorption of substrates affect in a nonnegligible way the transmitted energy. The question arises of {{the reliability of the}} estimation method to retrieve optical parameters in the presence of substrates of different thicknesses and absorption degrees. In this paper, transmission spectra of thin films deposited on non-transparent substrates are generated and, as a first approximation, the method based on <b>transparent</b> <b>substrates</b> is used to estimate the optical parameters. As expected, the method is good when the absorption of the substrate is very small, but fails when one deals with less <b>transparent</b> <b>substrates.</b> To overcome this drawback, an iterative procedure is introduced, that allows one to approximate the transmittance with <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate,</b> given the transmittance with absorbent substrate. The updated method turns out to be almost as efficient in the case of absorbent substrates {{as it was in the}} case of transparent ones...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental study on an optimal circular meshed patch antenna inkjet-printed on <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate.</b> Meshed patch antennas provide a cost-effective solution for applications where the antennas {{need to be}} optically transparent. An earlier study has shown that it is feasible to integrate a rectangular meshed patch antenna with 93 % transparency directly on solar cells. Although circular meshed patch antennas {{are as important as}} the rectangular ones, the study on the subject is rather limited due to the limit in fabrication method and lack of an effective feeding method. This paper focuses on the feed design and fast-prototyping with inkjet printing technique, where the antenna geometry is printed on a thin <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> with conductive ink using a commercial printer. The <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> can then be integrated on solar cells. It is found that a non-contact feed using coupling between the feed line and the antenna is more effective and realistic than other feeding methods for solar cell integration. Although the design approach is tested with inkjet printed prototype, it is highly feasible that one can print meshed circular antennas directly on substrates such as cover glass of solar cells...|$|R

40|$|Herein, {{we report}} {{a new version}} of a bioinspired chitin {{nanofiber}} (ChNF) transparent laminated composite film (HCLaminate) made of siloxane hybrid materials (hybrimers) reinforced with ChNFs, which mimics the nanofiber-matrix structure of hierarchical biocomposites. Our HCLaminate is produced via vacuum bag compressing and subsequent UV-curing of the matrix resin-impregnated ChNF transparent paper (ChNF paper). It is worthwhile to note that this new type of ChNF-based <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> film retains the strengths of the original ChNF paper and compensates for ChNF paper's drawbacks as a flexible <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate.</b> As a result, compared with high-performance synthetic plastic films, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ether sulfone), poly(ethylene naphthalate), and polyimide, our HCLaminate is characterized to exhibit extremely smooth surface topography, outstanding optical clarity, high elastic modulus, high dimensional stability, etc. To prove our HCLaminate as a substrate film, we use it to fabricate flexible perovskite solar cells and a touch-screen panel. As far as we know, this work is the first to demonstrate flexible optoelectronics, such as flexible perovskite solar cells and a touch-screen panel, actually fabricated on a composite film made of ChNF. Given its desirable macroscopic properties, we envision our HCLaminate being utilized as a <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> film for flexible green optoelectronics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} {{results of a}} new hybrid laser processing technique; Laser Induced Micro Plasma Processing (LIMP 2). A <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> is placed {{on top of a}} medium that will interact with the laser beam and create a plasma. The plasma and laser beam act in unison to ablate material and create micro-structuring on the “backside” of the substrate. We report the results of a series of experiments on a new laser processing technique that will use the same laser-plasma interaction to micromachining structures into glass and polymer substrates on the “topside” of the substrate and hence machine non-transparent material. This new laser processing technique is called Laser Induced Micro Plasma Processing (LIMP 2). Micromachining of biomedical implants is proving an important enabling technology in controlling cell growth on a macro-scale. This paper discusses LIMP 2 structuring of <b>transparent</b> <b>substrate</b> such as glasses and polymers for this application. Direct machining of these materials by lasers in the near infrared is at present impossible.
