Johnson radioed back Sebille should try to head for a US emergency landing strip in Taegu a short distance away, but Sebille responded with his last known words, [...] "No, I'll never make it.

He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular , he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns.

500|$|Bastard was Somerset's leading wicket-taker {{again in}} 1885, {{claiming}} 25 wickets. In his first {{match for the}} county that summer, he recorded his second ten-wicket match. Facing Hampshire in Taunton, Bastard claimed eight wickets in the first innings, and a further three in the second as Somerset recorded their only win of the year. His next match for the county was also against Hampshire, this time in Southampton. Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture, and after batting first reached 117. In the Hampshire response, a contemporary match report recorded <b>that</b> <b>Bastard</b> [...] "did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants, taking eight of the ten wickets {{at a cost of}} only 59 runs". Despite his performance, Hampshire passed Somerset's total and had a first innings lead of 45 runs. Somerset scored 166 in their second innings, leaving Hampshire requiring 122 to win. Bastard bowled 27 overs in the second innings, but failed to add to his wicket tally, and Hampshire won the match by eight wickets. Bastard's performances during 1885 saw him selected in two games for the Gentlemen during the Scarborough Festival. The team was a young one, as well as three of his Oxford team-mates from that season, Page, Kingsmill Key and Tim O'Brien, {{there were a number of}} players from the Cambridge team chosen. Bastard claimed five wickets in the first innings of the match against I Zingari, but failed to take any against the Players. In 1885, his 62 first-class wickets was the eighteenth highest among bowlers in the country.|$|E

The chant is usually aimed by English football fans towards football referees. It is unlikely, however, <b>that</b> <b>Bastard</b> was the inspiration for the chant; the colour of the clothing he wore while refereeing was not documented, and football chants did not include verbal aggression towards officials until the 1960s, long after Bastard had died.|$|E

He entered the navy and rose through the ranks during the wars with France.

Giancana's crew was also responsible for the murder on August 4, 1952 of African American gambling boss Theodore Roe. Both Jones and Roe were leading South Side [...] "Policy Kings". However, Roe had refused to surrender control of his operation as the Outfit had demanded; on June 19, 1951, Roe fatally shot Lennard [...] "Fat Lennie" [...] Caifano, a made man in Giancana's crew.

2500|$|Zhirinovsky {{also has}} a history of igniting {{personal}} violence in political contexts. In his notorious debate with Boris Nemtsov in 1995 a [...] "juice fight" [...] broke out. In 2003, Zhirinovsky engaged in a fistfight after a television debate with Mikhail Delyagin. In 2005, Zhirinovsky ignited a brawl in the parliament by spitting at a Rodina party legislator, Andrei Saveliyev. In 2008, he showed himself shooting a rifle at the targets representing his political rivals.

Gotsa sued Zhirinovsky in civil court for 1 million rubles (approximately US$38,000) in damages and eventually received a judgment of 30,000 rubles (approximately US$1,150). In April 2014, Zhirinovsky made strong verbal threats against a pregnant journalist during a press conference in the Duma, including ordering his aide to rape the journalist, who had asked Zhirinovsky about possible sanctions against Ukraine amidst the military tensions between the two countries.
