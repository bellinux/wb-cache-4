5|$|The Chartists {{were active}} for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months but the poor {{attendance}} {{at a second}} meeting, held on the moor {{at the same time}} as a racing fixture on 25 May 1839, signalled the end of the movement. Although the movement was not successful initially, most of the Chartists' demands were eventually met by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|UB-43 sank no ships over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> weeks. Author Paul Halpern {{reports that}} the {{majority}} of the German U-boats in the Mediterranean fleet were undergoing repairs and refits at Pola and Cattaro during January. Although no specific mention is made of repairs done on UB-43, the U-boat's inactivity in this period may be for that reason.|$|E
5|$|Although {{eligible}} {{to play for}} Australia, because his father Ioannis Samaras was born in Melbourne, Samaras chose to represent his country of birth, Greece. He made his debut in 2006, and became a regular over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years, earning 81 caps and scoring 9 goals.

5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 and for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for {{the next stage of}} the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped to {{encounter}} a merchant convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London looming out of the darkness ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years.|$|E
5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E

5|$|El Oriente {{was handed}} over to the USMC and {{assigned}} to United States Lines, Inc., for operation. The cargo ship was placed under Panamanian registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of El Orientes movements over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months, but on 17 February El Oriente sailed from Houston, Texas, to Philadelphia and on to Reykjavík. From Reykjavík, she sailed to the Clyde, arriving there at the end of July. Over the next 5 months, El Oriente sailed around the British Isles, calling at Kirkwall, Belfast Lough, Barrow-in-Furness, and Liverpool, and back to Clyde in late December. From there, she sailed on one trip to Murmansk where she arrived on 27 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|HMS Collingwood was {{the lead}} ship of her class of ironclad battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship's {{essential}} design became the standard {{for most of the}} following British battleships. Completed in 1887, she spent the next two years in reserve before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years. After returning home in 1897, the ship spent the next six years as a guardship in Ireland. Collingwood was not significantly damaged during an accidental collision in 1899 and was paid off four years later. The ship was sold for scrap in 1909 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|Long {{decided in}} 1888 {{not to run}} for another term in Congress, and spent <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years in private practice. His clients were {{typically}} corporate interests, and he appeared on their behalf in court {{as well as in}} legislative committee hearings. He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott's Young Men's Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood into the party. When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused. In 1889 he was appointed to the committee overseeing the enlargement of the Massachusetts State House, a post he held until 1897.|$|E
