A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.

5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E

Although prepubertal ovaries are inactive enough that no lipid accumulates to cause damage, once <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to produce estrogen, lipid damage begins to accrue {{and the ability}} to produce estrogen, as well as ovulate, is slowly degraded. Cysts also form in the ovaries. Women with lipoid CAH have been infertile presumably due to anovulation.|$|E

The club colours are red and black. Toulon were Pro D2 champions in 2005, but after finishing 14th in the 2005-06 Top 14 season, they were relegated back down. After signing a number of high-profile players, the club made a strong run at promotion in the 2006–07 season, and succeeded in their promotion quest in 2007–08, winning that season's Pro D2 crown with two rounds to spare. They struggled to avoid relegation {{for much of the}} 2008–09 Top 14 season, but a late-season surge brought them to ninth place and safety.|$|E
25|$|Three {{improvements}} to card security {{have been introduced}} to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit card security code (CSC) is now present {{on the back of}} most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to address these needs through organisations such as PCI DSS and the Secure POS Vendor Alliance.|$|E

They actively seek to consistently voice complaints to the administration, to organize grievance filing to address problems. They occupy day rooms, non-violently refuse to evacuate their cells or initiate sit-ins in visiting rooms, hallways, pod runs and recreation yards when there is the perception of an act of abuse of authority by guards (verbal abuse; physical abuse; meals/recreations or showers being wrongly denied; unsanitary day rooms and showers being allowed to persist; medical being denied; paper work being denied; refusing to contact higher rank {{to address the problems}} and complaints) and when alleged retaliation (thefts, denials, destruction of property; food restrictions; wrongful denials of visits; abuse of inmates) is carried out in response to their grievances.|$|E

However, the band later updated that Latvala's part in the band will be filled in by Antti Wirman, keyboardist Janne Wirman's younger brother for live commitments {{until the end of}} the year; he debuted with the band in a private live show in Helsinki. In a later interview with Wirman, he stated that his brother would not join the band permanently.

2500|$|The term Hispanic as an ethnonym {{emerged in}} the 20th century, {{with the rise of}} {{migration}} of laborers from Spanish-speaking countries of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word [...] "Latino" [...] is often used as a synonym for [...] "Hispanic". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, [...] "Anglo" [...] is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-Hispanic White Americans or European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily English descent.|$|E
2500|$|Five colours {{have been}} {{recognized}} since {{the earliest days of}} heraldry. [...] These are: gules, or red; sable, or black; azure, or blue; vert, or green; and purpure, or purple. [...] Two more were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic authorities: sanguine or murrey, a dark red or mulberry colour, and tenné, an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour. [...] These were termed [...] "stains" [...] by some of the more influential heraldic writers, and supposed to represent some sort of dishonour {{on the part of the}} bearer; but in fact there is no evidence that they were ever so employed, and they probably originated as mere variations of existing colours. [...] Nevertheless, the belief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to prevent them receiving widespread use, and it is only in recent times that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to appear on a regular basis.|$|E
2500|$|Later, the Eleventh Doctor {{entered his}} own {{timeline}} in [...] "The Name of the Doctor" [...] to rescue his companion Clara Oswald, {{and while there}} observed a past incarnation portrayed by John Hurt, one whose actions caused him to be unworthy of the name [...] "Doctor" [...] and viewed as shameful by his future selves. In the 50th anniversary special, [...] "The Day of the Doctor", the Eleventh Doctor encounters both the Tenth Doctor and the War Doctor (played by John Hurt). [...] The Tenth and Eleventh Doctors are generally amicable towards each other, despite bickering, although the War Doctor treats them both as behaving too childishly. Despite this, he does come to admire both of his future incarnations, working together with them and eventually choosing {{to go through with}} the act of destroying Gallifrey because he knows it will help them become what they are. The Tenth and Eleventh are initially leery of the War Doctor, the Eleventh describing him as the [...] "one life I have tried very hard to forget." [...] However, both of them later recognise that the War Doctor followed what seemed to be the only course open to him, and are even willing to help him carry it out so that he won't have to suffer the guilt alone. Fortunately, with influence from the Moment [...] a sentient Time Lord weapon that brought about their meeting [...] the three are able to stumble upon an alternative: sending Gallifrey into a pocket universe, making it seem as though it has been destroyed. The three are then joined by the other nine previous Doctors and the future Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) in this act (the War, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors having evidently contacted them off-screen). The Eleventh Doctor is shown to have memories of these events, but only recalls them after <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun.</b> This is explained in dialogue as an instability in the timeline, which causes the War and Tenth Doctors to forget their meeting, thus maintaining the continuity in which the Doctors from the War Doctor onwards believe themselves to have destroyed Gallifrey.|$|E
