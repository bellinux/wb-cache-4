40|$|The {{secretory}} {{pattern of}} Mullerian <b>Inhibiting</b> <b>Substance</b> in the rat was documented by a graded organ culture assay on {{each day of}} the perinatal period and at more widely spaced intervals in the adult period. The influence of placenta and pituitary on Mullerian <b>Inhibiting</b> <b>Substance</b> production was studied. Fetal testicular fragments were displaced from target Mullerian ducts to determine if Mullerian <b>Inhibiting</b> <b>Substance</b> would act at a distance. Rat testes produced Mullerian <b>Inhibiting</b> <b>Substance</b> throughout the latter third of gestation. Its production continued during the first three weeks of extrauterine life, after which it disappeared, coincident with weaning. Hypophysectomy carried out after 20 days of age was ineffective in restoring Mullerian <b>Inhibiting</b> <b>Substance</b> activity to the adult rat testis. Placental fragments neither prolonged nor enhanced the Mullerian <b>Inhibiting</b> <b>Substance</b> activity of perinatal testes in organ culture.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mullerian <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substance,</b> {{produced}} constitutively by the prepubertal testes, promotes involution of the mullerian ducts during normal male sexual differentiation. In {{children with}} virilization and nonpalpable gonads, only those with testicular tissue should have detectable serum concentrations of mullerian <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substance.</b> METHODS: We measured serum mullerian <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substance</b> in 65 children with virilization at birth and nonpalpable gonads (age at diagnosis, 2 days to 11 years) and serum testosterone in 54 of them either after {{the administration of}} human chorionic gonadotropin or during the physiologic rise in testosterone that occurs in normal infants. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) serum mullerian <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substance</b> concentration in the 17 children with no testicular tissue was 0. 7 +/- 0. 5 ng per milliliter, as compared with 37. 5 +/- 39. 6 ng per milliliter in the 48 children with testes (P CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of serum mullerian <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substance</b> {{can be used to}} determine testicular status in prepubertal children with nonpalpable gonads, thus differentiating anorchia from undescended testes in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism and serving as a measure of testicular integrity in children with intersexual anomalies...|$|R

40|$|Scientific {{research}} concerning growth inhibitors, {{which has}} been pursued for several decades already, dealt mainly with {{the effect of these}} substances on the germination process. WIESNER (1894) demonstrated the presence of a growth inhibitor in the slime of the mistletoe (Viscum album) which prevented the germination of a great variety of seeds. OPPENHEIMER (1922) supplemented the analysis by placing seeds on the pulp of ripe tomatoes and he observed a strong inhibitive effect {{as a result of this}} treatment. In addition, however, he found that the <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substance</b> is thermolabile and insoluble in ether or alcohol. REINHARD (1933) corroborated Oppenheimer’s results for the most part. According to this author, however, the inhibiting agent in tomato juice is thermostabile, and it is not destroyed by boiling, neiher by neutralisation or by diluting the juice 50 times. In other fleshy fruits such as apples, pears and quinces KÖCKEMANN (1934) detected <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> capable of preventing the germination of Lepidium seeds. These substances were reported to be sensitive to peroxide and to alkali, thermostabile and soluble in water and in ether, but insoluble in petroleum ether. On the other hand, the inhibiting agent extracted by LEHMANN (1937) from the exocarp if buckwheat is thermolabile. In Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa, finally, RUGE (1939) demonstrated the presence of an inhibitor that reduces the speed of germination to a considerable extent. FRÖSCHEL’S investigations on Trifolium and Beta will be dealt with in 4. This survey is not quite exhaustive, but clearly demonstrates that the inhibiting agent should not be regarded as a definite, well-defined chemical substance which is always the same in every individual case, but as a group of substances with analogous activities but most probably with widely divergent physical and chemical properties. Following KÖCKEMANN (1934) we can classify the <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> into two groups, as follows : 1. <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> in the testa or in the seed, and 2. <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> in the mesocarp of pulpy fruits...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{scientific}} research on <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> has mainly occupied {{itself with the}} effect of these substances on the germination process, I was able to demonstrate the presence of a root-inhibiting agent during my studies on root formation in Fuchsia hybrida and Pelargonium zonale (Stolk, 1952). In connection with this previous investigation I tried to find out whether a similar substance is present as well in bulbous plants and, by doing so, as a suitable species for my experiments the Liliaceous Allium Cepa was selected. My principal object was to corroborate and, if possible, extend the results obtained with Fuchsia and Pelargonium. A confirmation appeared highly desirable because the experiments with Fuchsia and Pelargonium could not possibly be very accurate on account of the direct method of measuring and that is why I used in my experiments with Allium a root-auxanometer which will be described in the following section. Substances retarding germination were demonstrated in the slime of Viscum album by WIESNER (1894), in the fruit pulp of ripe tomatoes by OPPENHEIMER (1922), in tomato juice by REINHARD (1933), in other pulpy fruits such as apples, pears, quinces and tomatoes by KÖCKEMANN (1934), in the exocarp of buckwheat by LEHMANN (1937), in the fruits of Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa by RUGE (1939) and in Beta by FRÖSCHEL (1939, 1940). That not one and the same inhibitor is involved, is evident {{from the fact that the}} above-mentioned authors found differences between the <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> they studied in their behaviour towards high temperatures. The <b>inhibiting</b> <b>substances</b> found by OPPENHEIMER and LEHMANN, for instance, are thermolabile. those discovered by REINHARD, KÖCKEMANN and FRÖSCHEL thermostabile.

40|$|Both human {{telomeric}} G-rich and C-rich DNA {{have been}} considered as specific drug targets for cancer therapy. However, due to i-motif structure instability and lack of specific binding agents, it remains unclear whether stabilization of telomeric i-motif can <b>inhibit</b> <b>telomerase</b> activity. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been reported as the first ligand that can selectively stabilize human telomeric i-motif DNA. Here we report that SWNTs can <b>inhibit</b> <b>telomerase</b> activity through stabilization of i-motif structure. The persistence of i-motif and the concomitant G-quadruplex eventually leads to telomere uncapping and displaces telomere-binding proteins from telomere. The dysfunctional telomere triggers DNA damage response and elicits upregulation of p 16 and p 21 proteins. This is the first example that SWNTs can <b>inhibit</b> <b>telomerase</b> activity and interfere with the telomere functions in cancer cells. These results provide new insights into understanding the biomedical effects of SWNTs and the biological importance of i-motif DNA.
