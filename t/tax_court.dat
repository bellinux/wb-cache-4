Both commissions have the same members and are chaired by the chief justice.|$|E

During her time there, Hickok's nominal address was at the Mayflower Hotel in DC, where she met most people. Also during this time, she formed an intense {{friendship}} with Marion Janet Harron, a United States <b>Tax</b> <b>Court</b> judge who was ten years younger than she and almost {{the only person to}} visit her at the White House.|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that the <b>Tax</b> <b>Court's</b> {{decisions}} improperly relied on reasoning not embodied in any statutory or regulatory precept, and thus were not in accordance with the law. The court was not empowered to revise the <b>Tax</b> <b>Court's</b> decisions because of a difference of opinion on the existence of deficiencies. The <b>Tax</b> <b>Court's</b> decision settled matters of proper accounting, rather than questions of law, where no statute or regulation directed its method of deficiency determination. Since there was a rational basis for the <b>Tax</b> <b>Court's</b> factual determinations of petitioners' economic gain and <b>tax</b> benefit, the <b>court</b> possessed no compelling reason to substitute its judgment.|$|R

5|$|Minnesota's {{court system}} has three levels. Most cases {{start in the}} {{district}} courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, consisting of nineteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice Minnesota Supreme Court hears all appeals from the <b>tax</b> <b>court,</b> the workers' compensation court of appeals, first-degree murder convictions, and discretionary appeals from the court of appeals; it also has original jurisdiction over election disputes.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 2013, the executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson filed a {{petition}} in the United States <b>Tax</b> <b>Court</b> {{as a result}} of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over U.S. federal estate taxes imposed on the value of Jackson's Estate at the time of his death. The executors claim that the Estate was worth about $7 million. The IRS asserts that the Estate was worth over $1.1 billion, and that over $700 million in federal estate taxes (including penalties) are due. A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017. As of early July 2017, no decision has been rendered.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} reviews death penalty cases, state <b>tax</b> <b>court</b> appeals, and items {{regarding}} legal discipline on direct review. Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and the explanatory statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E

5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, <b>Tax</b> <b>Court,</b> and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{an appeals}} court, the Oregon Supreme Court {{is also the}} court of last resort in Oregon. Although most oral {{arguments}} before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools. All cases are heard en banc by the court. It receives appeals from the Oregon <b>Tax</b> <b>Court,</b> the Oregon Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. Decisions of the court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed {{out of the old}} Oregon Country region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana <b>Tax</b> <b>Court,</b> who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E
