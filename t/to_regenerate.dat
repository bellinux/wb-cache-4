5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E

5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability <b>to</b> <b>regenerate,</b> but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E

5|$|Katrina {{continued}} to track over Central America {{for most of}} October30 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24hours after landfall, the depression moved back over water, in the Gulf of Honduras; however, by this time, there was no convection remaining around the system. The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward. Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> convection before moving back over land near the northern Belize-Mexico border. Around this time, forecasters reported that the depression would re-intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Although situated over land, the depression began <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. By the evening of November1, the depression weakened again and moved into the Gulf of Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later.|$|E

50|$|In {{biological}} oceanography, {{new production}} {{is supported by}} nutrient inputs from outside the euphotic zone, especially upwelling of nutrients from deep water, but also from terrestrial and atmosphere sources (as opposite <b>to</b> <b>regenerated</b> production, which is supported by recycling of nutrients in the euphotic zone). New production depends on mixing and vertical advective processes associated with the circulation.|$|R

The Tenth Doctor comments upon the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS console, [...] "Oh you've redecorated!

5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, in addition <b>to</b> <b>regenerating</b> after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition {{to both of}} these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|R

40|$|Erasure {{correcting}} {{codes are}} widely used to ensure data persistence in distributed storage systems. This paper addresses the simultaneous repair of multiple failures in such codes. We go beyond existing work (i. e., regenerating codes by Dimakis et al.) by describing (i) coordinated regenerating codes (also known as cooperative regenerating codes) which support the simultaneous repair of multiple devices, and (ii) adaptive regenerating codes which allow adapting the parameters at each repair. Similarly <b>to</b> <b>regenerating</b> codes by Dimakis et al., these codes achieve the optimal tradeoff between storage and the repair bandwidth. Based on these extended regenerating codes, we study the impact of lazy repairs applied <b>to</b> <b>regenerating</b> codes and conclude that lazy repairs cannot reduce the costs in term of network bandwidth but allow reducing the disk-related costs (disk bandwidth and disk I/O). Comment: Update to previous version adding (i) study of lazy repairs, (ii) adaptive codes at the MBR point, and (iii) discussion of related work.

5|$|Banksia canei lacks a {{lignotuber}} {{and appears}} <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire {{has been little}} studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about five years is often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Deptford {{experienced}} {{economic decline}} in the 20th century with {{the closing of the}} docks, and the damage caused by the bombing during the Second World War - a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store (now New Cross Gate), killing 160 people. High unemployment caused some of the population to move away as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Deptford's {{economic}} {{history has been}} strongly connected to the Dockyard - when the Dockyard was thriving, so Deptford thrived; with the docks now all closed, Deptford has declined economically.

40|$|Although the {{contribution}} of bone marrow-derived cells <b>to</b> <b>regenerating</b> skeletal muscle has been repeatedly documented, there remains considerable debate as to whether this incorporation is exclusively a result of inflammatory cell fusion <b>to</b> <b>regenerating</b> myofibers or whether certain populations of bone marrow-derived cells {{have the capacity to}} differentiate into muscle. The present study uses a dual-marker approach in which GFP+ cells were intravenously transplanted into lethally irradiated β-galactosidase+ recipients to allow for simple determination of donor and host contribution to the muscle. FACS analysis of cardiotoxin-damaged muscle revealed that CD 45 + bone-marrow side-population (SP) cells, a group enriched in hematopoietic stem cells, can give rise to CD 45 -/Sca 1 +/desmin+ cells capable of myogenic differentiation. Moreover, after immunohistochemical examination of the muscles of both SP- and whole bone marrow-transplanted animals, we noted the presence of myofibers composed only of bone marrow-derived cells. Our findings suggest that a subpopulation of bone marrow SP cells contains precursor cells whose progeny have the potential to differentiate towards a muscle lineage and are capable of de novo myogenesis following transplantation and initiation of muscle repair via chemical damage...|$|R
