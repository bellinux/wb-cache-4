Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him {{it is not about}} money. She holds back <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Tina in a dream, Rahul and {{his family}} go to Anjali's wedding, where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her, and watches in <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> she is brought forth for the wedding. Realising this, Anjali is {{hesitant}} {{to go on with}} the marriage, and stands weeping. Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul. Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry, little Anjali Khanna sees a vision of Tina, who is smiling and giving her the thumbs up. Rahul and Anjali Sharma get married.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E

5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are quite {{different}} from his later ones. The works compiled in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (<b>tears),</b> <b>as</b> well as words such as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E
5|$|The first, iconic uniforms the Raptors wore back in 1995 were {{extraordinarily}} busy, as they featured {{black and}} white <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> pin stripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw {{on one side of}} the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side, and were rounded up with a giant, aggressive-looking raptor dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled new jerseys in 1999−00, launching a unique road jersey which had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward, as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From 2008−09 through 2014−15, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Federer in 5 sets in 4 {{hours and}} 19 minutes, with the match finishing after midnight, {{to become the}} first Spaniard to win the Australian Open. The match was lauded {{as one of the greatest}} ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time, only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final. It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi (he would go on to achieve these in the near future). However, as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records, holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career. Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time. This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that. The defeat brought Federer to <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> he came to terms with his loss.|$|E

5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E

50|$|The cross-pattern {{achieved}} by the above process makes the film difficult to <b>tear</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> providing increased <b>tear</b> propagation and puncture resistance.

30|$|Wear and <b>tear,</b> <b>as</b> {{a form of}} {{physical}} degradation, accumulates with use, and ultimately leads to objects becoming unfit for use. The principles described by reliability engineering (bathtub curve) were {{used to describe the}} process of accumulation of wear and <b>tear,</b> <b>as</b> a function of time. For the typical type of paper representative of ~ 70 – 80  % of Western library and archival collections, we looked at the ‘random failure phase’ when material weakens, {{as well as at the}} ‘wear-out failure phase’ during which reduction in DP becomes so pronounced that wear and tear (mechanical failure) becomes increasingly likely. If the frequency of object use is known, the curve can be experimentally determined.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{cyclosporine}} (Restasis) {{is available}} by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. Prescription drugs {{are also available}} that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. Salagen, a manufactured form of pilocarpine, {{can be used to}} help produce <b>tears,</b> <b>as</b> well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the jaborandi plant.|$|E

25|$|Intrinsic factors {{refer to}} injury {{mechanisms}} that occur within the rotator cuff itself. The principal is a degenerative-microtrauma model, which supposes that age-related tendon damage compounded by chronic microtrauma results in partial tendon tears that then develop into full rotator cuff <b>tears.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of}} repetitive microtrauma {{in the setting of}} a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.|$|E
50|$|A new {{graphics}} engine {{was used to}} animate the various limbs of each character separately, allowing for more fluid animation. This engine also allows the clothes of each character to rip from wear and <b>tear</b> <b>as</b> they take more damage throughout a match.|$|R

25|$|The Cherokee {{eventually}} moved {{south from}} the area now called Virginia. As European colonists spread into the area, the native populations were forcibly displaced {{to the south and}} west, including the Muscogee, Yuchi, Chickasaw and Choctaw peoples. Then, from 1838 to 1839, the US government forced the Cherokee to leave the eastern United States. Nearly 17,000 Cherokee were forced to march from eastern Tennessee to the Indian Territory west of the Arkansas Territory. This {{came to be known as}} the Trail of <b>Tears,</b> <b>as</b> an estimated 4,000 Cherokee died along the way. In the Cherokee language, the event is called Nunna daul Isunyi—"The Trail Where We Cried".|$|E
25|$|While in {{art school}} in the late 1940s, Andy Warhol painted {{a version of the}} photograph, the {{earliest}} of his many paintings based on photographs; the original artwork has not been located and may be lost. Warhol's Disaster Series in the 1960s was a return to that format, to interpretations of the highly visible works produced by photojournalists. In 1977, Lowell Thomas, journalist and narrator for Hearst rival Movietone News, set the photo's influence in America as high as two of the most iconic World War II images: a French man grimacing in <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> his country's soldiers abandon France in June 1940, and Joe Rosenthal's Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, shot in February 1945.|$|E
25|$|Physiological effects, {{similar to}} those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobics. In adults, it may be <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> well as {{excessive}} sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations {{as a result of the}} fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia. These visible symptoms further reinforce the anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations.|$|E

Fashion Monster-era Kyary then hits a TV, seeing now-modern Kyary in hakama, dancing with the new background dancers, the polar bear still watching. All of the previous Kyary incarnations call back to her on a Videophone. Kyary then walks for a while with the polar bear, gives it a hug, and then waves goodbye to it. She then walks off alone, as the polar bear begins to cry at her departure.|$|R
25|$|For Sport Relief 2010 on 19 March 2010, Corden {{appeared}} {{again as}} Smithy {{in a long}} sketch about coaching. Corden had previously recorded a live 9 minute segment during the December 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. It sees Smithy being presented with the Coach of the Year Award for his unsung coaching influence on several British sports stars. As he jokes with the audience he declares he can't accept the award, {{and goes on to}} rant at the assembled sporting stars for having 'lost their way' and focusing on celebrity, ending on a rousing appeal to get back to basics, leaving hosts Sue Barker and Gary Lineker in mock <b>tears.</b> <b>As</b> a backstory, sketches are shown of how Smithy coached Tom Daley, Andrew Flintoff, Andy Murray, Jenson Button, David Beckham and the Manchester United team.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{took great}} pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local {{reputation}} as a boxer. He always strived {{to live up to}} the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained. While Grant liked to think of himself as indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered. Indeed, at times he was just as likely to burst into <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> he was to throw a punch. Because of this, he attracted many women, despite the fact that he often treated them as possessions, disregarding their feelings and eliciting exaggerated revenge should they cross him (resulting in spousal abuse and the destruction of all three of his marriages). His quick temper was off-set by a period of genuine remorse and promises that he would change. However, more often than not, Grant reverted to form and when placed under pressure he seemed incapable of controlling his aggression, disregarding all consequences.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1861, Chase and an aide, Captain Ebenezer Farrand, {{formerly}} {{second in}} command at the Pensacola Navy Yard, appeared at Fort Pickens to demand the surrender of the fort and garrison. Slemmer and his {{second in command}}, Second Lieutenant J. H. Gilman, met Chase outside the fort. Slemmer refused to allow Chase and Farrand in the fort, even though Chase said he had built the fort and would learn nothing from entering it. Slemmer replied that Chase {{did not know what}} preparations he had made and Chase proceeded to state his business. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase said he wanted to avoid bloodshed and that he had written his demand in proper form and would read it. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase's voice shook and his eyes filled with <b>tears</b> <b>as</b> he began his demand that the U.S. Army surrender Fort Pickens, a structure that he had designed and built as a captain with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Chase handed the paper to Farrand to read but Farrand could not see it well at night without his glasses so Gilman had to read it aloud.|$|E
50|$|High {{velocity}} fragmentation {{can also}} increase the effect of temporary cavitation. The fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point.
