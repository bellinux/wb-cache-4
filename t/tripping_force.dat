40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a procedure}} for the calibration of the lateral force {{applied to a}} triangular cantilever tip {{by means of a}} lateral force microscope. The force is directed perpendicular to the cantilever major axis. The lateral force results in a torsion of the cantilever. The torsion signal is monitored as a voltage on a four-sector photodiode. The conversion from a torsion signal to a lateral force depends on the optical geometry of the instrument and the cantilever shape, dimensions and material properties. The calibration procedure used requires a calculation of the elasticity of the cantilever and experimental data. In case <b>tripping</b> <b>forces</b> are ignored, the lateral force can be taken as the friction force. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|New Urbanists decry {{the street}} hierarchy's {{deleterious}} effects on pedestrian travel, {{which is made}} easy and pleasant within the subdivision but is virtually impossible outside it. Residential subdivisions usually have no pedestrian connections between themselves and adjacent commercial areas, and are often separated from them by high masonry walls intended to block noise. New Urbanist writers like Andres Duany and James Howard Kunstler often point out the absurd nature of car <b>trips</b> <b>forced</b> by the street hierarchy: while a grocery store may be less than a quarter-mile distant physically from a given home in a subdivision, the barriers to pedestrian travel presented by the street hierarchy mean that getting a gallon of milk requires a car trip of a mile or more in each direction. Jane Jacobs, among other commentators, {{has gone so far}} as to say that modern suburban design—of which the street hierarchy is the key component—is a major factor in the sedentary lifestyle of today's children. Mass transit advocates contend that the street hierarchy's denigration of pedestrian traffic also reduces the viability of public transportation in areas where it prevails, sharply curtailing the mobility of those who do not own cars or cannot drive them, such as teenagers and the elderly.|$|R

40|$|Upon the {{occurrence}} of out-of-step (OOS) phenomena due to severe fault in the system, it is advisable to initiate <b>force</b> generator <b>tripping</b> {{as soon as possible}} within a few cycles while maintaining system stability.

In this paper, TSI COI Speed and Accelerating Power are used as a new technique to be implemented in FGTS; a complete algorithm is developed that can detect OOS, initiate FGTS, calculate the amount of MW quantum to <b>force</b> <b>trip</b> generator, determine which generator and the most suitable location to <b>force</b> <b>trip</b> generator, evaluate on the effectiveness of FGTS, and initiate contingency action to take if OOS still exists in the system...|$|R
40|$|Two {{isothermal}} round jets at a Mach {{number of}} 0. 9 and a diameter-based Reynolds number of 2 × 105 have been computed by compressible large-eddy simulation using high-order finite differences on {{a grid of}} 3. 1 billion points. At the exit of a pipe nozzle in which a <b>trip</b> <b>forcing</b> is applied, they are characterized by flow parameters, including the momentum thickness and the shape factor of the boundary layer, the momentum-thickness-based Reynolds number, and the peak turbulence intensity, which roughly match those found in experiments using two nozzles {{referred to as the}} ASME and the conical nozzles. The nozzle-exit boundary layer is therefore in a highly disturbed laminar state in the first jet, and in a turbulent state in the second. The exit flow conditions, the shear-layer and jet flow fields, and the far-field noise provided by the highly-resolved simulations are described and compared. The jet with the ASME-like initial conditions develops a little more rapidly with slightly higher turbulence levels than the other. Overall, however, the results obtained for the two jets are very similar, and they are in good agreement with measurements available for Mach number 0. 9 jets. This is in particular true for the far-field pressure spectra. As the ASME nozzle has been reported to yield higher noise levels than the conical nozzle, this suggests that the nozzle-exit conditions of the present jets do not adequately reflect those in the experiments and/or that the link between the noise differences and the jet initial conditions using the two nozzles is not as simple as was first thought.

40|$|Chemical {{propulsion}} {{remains the}} only viable solution as technically matured technology for the near term human space transportation to Lunar and Mars. Current mode of space travel requires us to "take everything we will need", including propellant for the return <b>trip.</b> <b>Forcing</b> the mission designers to carry propellant for the return trip limits payload mass available for mission operations and results in a large and costly (and often unaffordable) design. Producing propellant via In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) will enable missions with chemical propulsion by the "refueling" of return-trip propellant. It will reduce vehicle propellant mass carrying requirement by over 50 %. This mass reduction can translates into increased payload to enhance greater mission capability, reduces vehicle size, weight and cost. It will also reduce size of launch vehicle fairing size as well as number of launches for a given space mission and enables exploration missions with existing chemical propulsion. Mars remains the ultimate destination for Human Space Exploration within the Solar System. The Mars atmospheric consist of 95 % carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{and the presence of}} Ice (water) was detected on Mars surfaces. This presents a basic chemical building block for the ISRU propellant manufacturing. However, the rationale for the right propellant to produce via ISRU appears to be limited to the perception of "what we can produce" as oppose to "what is the right propellant". Methane (CH 4) is often quoted as a logical choice for Mars ISRU propellant, however; it is believed that there are better alternatives available that can result in a better space transportation architecture. A system analysis is needed to determine on what is the right propellant choice for the exploration vehicle. This paper examines the propellant selection for production via ISRU method on Mars surfaces. It will examine propellant trades for the exploration vehicle with resulting impact on vehicle performance, size, and on launch vehicles. It will investigate propellant manufacturing techniques that will be applicable on Mars surfaces and address related issues on storage, transfer, and safety. Finally, it will also address the operability issues associated with the impact of propellant selection on ground processing and launch vehicle integration...|$|R
