5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, toy spaniels {{began to}} feature in {{paintings}} by Dutch {{artists such as}} Caspar Netscher and Peter Paul Rubens. Spanish artists, including Juan de Valdés Leal and Diego Velázquez, also depicted them; in the Spanish works, <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> tricolour, black and white or entirely white. French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon would later describe these types of dogs as crosses between spaniels and Pugs.|$|E

5|$|This type {{of small}} white terrier {{dates back to}} the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795.

5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
50|$|The breed {{standard}} describes <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> {{as having a}} sharp temperament and strong individuality, distrustful of strangers. It's a good guard dog.

In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen could see that <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E

25|$|The German forces {{knew about}} the Soviet dogs from 1941 onwards, and so took {{measures}} to defend against them.

These methods soon spread to Austria-Hungary and Germany; in the latter the first scientific developments in the field took place with experiments in dog breeding and training. The German police selected the German Shepherd Dog as the ideal breed for police work and opened up the first dog training school in 1920 in Greenheide. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> systematically trained in obedience to their officers and tracking and attacking criminals.|$|E

The American Kennel Club recognised the Australian Terrier in 1960, and the United Kennel Club (US) in 1970.
