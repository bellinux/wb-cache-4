40|$|In Australia {{and many}} other {{countries}} worldwide, water used {{in the manufacture of}} concrete must be potable. At present, it is currently thought that concrete properties are highly influenced by the water type used and its proportion in the concrete mix, but actually there is little knowledge of the effects of different, alternative water sources used in concrete mix design. Therefore, the identification of the level and nature of contamination in available water sources and their subsequent influence on concrete properties is becoming increasingly important. Of most interest, is the recycled washout water currently used by batch plants as mixing water for concrete. Recycled washout water is the water used onsite for a variety of purposes, including washing of <b>truck</b> <b>agitator</b> bowls, wetting down of aggregate and run off. This report presents current information on the quality of concrete mixing water in terms of mandatory limits and guidelines on impurities as well as investigating the impact of recycled washout water on concrete performance. It also explores new sources of recycled water in terms of their quality and suitability for use in concrete production. The complete recycling of washout water has been considered for use in concrete mixing plants because of the great benefit in terms of reducing the cost of waste disposal cost and environmental conservation. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of using washout water on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. This was carried out by utilizing a 10 week sampling program from three representative sites across South East Queensland. The sample sites chosen represented a cross-section of plant recycling methods, from most effective to least effective. The washout water samples collected from each site were then analysed in accordance with Standards Association of Australia AS/NZS 5667. 1 : 1998. These tests revealed that, compared with tap water, the washout water was higher in alkalinity, pH, and total dissolved solids content. However, washout water with a total dissolved solids content of less than 6 % could be used in the production of concrete with acceptable strength and durability. These results were then interpreted using chemometric techniques of Principal Component Analysis, SIMCA and the Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods PROMETHEE and GAIA were used to rank the samples from cleanest to unclean. It was found that even the simplest purifying processes provided water suitable for the manufacture of concrete form wash out water. These results were compared to a series of alternative water sources. The water sources included treated effluent, sea water and dam water and were subject to the same testing parameters as the reference set. Analysis of these results also found that despite having higher levels of both organic and inorganic properties, the waters complied with the parameter thresholds given in the American Standard Test Method (ASTM) C 913 - 08. All of the alternative sources were found to be suitable sources of water for the manufacture of plain concrete...|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the properties of}} the mixtures for the actual field condition, slump and slump flow tests for workability, air content and compressive strength for mechanical properties were measured. The testing samples were obtained from the first and third <b>agitator</b> <b>trucks</b> to arrive at the construction site, and tested samples were obtained before and after the pumping. Each test was conducted following ASTM C 143, C 1611 (2010), C 231 (2010), and C 39 methods for slump, slump flow, air content, and compressive strength, respectively. The compressive strength was tested at 7 and 28 -day ages.|$|R
30|$|The {{concrete}} mixture {{was mixed}} in the ready-mix concrete plant {{with the central}} mix method. However, the designated ready mix concrete plant was a general plant for normal ready mixed concrete; {{it did not have}} the setting for fiber introduction, and thus the fiber was introduced manually through the material feeding entrance for pre-measured amounts. The mixing time for FRC was increased by 1 to 2  min instead of 30 to 40  s of normal concrete mixing to provide sufficient workability and dispersion of fibers. Other process of delivering and the placing process of concrete was the same as the general process with the <b>agitator</b> <b>trucks</b> and truck pump following the South Korean ready-mixed concrete standard of KS F 4009 (Korea Standards Association 2011).|$|R
30|$|Although many {{researchers}} have used hybrid fibers for improving mechanical properties, the study on achieving both workability and mechanical properties {{has not been}} reported sufficiently. Especially, due to the decreased workability of FRC, it {{has been difficult to}} apply FRC on-site using the ready mix concrete system with plant mixing and mobile concrete <b>agitator</b> <b>truck</b> delivery. The objective of this research was to provide both sufficient concrete protection performance and acceptable workability for ready mix concrete systems by using the suggested hybrid fibers. To evaluate the field applicability of fresh properties, a sufficient workability was evaluated with an appropriate range of slump and air content, and to evaluate the protection performance, the impact test using a high velocity projectile was executed. Additionally, to evaluate the applicability of FRC for a ready-mix concrete system and on-site placing, regarding the actual construction project, the determined mixture with hybrid fibers was applied to the ready-mixed concrete system. Hybrid fibers made success possible in this research. Furthermore, an actual example of applying FRC to a ready-mix concrete system is provided.|$|R
