500|$|The young Max {{was exposed}} to music early on, {{attending}} Broadway shows weekly {{from the age of}} two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He knew {{he wanted to be a}} drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on The Milton Berle Show in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> who wanted to develop a life in rock 'n' roll music had a moment. That was my moment," [...] and Fontana became a major influence on him.|$|E

500|$|The Big 12 Championship Game {{is held by}} the Big 12 Conference each year. The {{championship}} game pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. Despite losing {{the last two games}} of the regular season, Colorado retained {{the best record in the}} North Division of the Big 12 Conference. Prior to the game, Colorado head coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> expects us to come in here and beat Texas." [...] His team lost the game 70–3, the most lopsided score in any college football conference championship to date.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Beshear {{delivered}} the Democratic {{response to a}} speech to {{a joint session of}} the United States Congress given by President Donald Trump on February 28, 2017. Beshear was chosen due to his successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky and to bring back the white, rural voters that Democrats felt they had lost in the 2016 presidential election. Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat, praised the choice, saying [...] " [...] led the country in the health care exchanges in the Affordable Care Act, knows firsthand about the success of the Affordable Care Act" [...] Other Democrats, however, felt it was a mistake, with Pennsylvania's Bob Brady saying, [...] "I don't know who the former governor of Kentucky is, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> else does, either. Do you?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "And {{he never}} tried to impress {{us that he was}} doing any miracles," [...] Welles recalled. [...] "I was calling for things only a {{beginner}} would have been ignorant enough to <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> could ever do, and there he was, doing them." [...] Toland later explained that he wanted to work with Welles because he anticipated the first time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do. Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities. During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E

500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} to ponder his senate race decision; {{when he had}} dinner with Nathan on May 12, they were trailed by a flock of photographers. [...] Giuliani canceled campaigning and fundraising trips to upstate New York and California on May 13, suggesting he would not run, but then resumed fundraising and suggested he was inclined towards running on May 15. [...] Two Republican county chairmen became upset at the indecision, saying, [...] "Like Waiting for Godot, we have Waiting for Rudy", and, [...] "We need a decision. Like tomorrow would be nice. Because this is getting ridiculous." [...] A top state Republican said, [...] "He seem to like the attention. He {{seems to be going}} through some sort of catharsis in public. And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it out. I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> can." [...] Clinton, meanwhile, said as little as possible about the situation, preferring to let Giuliani's drama play out on its own; on May 17, as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides, she won the unanimous approval of delegates to the Democratic Party state convention at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent.|$|E
500|$|He led the Vale {{to victory}} over Championship sides Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday {{in the opening}} rounds of the League Cup. However {{following}} {{a period of three}} defeats in seven days, Adams decided to place his whole squad on the transfer list, saying of his team's performance: [...] "We looked like a woman who had a big fur coat on but underneath she’s got no knickers on." [...] It was a controversial move, one that divided opinion among analysts and fans, also bringing the fourth tier club to national attention. He later admitted he merely played [...] "a psychological game with them... I don't think they fell for it – I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> fell for it". Three wins – including a cup win over League One Stockport County and a league win at local rivals Crewe Alexandra – and three draws within four weeks saw Adams nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for October 2009. In the January 2010 transfer window he signed winger Lewis Haldane permanently, and took winger Sean Rigg and striker Craig Davies on loan. Adams' men stormed into the play-off places {{for the first time in}} the season with just two games left to play, following a 2–1 win over champions-elect Notts County. Yet with just one point from their final two games, the Vale finished the season in 10th place.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

2500|$|Mostly due to Johnson's famous guarantee, ESPN {{named the}} game {{one of the}} ten most memorable {{in the history of}} Texas Stadium in 2008. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> in a million years thought it would be this type of game", said 49ers coach George Seifert. [...] "I {{expected}} us to be more stout.

2500|$|President Obama was {{reportedly}} unhappy with U.S. intelligence agencies following {{their failure to}} foresee the 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising and the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali {{as well as the}} Egyptian protests. Responding to criticism that the State Department had failed to see the developments in Egypt coming, Clinton defended the U.S. in an interview on Al-Arabiya, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> could have predicted we'd be sitting here talking {{about the end of the}} Mubarak presidency at the time that this all started." ...|$|E
