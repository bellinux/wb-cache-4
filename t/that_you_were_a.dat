25|$|Using the Land Books (jarðarbøkur) it is speculated, {{that the}} number of {{inhabitants}} in Sørvág in the 17th century was around fifty. In the first census in the Faroes in 1801 the number of inhabitants in Sørvág had risen to a mere 86. In 1855 the number of inhabitants was 163. The reason for this slow progress is due to the special requirements for marriage, that were law in the Faroes. The law said, that in order to marry you would need to own land or have demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> faithful servant to someone who owned land. It was only the wealthy farmers who had a substantial amount of land, and therefore the birthrate in the Faroes was very low until this law was abolished.|$|E
500|$|Graduation {{opens on}} a sparse note with [...] "Good Morning", {{beginning}} with an echoed, metronomic cowbell beat and a thumping bassline melded with a simple, arpeggiating synthesizer drone. The drone is drowned {{by the music}} that arrives at the chorus, which is a conflation of ambient synths and an astral backing choir crafted from a non-verbal vocal sample of [...] "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" [...] by Elton John. [...] "Good Morning" [...] eventually concludes with the voice of Jay-Z reiterating lyrics from [...] "The Ruler's Back", the rapper's own opening track of his sixth studio album The Blueprint. The production for [...] "Champion" [...] features intermittent drops and 808-handclaps and expresses a slight jazz-rock influence, eschewing guitars and trumpets in favor of breezy synths. During the verses, West raps over a constant loop of the words [...] "their eyes" [...] while the chopped-up hook is formed from the question, [...] "Did you realize, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> champion?" [...] Both phrases are recontextualized from a line lifted from [...] "Kid Charlemagne" [...] by Steely Dan. The song also sports a reggae-inspired bridge delivered by Connie Mitchell in a distinct toasting vocal style. The soul-fired track [...] "I Wonder" [...] starts off with its piano-based refrain, which contains samples of [...] "My Song" [...] by British poet Labi Siffre. It then proceeds to morph into a myriad of interlaced synths that are impacted by distorted snare drum strokes and ethereal electronic keyboards. During the bridge, the chord progression changes and the song adopts a heavy string section that emulates the melody of its synths. The composition then enters an instrumental passage and finishes off with a sweeping string arrangement.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian noted {{an unfortunate}} {{linguistic}} problem that reduced British viewers to [...] "a state of nervous collapse" [...] due to laughter. In British English, 'bent' is a slang term for gay, with 'bender' meaning a gay man, giving {{an entirely different}} meaning to lines such as, [...] "I could tell at once <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> bender." [...] Bradshaw commented that the response from the audience to such lines was [...] "deafeningly immature" [...] and would [...] "inevitably be repeated in every cinema in the land showing The Last Airbender." ...|$|E
