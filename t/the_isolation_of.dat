40|$|Background: We {{evaluated}} <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> measures using cohorting {{rooms and}} antimicrobial use in reducing <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> rate <b>of</b> methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB). Methods: Four cohorting rooms (16 beds) for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) {{have been created}} in the general wards of our 894 -bed hospital since October 2003. We prospectively evaluated <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MRSA and MDR-AB, and amount of antimicrobial use during the 8 -year study period. We also investigated the relationship between antimicrobial use density (AUD) and <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MRSA and MDR-AB. Results: After creating cohorting rooms, <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MRSA decreased from 1. 56 cases per 1, 000 patient-days from 2004 - 2005 to 1. 24 from 2006 - 2007 (P= 0. 57). <b>The</b> <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MDR-AB also decreased from 0. 72 from 2004 - 2005 to 0. 36 from 2010 - 2011 (P＜ 0. 01). The mean quarterly AUDs of glycopeptides and carbapenems were 30. 17 ± 6. 80 and 19. 5 ± 7. 10, respectively. There were no significant correlations between AUD values and <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> rate <b>of</b> MRSA or MDR-AB. Conclusion: This study suggests that isolation measures using cohorting rooms to help limit the transmission o...|$|R

The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E

5|$|The Mérens {{may be of}} Iberian origin, as {{are most}} breeds from {{the area of the}} Pyrenees. It resembles the Norwegian Dole Gudbrandsdal and the British Fell and Dales ponies. Unlike the latter, the Mérens has never been crossed with the Friesian horse. Another theory of origin for the Mérens is based on the {{straight}} or concave facial profile (which distinguishes them from the convex-profiled Iberian horses), and asserts that they are descended from Oriental horses brought to Ariege by settlers from the east. With <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> their mountain homeland, the Mérens has undergone very little intermingling with foreign breeds.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E

5|$|Florida {{strangler}} figs (Ficus aurea) {{are common}} in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may {{be a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> certain hammocks.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; {{evaporation}} of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium.
