5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments {{that made it possible}} for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's light bulb machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.|$|E

25|$|Equally {{affected}} by consolidation and dispersal, Munsee groups moved to several locations in southern Ontario {{as early as}} the late eighteenth century, to Moraviantown, Munceytown, and Six Nations. Several different patterns of migration led to groups of Munsee speakers moving to Stockbridge, Wisconsin; Cattaraugus, New York; and Kansas. Today Munsee survives only at Moraviantown, where there are no more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> fluent speakers.|$|E

Similarly, for each group of parameters, the habitability threshold for each is to be determined. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly.

25|$|Skempton's {{style is}} characterised by a {{concentration}} on quality {{of sound and}} economy of means, absence of development in the conventional sense, and concentration on sonority. Many of his pieces are quite short, lasting no longer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> minutes. Although the compositional methods are clearly experimental, involving, for example, aleatory methods, there is a marked emphasis on the melody in many pieces. Some of his earlier piano works, such as Saltaire Melody (1977) and Trace (1980), have become favourites with the public.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to have variety in music therapy sessions. Improvisation should be conducted using more <b>than</b> just <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> methods and techniques. It is also critical to maintain flexibility during the improvisation. For example, the music therapist can preserve a flexible session flow by incorporating several methods, such as imitating, accompanying, dialoguing, and rhythmic grounding.|$|R
25|$|Since it was {{impractical}} {{to try to}} fit more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> extra guns in the constrained {{space available}} {{in the front of}} a single-engined aircraft's fuselage, this led to an increasing proportion of the armament being mounted in the wings, firing outside the arc of the propeller. There were in fact some advantages in dispensing with centrally mounted guns altogether. Nevertheless, the conclusive redundancy of synchronization gears did not finally come until the introduction of jet propulsion and the absence of a propeller for guns to be synchronized with.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publishers}} in the 1950s and '60s {{refused to}} publish more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> books {{a year by}} the same author. Louis's editor at Gold Medal supported his writing up {{to three or four}} but the heads of the company vetoed that idea even though Louis was publishing books with other houses. Louis had sold over a dozen novels and several million copies before Bantam Books editor-in-chief Saul David was finally able to convince his company to offer Louis a short term exclusive contract that would accept three books a year. It was only after 1960, however, that Louis's sales at Bantam would begin to surpass his sales at Gold Medal.|$|E

At that time league officials asked former Green Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr to help find a new ownership group in Alabama. On September 17, 1992, the NFL decided to place the WLAF on an indefinite hiatus. The owners stated that {{the decision was made}} to shutter the league at that time in an effort to save money to settle potential class action lawsuits brought about by players in the wake of Plan B free agency being declared illegal. The NFL stated that when the league was reestablished it would be focused on European markets with no more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> teams envisioned for play in the United States.|$|E

40|$|By far {{the most}} popular form of word play is the pun. Linguists who prefer big words call his paronomasia. What {{it boils down to}} is a word, phrase, or idiomatic {{expression}} with more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> meaning, <b>or</b> <b>two</b> words with the same sound but different meanings. The humor comes when you expect a word to mean something but it turns out unexpectedly to mean something else...|$|R
25|$|The label's biggest early star, soul singer Otis Redding, also {{arrived in}} 1962. Redding, however, {{technically}} {{was not on}} Stax, but on its sister label Volt. In that era, many radio stations, anxious to avoid even the hint of payola, often refused to play more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> new songs from any single record label at one time, so as to {{not appear to be}} offering favoritism to any particular label. To circumvent this, Stax, like many other record companies, created a number of subsidiary labels. Volt, founded in late 1961, was the label home to Otis Redding, the Bar-Kays, {{and a handful of other}} artists. Volt releases were initially issued by Atlantic through its subsidiary Atco Records. Other Stax subsidiaries over the years included Enterprise, Chalice (a gospel label), Hip, and Safice.|$|E
25|$|This {{decline in}} {{productivity}} is essentially {{due to the}} redirection of the pelagic network to a benthic chain by this one species. Because the Amur River clam feeds on primary producers, consumers and predators, it impacts multiple trophic levels. Consequently, nearly all plankton exhibit signs of apparent competition, in that production at one trophic level impacts all others by increasing clam abundance. This results in a negative feedback loop: C. amurensis limits plankton biomass, which in turn limits C. amurensis. However, inputs from outside the system due to tidal advection or upstream sources may increase C. amurensis biomass, further driving plankton limitation. This feedback loop is further amplified because the clam may persist for more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> years, which puts added pressure on plankton populations during cycles of low productivity.|$|E
25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel {{on one side of the}} body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world is spinning, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E

X-23 is a highly trained and skilled combatant; she is able to kill dozens of heavily armed opponents during a single encounter.|$|R
25|$|Tyre {{selection}} is critical, usually {{done by the}} individual rider based on bike 'feel' during practice, qualifying and the pre-race warm-up laps {{on the morning of}} the race, as well as the predicted weather. The typical compromise is between grip and longevity—softer compound tyres have more traction, but wear out more quickly; harder compound tyres have less traction, but are more likely to last the entire race. Conserving rubber throughout a race is a specific skill winning riders acquire. Special 'Q' or qualifying tyres of extreme softness and grip were typically used during grid-qualifying sessions until their use was discontinued at the end of the 2008 season, but they lasted typically no longer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> laps, though they could deliver higher qualifying speeds. In wet conditions, special tires ('wets') with full treads are used, but they suffer extreme wear if the track dries out.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} single achievement among pitchers is {{a perfect}} game, which has been accomplished 23 times in over 135 years, most recently by Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2012. By definition, a perfect game is counted as a shutout. A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score {{through a series of}} errors, base on balls, catcher's interferences, dropped third strikes, or hit batsmen. The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson, who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907–1927. He accumulated 110 shutouts, which is 20 more than the second place leader, Pete Alexander. The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball, because pitchers today rarely earn more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching. Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers.|$|E

30|$|Previous study {{reported}} that the cancer preventing action {{of fruits and vegetables}} is most probably due to the several bioactive compounds that act simultaneously to prevent cancer rather <b>than</b> being <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> potent anticarcinogens (Tomás-Barberán and Gil 2008). As chemopreventive agents, phytochemicals can interfere in different step of carcinogenesis (promotion, initiation and progression) by two major actions; cancer blocking agents and cancer suppressing agent (Surh 2003). Some chemopreventive phytochemicals inhibit the metabolic action of the pre-carcinogens, consequently block the tumor initiation.|$|R

500|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the peoples who would constitute the core of the Betsimisaraka were organized into numerous clans under the authority of chiefs (filohany) who each typically ruled over no more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> villages. Those around Antongil Bay in the north held a comparatively more official position, with regalia of leadership attested since at least 1500. The presence of natural bays along the northern coastline that became the port towns of Antongil, Titingue, Foulpointe, Fenerive and Tamatave favored the economic and political development of the Antavaratra Betsimisaraka; the southern portion of this coastline, by contrast, lacked any areas suitable for ports. Villagers in the areas surrounding the ports exported rice, cattle, slaves and other goods to the nearby Mascarene Islands. The eastern ports' strategic position for regional trade attracted the heaviest settlement of Europeans to this portion of the island, particularly including British and American pirates whose numbers dramatically increased from the 1680s to the 1720s along the coast from modern day Antsiranana in the north to Nosy Boraha and Foulpointe to the east. Intermarriage between these European pirates and the daughters of local chiefs produced a large mixed population termed zana-malata.|$|E
