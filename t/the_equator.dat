The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, a small {{low-level}} circulation {{was located}} along the northwest coastline of Borneo; {{at the same}} time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the South China Sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the Far East. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by December 21. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and {{at the same time}} a portion of the air surge crossed <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north of <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> By December 25, an area of scattered convection persisted about 370km (230mi) east of Singapore within an area of low wind shear, in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further, and at 1200UTC on December 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230km (145mi) east of Singapore, or 156km (97mi) north of <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{observer}} {{standing on}} <b>the</b> Earth's <b>equator</b> visualizes <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> as a semicircle passing directly overhead through the zenith. As the observer moves north (or south), <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> tilts towards <b>the</b> opposite horizon. <b>The</b> celestial <b>equator</b> is defined to be infinitely distant (since {{it is on}} the celestial sphere); thus the observer always sees the ends of the semicircle disappear over the horizon exactly due east and due west, regardless of the observer's position on Earth. (At the poles, though, <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> would be parallel to the horizon.) At all latitudes <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> appears perfectly straight because the observer is only finitely far from the plane of <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> but infinitely far from <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|An old term, right {{ascension}} (Latin, ascensio recta)refers to the ascension, or the point on <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> which rises with any celestial object, {{as seen from}} <b>the</b> Earth's <b>equator,</b> where <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> intersects <b>the</b> horizon at a right angle.It is contrasted with oblique ascension, the point on <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> which rises with a celestial object as seen from almost anywhere else on Earth, where <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> intersects <b>the</b> horizon at an oblique angle.|$|R

5|$|Vamei {{formed and}} reached {{tropical}} storm strength at 1.5ºN, only 156km (97mi) from <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> This broke {{the previous record}} of Typhoon Sarah in the 1956 Pacific typhoon season, which reached tropical storm strength at 2.2ºN. Due {{to a lack of}} Coriolis effect near <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> the formation of Vamei was previously considered impossible. However, a study by the Naval Postgraduate School indicated that the probability for a similar equatorial development was at least once every four centuries.|$|E

30|$|Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008) {{discussed}} how the Esb is transported toward <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> but is stopped from further advancement to <b>the</b> dip <b>equator.</b> We use this model for interpretation of scintillations {{that occur in}} the vicinity of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator.</b>|$|R
5|$|This adds a {{periodic}} component {{to the position}} of the equinoxes; the positions of <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> and (vernal) equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called <b>the</b> true <b>equator</b> and equinox; <b>the</b> positions without nutation are <b>the</b> mean <b>equator</b> and equinox.|$|R
30|$|According to the Tsunoda model (Tsunoda 2008), Esb patch {{is stopped}} from further {{advancement}} to <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> by <b>the</b> {{presence of the}} vertical Ep that drives the EEJ.

5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at <b>the</b> <b>equator</b> the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E

50|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator,</b> known as nutation.This adds a periodic component {{to the position of}} the equinoxes; the positions of <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> and (vernal) equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called <b>the</b> true <b>equator</b> and equinox; <b>the</b> positions without nutation are <b>the</b> mean <b>equator</b> and equinox.|$|R
30|$|We, however, {{have found}} that {{scintillation}} is observed over <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> and that {{it appears to be}} rare. We shall address this problem with this new interpretation. In fact, the new interpretation shows how Esb patches can further advance to <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> and explains how scintillation could occur over <b>the</b> dip <b>equator.</b>|$|R
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to <b>the</b> <b>equator</b> have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from <b>the</b> <b>equator.</b> Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5000|$|The {{declination}} symbol , (lower case [...] "delta", abbreviated dec) {{measures the}} angular distance {{of an object}} perpendicular to <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator,</b> positive to <b>the</b> north, negative to the south. For example, the north celestial pole has a declination of +90°. The origin for declination is <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator,</b> which is <b>the</b> projection of <b>the</b> Earth's <b>equator</b> onto <b>the</b> celestial sphere.

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Central African Republic is {{situated}} {{just north of}} <b>the</b> <b>Equator</b> with daily temperatures normally reaching at least 30 degrees Celsius.

While the warm season is from 23 January to 18 March, the cold season lasts from 20 June to 27 August, when rainfall is frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. The city is bordered by thick tropical rainforests along the river banks. Several of its neighbourhoods are in low-lying areas prone to recurrent flooding. Severe rains in June and July 2009 left 11,000 people homeless.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The {{equatorial}} {{coordinate system}} using spherical coordinates. The fundamental plane is formed by projection of Earth's <b>equator</b> onto <b>the</b> celestial sphere, forming <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> (blue). <b>The</b> primary direction is established by projecting Earth's orbit onto the celestial sphere, forming the ecliptic (red), {{and setting up}} the ascending node of the ecliptic on <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator,</b> forming <b>the</b> vernal equinox. Right ascension is measured eastward along <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator</b> from <b>the</b> equinox, and declination is measured positive northward from <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator.</b> (Two such coordinate pairs are shown here.)

50|$|These {{concepts}} {{are important for}} understanding celestial coordinate systems - frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include <b>the</b> Earth's <b>equator,</b> axis, and <b>the</b> Earth's orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator,</b> <b>the</b> north and south celestial poles and the ecliptic, respectively. As the celestial sphere is considered infinite in radius, all observers see <b>the</b> celestial <b>equator,</b> celestial poles and ecliptic {{at the same place}} against the background stars.|$|R
5|$|The {{break-up}} {{velocity of}} a star is an expression {{that is used to}} describe the case where the centrifugal force at <b>the</b> <b>equator</b> is equal to the gravitational force. For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to <b>the</b> <b>equator,</b> an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E

30|$|The secular {{trends of}} the {{vertical}} component (Z) {{for the six}} Indian stations for quiet day annual means is shown in Fig. 3 (c). The Z-field decreased since 1958, reaching a minimum value around 1970, and then it increased again. The increase in Z from 1970 is more rapid at equatorial stations (denoting the southward migration of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator)</b> as compared with mid-latitude stations. The southward migration of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> was suggested by Srivastava (1992) and confirmed by Rangarajan and Deka (1991). The maximum speed of the southward migration of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> {{is estimated to be}} ~ 5 km/year during 1980 – 1990 (Deka et al., 2005). The southward migration of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> is also shown in Fig. 1 for different years from 1975 to 2005. Srivastava and Abbas (1977) have found a quasi-periodicity of ~ 80 years in the migration of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator.</b> In our analysis, the Z-field also completes a half-cycle in 40 years; hence, the period of the secular change of the position of <b>the</b> dip <b>equator</b> is of <b>the</b> order of ~ 80 years, attributable to the Gleissberg cycle (Gleissberg, 1965).|$|R
