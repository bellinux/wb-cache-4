500|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable resident, however, is Mary Elizabeth Wilson; a serial killer who {{achieved}} worldwide notoriety as the [...] "Merry Widow of Windy Nook". Wilson was born in Hebburn but lived with her first husband John Knowles, along with her lover, John Russell {{in the same house}} at Windy Nook for 43 years. Knowles died in 1955 and she married Russell five months later. He died two years later and both were attributed to natural causes. Wilson remarried again but her third marriage, to Oliver Leonard, lasted just twelve days and he died leaving £50 to his wife in his will. [...] A short time later, Wilson married for a fourth time to Ernest Wilson. At her wedding reception, Wilson joked to a guest that the sandwiches left over could be saved for the funeral. When Ernest died soon after, Wilson joked with the funeral director that she should be offered a <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> for all of the trade she passed his way. Local residents heard of these comment and began speculating as to the spate of deaths, so that Police eventually exhumed Oliver Leonard and Ernest Wilson in 1958 and found traces of phosphorus caused by rat poison. Despite claiming that sexual stimulation pills were the source of the phosphorus, Wilson was convicted of both murders at Leeds in 1958 and sentenced to hang at Durham; the last woman to be so sentenced. Due to her age, her execution was commuted to a life sentence, and she died in Holloway prison in 1962. A later exhumation of her first two husbands also resulted in phosphorus being found, but Wilson died before she could be tried again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discount}} {{described as}} trade rate discount {{is sometimes called}} [...] "trade discount".Trade discount is the discount allowed on retail price of a product or something. for e.g. Retail price of a cream is 25 and <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> is 2% on 25.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the <b>Trade</b> <b>discount,</b> this is {{used when}} the seller wishes to improve cash flow or liquidity, but {{finds that the}} buyer {{typically}} is unable to meet the desired discount deadline.

50|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>discounts,</b> {{also called}} {{functional}} discounts, are payments to distribution channel members for performing some function. Examples of these functions are warehousing and shelf stocking. <b>Trade</b> <b>discounts</b> are often combined {{to include a}} series of functions, for example 20/12/5 could indicate a 20% discount for warehousing the product, an additional 12% discount for shipping the product, and an additional 5% discount for keeping the shelves stocked. <b>Trade</b> <b>discounts</b> are most frequent in industries where retailers hold {{the majority of the}} power in the distribution channel (referred to as channel captains).|$|R

50|$|By {{this time}} Wilson {{had become a}} main figure of local gossip, {{concerning}} both the frequency at which her spouses died and her rather cheerful attitude towards the pattern; she had joked at her latest wedding reception that left-over sandwiches would be fresh enough {{to use in the}} next funeral.

50|$|The {{collapse}} of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s and the following Lost Decade helped to open inbound <b>trade.</b> <b>Discount</b> markets opened the distribution chains, and several companies turned to foreign trade and investment to avoid losses and even bankruptcy. Products of Japanese companies that were manufactured in South-Asian countries were reimported at lower prices. The Japanese consumer also changed: Economic problems forced many Japanese to look for cheap prices first and care about national pride or superior quality later.|$|E

5000|$|A trade rate discount, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} [...] "trade discount", {{is offered by}} a seller to a buyer for purposes of trade or reselling, rather than to an end user. For example, a pharmacist might offer a discount for over-the-counter drugs to physicians who are purchasing them for dispensing to the physicians' own patients. A seller supplying both trade or resellers, {{and the general public}} will have a general list price for anybody, and will offer a <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> to bona-fide trade customers.|$|E
50|$|The {{supplier}} has his invoices paid earlier; {{therefore he}} {{can more easily}} manage his cashflow, and reduce {{by the way the}} costs of his receivables management. Moreover, as it is the ordering party that puts his liability at stake, he benefits of a better interest on the <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> than the one he would have obtained by going himself to a factoring company.The reverse factoring is very useful for small companies who have for clients large groups, because it creates a more durable business relation as the big company helps the smaller one, and doing so gets some extra money.In a factoring process, if there is any problem concerning the payment of the invoice, it is the supplier that is liable, and has to give back the money he received. In the reverse factoring process, as it concerns validated invoices, as soon as the supplier receives the payment from the factor, he is protected. The factor will have to get his money from the ordering party.Finally, in a <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> system, the supplier is forced to be paid cash, regardless of his cash flow. Some reverse factoring platforms identified this problem, and therefore propose to the suppliers a more collaborative solution: they choose themselves the invoices they want to receive cash, the others will be paid at due date.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with pricing issues facing manufacturers when retailers offer periodic discounts and customers stockpile in response. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the dissertation. In Chapter 2, we study a new Pareto-improving pricing scheme in which the manufacturer subsidizes the retailer's setup (transportation) cost in exchange for a (possibly) higher wholesale price. The retailer responds by choosing regular and discount prices and his order frequency to maximize his revenue less setup, purchasing and inventory holding costs, considering the customers' response. There are two customer segments that differ in their reservation prices and inventory holding costs. Customers make purchasing (including stockpiling) decisions to maximize their utility from consumption less purchasing and inventory holding costs. We characterize the retailer's optimal response to the manufacturer's pricing decisions and the consumers' response to the retailer's pricing schemes. We then show how to solve the manufacturer's decision problem in view of the downstream responses. In Chapter 3, we investigate the retailer's pass [...] through of manufacturer trade discounts. The manufacturer offers a fixed wholesale price and periodic trade discounts. The retailer optimizes his ordering plan (including stockpiling when a <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> is offered) and the pattern of discounts to offer to customers, seeking to maximize revenue less setup, purchasing and inventory holding costs. Customers differ in their reservation prices, and in our model, we account for the adverse effect of retail discounts on consumers' reservation prices. For a given frequency and depth of the manufacturer's <b>trade</b> <b>discount,</b> we characterize the retailer's optimal discounting pattern for a given ordering schedule that spans the time between the manufacturer's <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> offers. We solve for the retailer's jointly optimal ordering and discounting patterns by enumerating appropriate ordering schedules and optimizing the retailer's discount pattern for each. For the models in Chapters 2 and 3, we also perform associated numerical studies which, together with our analytical results, provide insight into how both manufacturers and retailers should make decisions in these problem settings, and circumstances in which various policiesare most effective in increasing profit. Chapter 4 concludes the dissertation with a summary of contributions and key findings...|$|E
40|$|An {{engineering}} {{economic model}} showed that corn cleaning can produce net benefits of $. 01 to $. 03 cents per bushel, provided that corn {{with an initial}} broken corn foreign material (BCFM) content of 3 % or greater is stored {{for at least three}} months. The model, which included five operational costs and nine potential benefits, gave results in close agreement with USDA survey data. Capture of benefits requires considerable operator skill, and elevators with larger volumes relative to cleaner cost can benefit more readily. Net benefits are independent of changes in corn grade standards or <b>trade</b> <b>discount</b> factors. Although the exact cost-benefit calculations are individually case-sensitive, the separation of BCFM into two factors will not greatly increase the incentives to clean for any reasonable set of cost inputs...|$|E
