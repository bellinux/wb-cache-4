500|$|Emily Estep of WeGotThisCovered.com {{ranked the}} episode [...] 5 on her [...] "Top 10 Episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants" [...] list. She said [...] "While Rock Bottom {{is mostly a}} goofy episode, it's {{also one of the}} scarier episodes of SpongeBob." [...] She also said the episode has [...] "the ideal balance of cuteness and sheer terror â€“ like SpongeBob running from a mysterious character, saying, 'Well, that place will be <b>there</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> I guess I'd better keep walking. Running. Better start running. Running. Sprinting! Yes, I just gotta keep sprinting!' (Before he hits a wall; 'Sitting, sitting, bleeding.')" [...] that made the episode [...] "so well-remembered." [...] Bill Treadway of DVD Talk gave the episode a 3 out of 5 rating.|$|E
500|$|Longstreet's actions at the Battle of Gettysburg {{would become}} the {{centerpiece}} of the controversy that surrounded him for over a century. Ahead of his troops he arrived on the battlefield late in the afternoon of the first day, July 1, 1863. By then, two Union corps had been driven by Ewell and Hill back through the town into defensive positions on Cemetery Hill. Lee had not intended to fight before his army was fully concentrated, but chance and questionable decisions by A.P. Hill brought on the battle, which- on the first day- was an impressive Confederate victory. Meeting with Lee, Longstreet was concerned about the strength of the Union defensive position and advocated a strategic movement around the left flank of the enemy, to [...] "secure good ground between him and his capital," [...] which would presumably compel the Union commander, Maj. Gen. George Meade, to attack defensive positions erected by the Confederates. Instead, Lee exclaimed, [...] "If the enemy is <b>there</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> we must attack him." ...|$|E

Well, we knew this when we founded the club; but we noticed that the woman at the bottom of it was always a womanly woman. The unwomanly women who work for their living and know {{how to take care of}} {{themselves}} never give any trouble. So we simply said we wouldn't have any womanly women; and when one gets smuggled in she has to take care not to behave in a womanly way. We get on all right. (He rises.)
