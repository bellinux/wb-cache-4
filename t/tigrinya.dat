Of these, {{approximately}} 4,320,000 inhabit Ethiopia, with most {{concentrated in the}} Tigray region. <b>Tigrinya</b> speakers in Eritrea number around 2,540,000 individuals, and are centered in the southern and central areas. There are also over 10,000 Beta Israel speakers of <b>Tigrinya.</b>|$|E
25|$|Italian Eritreans also {{speak the}} country's de facto {{official}} languages <b>Tigrinya,</b> Arabic, and English. The assimilated Italian Eritreans {{of the new}} generations (in 2007 they numbered nearly 900 persons) speak <b>Tigrinya</b> and only a bit of Italian or speak Italian as second language.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, <b>Tigrinya</b> has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken <b>Tigrinya</b> from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, it is harder to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E

25|$|In Ethiopia, <b>Tigrinya</b> is {{the third}} most spoken language. The Tigray {{constitute}} the fourth largest ethnic group in the country after the Oromo, Amhara and Somali, who also speak Afro-Asiatic languages. In Eritrea, <b>Tigrinya</b> {{is by far the}} most spoken language, where it is used by around 55% of the population. Tigre is used by around 30% of residents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} classical Ethiopian Semitic language Ge'ez by having phrasal verbs {{and using a}} word-order that places the main verb last instead of first in the sentence. There is a strong Ge'ez influence on <b>Tigrinya</b> literature, especially with terms that relate to Christian life, Biblical names, and so on. Ge'ez, because of its status within Ethiopian culture, acted as a literary medium until relatively recent times. Aside from Ge’ez, <b>Tigrinya</b> itself has had development into the press as the language was incorporated in a ministry newspaper that was published by the British administration of Eritrea. It sold 5000 copies weekly and was at the affordable price of five cents and it {{was reported to be}} {{the first of its kind}} in the region. However, The earliest written example of <b>Tigrinya</b> is a text of local laws found in Logosarda district, Southern Region, Eritrea and in northern Ethiopia, which dates from the 13th century during the reign of the Zagwe dynasty. However, the phonology of the <b>Tigrinya</b> language along with the morphology still strongly shows the connection to the predecessor language of Ge'ez while the connection also displays Tigriniya's semitic character.|$|E
2500|$|Eritrea is a {{multi-ethnic}} country, {{with nine}} recognized {{ethnic groups in}} its population of around [...] million. Most residents speak languages from the Afroasiatic family, either of the Ethiopian Semitic languages or Cushitic branches. Among these communities, the <b>Tigrinyas</b> make up about 55% of the population, with the Tigre people constituting around 30% of inhabitants. In addition, {{there are a number}} of Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nilotic ethnic minorities. Most people in the territory adhere to Christianity or Islam.|$|R
50|$|The {{nation has}} nine {{recognized}} ethnic groups. According to SIL Ethnologue, <b>Tigrinyas</b> {{make up about}} 50% of the population; the Tigre, who also speak a Ethiopic language, constitute around 30% of residents. Most {{of the rest of}} the population belong to other Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch. Additionally, there are a number of Arabic, Nilo-Saharan and Italian-speaking ethnic minorities. A majority of Eritrea's population adheres to Abrahamic religions. The two most followed religions are Christianity and Islam, which have an almost equal number of followers.|$|R
25|$|The Tigrayans and <b>Tigrinyas</b> are {{descendants}} of early Semitic-speaking peoples whose {{presence in the}} region dates back to at least 2000 BC, based on linguistic evidence (and known from the 9th century BC from inscriptions). According to Ethiopian traditions, the Tigrayan nobility; i.e. that of the Tigray province of Ethiopia, trace their ancestry to the legendary king Menelik I, the child born of the queen of Sheba and King Solomon as do the priests of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Ge'ez ካህን kāhin). Menelik I would become the first king of the Solomonic dynasty of rulers of Ethiopia that ended only with the deposing of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.|$|R
25|$|James Bruce in {{his book}} {{published}} in 1805 located Tigré(a region based arbitrarily by James Bruce on the Language of <b>Tigrinya)</b> between Red Sea and the Tekezé River and stated many large governments, such as Enderta and Antalow, and the great part of Baharhagash were part of Tigré region based on the language of <b>Tigrinya.</b>|$|E
25|$|For Ge'ez, Amharic, <b>Tigrinya</b> and Tigre, {{the usual}} sort order is called halehame (h–l–ħ–m). Where the labiovelar {{variants}} are used, these come {{immediately after the}} basic consonant and are followed by other variants. In <b>Tigrinya,</b> for example, the letters based on ከ come in this order: ከ, ኰ, ኸ, ዀ. In Blin, the sorting order is slightly different.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya,</b> {{along with}} Modern Standard Arabic, {{is one of}} Eritrea's two {{official}} languages.|$|E
25|$|Today, Ge'ez remains only as {{the main}} {{language}} used in the liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Beta Israel Jewish community. However, in Ethiopia, Amharic (the main lingua franca of modern Ethiopia) or other local languages, and in Eritrea and Tigray Region in Ethiopia, <b>Tigrinya</b> {{may be used for}} sermons. Amharic, <b>Tigrinya,</b> and Tigre are closely related to Ge'ez. Some linguists do not believe that Ge'ez constitutes the common ancestor of modern Ethiopian languages, but that Ge'ez became a separate language early on from some hypothetical, completely unattested language, and can thus be seen as an extinct sister language of Amharic, Tigre and <b>Tigrinya.</b> The foremost Ethiopian experts such as Amsalu Aklilu point to the vast proportion of inherited nouns that are unchanged, and even spelled identically in both Ge'ez and Amharic (and to a lesser degree, <b>Tigrinya).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> dialects are {{typically}} split into Northern and Southern sections, which differ phonetically, lexically, and grammatically.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> dialects differ phonetically, lexically, and grammatically. No dialect {{appears to}} be {{accepted}} as a standard.|$|E

25|$|Like other Semitic languages, <b>Tigrinya</b> has object pronoun suffixes {{that can}} appear on verbs in any tense-aspect-mood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> {{is closely}} related to Amharic and Tigre, another Afroasiatic {{language}} spoken by the Tigre people as well as many Beja. <b>Tigrinya</b> and Tigre although close are not mutually intelligible, and while <b>Tigrinya</b> has traditionally been written using the same Ge'ez alphabet (fidel) as Amharic, Tigre has been transcribed mainly using the Arabic script. Attempts by the Eritrean government to have Tigre written using the Ge'ez script has met with some resistance from the predominantly Muslim Tigre people who associate Ge'ez with the Orthodox Church and would prefer the Arabic or the more neutral Latin alphabet. It has also met with the linguistic difficulty of the Ge'ez script being a syllabic system which does not distinguish long vowels from short ones. While this works well for writing <b>Tigrinya</b> or Amharic, which do not rely on vowel length in words, it does complicate writing Tigre, where vowel length sometimes distinguishes one word and its meaning from another. The Ge'ez script evolved from the Epigraphic South Arabian script, whose first inscriptions are from the 8th century BC in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Yemen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> is {{the fourth}} most spoken {{language}} in Ethiopia after Amharic, Oromo, Somali and the most widely spoken language in Eritrea (see languages). It is also spoken by large immigrant communities around the world, in countries including Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In Australia, <b>Tigrinya</b> {{is one of the}} languages broadcast on public radio via the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{otherwise}} indicated, <b>Tigrinya</b> verbs in {{this article}} are given in the usual citation form, the third person singular masculine perfect.|$|E
25|$|Gemination, the {{doubling}} of a consonantal sound, is phonemic in <b>Tigrinya,</b> i.e. {{it affects the}} meaning of words. While gemination {{plays an important role}} in the morphology of the <b>Tigrinya</b> verb, it is normally accompanied by other marks. But there is a small number of pairs of words which are only differentiable from each other by gemination, e.g. , ('he brought forth'); , ('he came closer'). All the consonants, with the exception of the pharyngeal and glottal, can be geminated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> {{is written}} in the Ge'ez script (Ethiopic script), which was {{originally}} developed for the Ge'ez language. The Ge'ez script is an abugida. Each symbol represents a consonant+vowel syllable, and the symbols are organized in groups of similar symbols {{on the basis of}} both the consonant and the vowel. In the table below the columns are assigned to the seven vowels of <b>Tigrinya</b> (and Ge'ez); they appear in the traditional order. The rows are assigned to the consonants, again in the traditional order.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tigrinya</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the related Tigre language. The latter is spoken by the Tigre people, who inhabit the lowland regions of Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} modern ES languages, the default word order in clauses is subject–object–verb, and noun {{modifiers}} usually (though {{not always in}} <b>Tigrinya)</b> precede their head nouns.|$|E
25|$|The Christian Tigrinyas {{along with}} some Muslim Djiberti <b>Tigrinya</b> and Saho live in the central and {{southern}} highlands. The eastern lowlands are inhabited by the Afar, the Rashaida {{along with some}} of the Saho and Tigre. The border formed between the western lowlands and the central highlands are the home to the Bilen who are concentrated in the Keren area. The area is also home to a large minority of Tigre and <b>Tigrinya.</b> The western lowlands are home to the Beja, Kunama, Nara and the majority of Tigre.|$|E
25|$|Eritrea's {{ethnic groups}} each {{have their own}} styles of music and {{accompanying}} dances. Amongst the <b>Tigrinya,</b> the best known traditional musical genre is the guaila. Traditional instruments of Eritrean folk music include the stringed krar, kebero, begena, masenqo and the wata (a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin). A popular Eritrean artist is the <b>Tigrinya</b> singer Helen Meles, who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range. Other prominent local musicians include the Kunama singer Dehab Faytinga, Ruth Abraha, Bereket Mengisteab, the late Yemane Baria, and the late Abraham Afewerki.|$|E
25|$|Ge'ez or Ethiopic {{has been}} {{computerized}} and assigned Unicode 3.0 codepoints between U+1200 and U+137F (decimal 4608–4991), containing the basic syllable signs for Ge'ez, Amharic, and <b>Tigrinya,</b> punctuation and numerals.|$|E
25|$|Like other Ethiopian Semitic languages, <b>Tigrinya</b> has a copula ('be') and a {{separate}} verb of existence and location ('exist, be located'), neither of which is conjugated like other verbs.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is unusual}} for allophones to be {{represented}} with distinct symbols in the written form of a language, these latter phones are distinguished in <b>Tigrinya</b> orthography. Tigriniya's predecessor language of Ge'ez also follows this unique allophonic system.|$|E
25|$|Baking is done {{either on}} a {{specialized}} electric stove, or more commonly, on a large, black clay plate over a fire. This set-up is a stove called a mitad (ምጣድ) (in Amharic) or mogogo (ሞጎጎ) (in <b>Tigrinya).</b>|$|E
25|$|Ge'ez {{is written}} with Ethiopic or the Ge'ez abugida, a script that was {{originally}} developed specifically for this language. In languages that use it, such as Amharic and <b>Tigrinya,</b> the script is called , which means script or alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{linked to}} the peninsular {{homeland}} of Old South Arabian, of which only one language, Razihi, remains, Ethiopia and Eritrea contain {{a substantial number of}} Semitic languages; the most widely spoken are Amharic in Ethiopia, Tigre in Eritrea, and <b>Tigrinya</b> in both. Amharic is the official language of Ethiopia. <b>Tigrinya</b> is a working language in Eritrea. Tigre is spoken by over one million people in the northern and central Eritrean lowlands and parts of eastern Sudan. A number of Gurage languages are spoken by populations in the semi-mountainous region of southwest Ethiopia, while Harari is restricted to the city of Harar. Ge'ez remains the liturgical language for certain groups of Christians in Ethiopia and in Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|Ethnolinguistically, Tigrayans {{are related}} to the Tigrinyas of Eritrea, both of whom speak <b>Tigrinya,</b> an Ethiopian Semitic {{language}} belonging to the Afroasiatic family.
