25|$|In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began a major {{refurbishment}} of the White House that included <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Room.</b> Her renovation was technically overseen by an advisory Committee on Fine Arts {{made up of}} museum professionals as well as wealthy individuals interested in antiques. American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont (an expert in Federal furniture) led this committee. Mrs. Kennedy also brought in French interior designer Stéphane Boudin (an advocate of French interior design) and his company, Maison Jansen, to oversee the refurbishment. Although du Pont and Boudin often competed with one another for control of redecoration of a space in the White House, <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Room</b> represents an area where they cooperated more closely. This was because <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Room</b> {{had a long history}} as a Federal-style room, an area in which du Pont and his committee were experts. <b>The</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Room</b> was the first room in the White House to be redesigned almost completely with the input of the committee.|$|E
