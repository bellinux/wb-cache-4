Suppose that player 1 loses in the original game. Then, the tree corresponding to a play is well-founded. Therefore, player 2 can win <b>the</b> <b>auxiliary</b> game by using auxiliary moves based on the indiscernibles (since the order type of indiscernibles exceeds the Kleene-Brouwer order of the tree), which contradicts player 1 winning <b>the</b> <b>auxiliary</b> game.|$|R
