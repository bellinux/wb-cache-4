He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea about the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are not, {{and that we can}} only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E

Ironically, the Sena itself was given a 'protected childhood' in the late 1960s by the then Congress {{as a tool to}} war with the Communist Party of India, which had a strong presence in Mumbai. Not surprisingly, covertly the administration has provided Raj adequate platform to consolidate the political forum through an emotive Marathi plank. The purpose is to split the 26% [...] Marathi voters in Mumbai, which is rather loyal to the Shiv Sena. The electoral merit of the MNS remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of the soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Pune." [...] She further noted, [...] "Under chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the Congress sees a double advantage in the strategy: A proactive MNS will divide Sena voters {{on the one hand and}} drive Mumbai’s North Indian community— which was being targeted as [...] "outsiders" [...] by the MNS— to Congress’s lap. North Indians, who dominate 48 essential services in Mumbai, constitute a sizeable— and hence decisive— vote bank. Forget political will, it is well-calculated political design which has withheld the Democratic Front government from taking stern action against Raj. Or else, how does one explain home minister RR Patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets?" [...] She also said, [...] "(Vilasrao) Deshmukh is no better. He has often said, [...] "My administration will not tolerate divisive forces. Nobody is above the law"." [...] She expressed her views in reference to, Bombay High Court on lashing out at the Maharashtra government over the threat given by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena about displaying the Marathi signboard on the shops and establishments in the metropolis.

60|$|It {{is obvious}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> {{expect to find}} the law of a {{tendency}} by an induction from {{cases in which the}} tendency is counteracted. The laws of motion could never have been brought to light from the observation of bodies kept at rest by the equilibrium of opposing forces. Even where the tendency is not, in the ordinary sense of the word, counteracted, but only modified, by having its effects compounded with the effects arising from some other tendency or tendencies, we are still in an unfavorable position for tracing, by means of such cases, the law of the tendency itself. It would have been scarcely possible to discover the law that every body in motion tends to continue moving in a straight line, by an induction from instances in which the motion is deflected into a curve, by being compounded with the effect of an accelerating force. Notwithstanding the resources afforded in this description of cases by the Method of Concomitant Variations, the principles of a judicious experimentation prescribe that the law of each of the tendencies should be studied, if possible, in cases in which that tendency operates alone, or in combination with no agencies but those of which the effect can, from previous knowledge, be calculated and allowed for.|$|E
