[...] In 1995, the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "With its finely restored interior and turn-of-the-century architecture, old Fire Station 23 in Downtown Los Angeles {{is one of}} the choicest filming locations in town." [...] One producer called it [...] "a great raw architectural space <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> a lot with." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie himself remembered {{almost nothing}} of the album's production, not even the studio, later admitting, [...] "I know it was in LA because I've read it was". The singer {{was not alone in}} his use of cocaine during the sessions, Carlos Alomar commenting, [...] "if there's a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> your guitar part, you do the line of coke... the coke use is driven by the inspiration." [...] Like Bowie, Earl Slick had {{somewhat}} vague memories of the recording: [...] "That album's a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights." ...|$|E

[...] Received by Cornwallis on September 14, this letter may have been {{instrumental}} in the decision by Cornwallis to remain at Yorktown and not try to fight his way out, despite the urging of Banastre Tarleton to break out against the comparatively weak Lafayette. [...] The British military leadership in New York held a council on September 17 in which they agreed that Cornwallis could not be reinforced until they had regained control of the Chesapeake. [...] Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis [...] "dangling in the wind." [...] One day earlier, Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help: [...] "I am of the opinion <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> me no effectual service but by coming directly to this place."

500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

We’re showing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> Ralph Ellison at the same times as you’re doing Chester Himes." [...] Coker was as specific with his choices of music in the season as [...] "Martin Scorsese is with the rock 'n' roll references like in Casino or in Goodfellas", rather than just adding hip-hop music for the sake of it. He highlighted the use of [...] "I'm Bad Like Jesse James" [...] in the seventh episode, which he had been trying to use in something for 20 years, that [...] "builds up and coincides with the explosion that happens on screen and it’s so subtle. That’s the kind of stuff I geek out over." ...|$|E

Do people in China, which accounts for a fifth of the world's population, and the Buddhists, who account for another fifth—among others—really want the U.S. and its client states to bomb the Serbs or Iraqis? And who exactly, and when, deputed the U.S. to act on behalf of this 'world community'? ... Secondly, can the blunt weapon of force, of whose use U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright boasted, balance conflicting and competing ethnic, religious, economic and political interactions over this wide and conflictive region? Can the U.S. raise the expectations of the Albanians and Slav Moslems without affronting Macedonians, Greeks, Italians, Bulgars and Croats, as well as Serbs? ... Thirdly, can force be a substitute for policy? It was a wise German who said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything with bayonets except sit on them. The same goes for gunships, the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy. Bomb and rocket once, and it has an effect.
