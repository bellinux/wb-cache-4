"Although {{the right}} of silence, in {{contrast}} to the right to counsel, can be exercised passively (by not speaking), a suspect’s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview. A suspect may want to listen to a recitation of the evidence against him or learn about the benefits of cooperation before deciding whether to exercise his rights. Or a suspect may be formulating an explanation of events that lessens his culpability, planning an alibi, or thinking through his options. Or he may be willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> topics but not others ... Simply presuming an invocation after some initial period of silence ... would override the wishes of those suspects who wanted to listen and deliberate further, rather than to end questioning. ... Once a suspect has been provided with the requisite warnings and has had an opportunity to invoke his rights, the primary purposes of Miranda are fulfilled. This Court has described [...] "a person's right to cut off questioning" [...] as [...] "he critical safeguard" [...] provided by the Miranda warnings." ...|$|E
60|$|They walked {{farther and}} looked at a dozen other things. Newman pointed out what pleased him, and Mademoiselle Noemie {{generally}} criticised it, and proposed something else. Then suddenly she diverged and began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> personal matter.|$|E

60|$|She {{then went}} on <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> Walford people, {{and asked me if}} I knew Mary Talbot. I replied in the affirmative, for Miss Talbot was a member of our {{literary}} society, and the young lady informed me that Mary Talbot had a brother in my school--a fact of which I was aware to my sorrow--and it was on account of this brother that she had first happened to see me.|$|E
60|$|Marston stopped abruptly. He {{wanted to}} go down and turn out the fellow, but doubted if he would be justified, {{although}} he was Wyndham's partner. Somehow it was unthinkable the brute and his comrade should engage in quiet talk. For all that, he did not go, and turning back a few yards stopped again. He must not be a fool, and no doubt the fellow had come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> goods his friends in the bush could supply. Marston did not want the goods, but forced himself to wait.|$|E

I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies, that he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on his guard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected." ...|$|E

I've believed that always--in spite of a thousand little things I believe it now. I go back on nothing. I'm not fighting as an American either. I'm fighting simply as myself.... I'm not going fighting for England, mind you. Don't you fancy that. I don't know I'm so particularly in love with a lot of English ways as to do that. I don't see how any one can be very much in love with your Empire, with its dead-alive Court, its artful politicians, its lords and ladies and snobs, its way with the Irish and its way with India, and everybody shifting responsibility and telling lies about your common people. I'm not going fighting for England. I'm going fighting for Cissie--and justice and Belgium and all that--but more particularly for Cissie. And anyhow I can't look Pa Britling in the face any more.... And I want to see those trenches--close. I reckon they're a thing it will be interesting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> day.... So I'm going," [...] said Mr. Direck.

[...] And {{raising her}} eyes for one more of those half-bewildered looks, she moved away along the Embankment wall. When {{she was out of}} sight, Noel walked back to the station. The train was in, and she took her seat. She had three fellow passengers, all in khaki; very silent and moody, as men are when they have to get up early. One was tall, dark, and perhaps thirty-five; the second small, and about fifty, with cropped, scanty grey hair; the third was of medium height and quite sixty-five, with a long row of little {{coloured}} patches on his tunic, and a bald, narrow, well-shaped head, grey hair brushed back at the sides, and the thin, collected features and drooping moustache of the old school. It was at him that Noel looked. When he glanced out of the window, or otherwise retired within himself, she liked his face; but when he turned to the ticket-collector or spoke to the others, she did not like it half so much. It was as if the old fellow had two selves, one of which he used when alone, the other in which he dressed every morning to meet the world. They had begun <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> Tribunal on which they had to sit. Noel did not listen, but a word or two carried to her now and then.|$|E
60|$|Now these heathens, to {{whom the}} apostles preached, before they heard the gospel, knew that word grace very well indeed, often used it; and saw it written up in their heathen temples all about them. And they meant by it just what we mean, when we talk of a graceful person, or a graceful tree or flower; and what we mean, too, when we say that any one is gracious; that they do things gracefully, {{and have a great}} deal of grace in their way of {{speaking}} and behaving. We mean by that that they are handsome, agreeable, amiable, pleasant to look at, and talk to, and deal with. And so these heathens meant, before they were Christians. The Romans used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> one called a Grace. The Greeks called her CHARIS; which is exactly the word which St John and St Paul use, and from it come our words charity and charitable. But more; they used to talk of three Graces: they fancied that they were goddesses--spirits of some kind in the shape of beautiful, and amiable, and innocent maidens, who took delight in going about the world and making people happy and amiable like themselves; and they used to make images of these graces, and pray to them to make them lovely, and happy, and agreeable. And painters and statuaries, too, used to pray to these graces, and ask them to put beautiful fancies into their minds, that they might be able to paint beautiful pictures, and carve beautiful statues. So when St Paul or St John talked to these heathens about grace, or Charis (as the Testament calls it), they knew quite well what the apostles meant.|$|E

Don Simpson and I were still married then, and one of our entertainments was reading aloud to each other.

I never typed out a copy of it, but I am afraid I did start the ball rolling.|$|R
