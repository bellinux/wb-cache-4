25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies {{at the root of}} feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

According to him, magic and science clearly exist {{within the confines of}} Ooo, but more importantly, they also represent two completely different ways of viewing the world. Science is a way of [...] "observ the world, mak educated guesses about how it works and conduct expierments [...] in order to confirm or disprove our ideas about the world. [...] Science requires that we be rational, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> actively understand the world, and to take steps to verify our understanding." [...] In this sense, it is the ultimately responsible perspective. Magic, on the other hand, is [...] "the metaphysics of immaturity" [...] because it does not require understanding the reality of the actual world. Magic, according to Karavitis, is therefore an irresponsible perspective to take.|$|E

The Andersons had originally intended to film the script as a one-hour drama for ATV; Sylvia explained that since the concept [...] "was too good for a television play, I suggested to Gerry <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> develop it as a movie." [...] Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had [...] "dark" [...] scripting, Gerry stated that he wanted the film to have an interesting and entertaining premise. He also discussed {{the significance of the}} title, which was suggested to him by Century 21 co-director John Read: Doppelgänger being [...] "a German word which means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word." ...|$|E

It is a question chiefly of the activity of the horses, as of the skill of their riders, and our little moor horses are as active as young goats; and although neither horse nor rider can stand a charge of a heavily-armed knight or squire, methinks that if one of our troopers brought him to a stand, he would get the better of him, save if the knight took to mace or battle-axe." ...|$|E

6000|$|To {{compete with}} this {{lure of the}} towns, there must first be {{national}} consciousness of its danger; then coherent national effort to fight it. We must destroy the shibboleth: [...] "All for wealth!" [...] and re-write it: [...] "All for health!"--the only wealth worth having. Wealth is not an end, surely. Then, to what is it the means, if not to health? Once we admit {{that in spite of}} our wealth our national health is going downhill through town-blight, we assert the failure of our country's ideals and life. And if, having got into a vicious state of congested town existence, we refuse to make an effort to get out again, because it is necessary to [...] "hold our own commercially," [...] and feed [...] "the people" [...] cheaply, we are in effect saying: [...] "We certainly are going to hell, but look--how successfully!"

Yielding to no one in desire that [...] "the people" [...] should be well, nay better, fed, I decline utterly to accept the doctrine {{that there is no way}} of doing this compatible with an increased country population and the growth of our own food. In national matters, where there is a general and not a mere Party will, there is a way, and the way is not to be recoiled from because the first years of the change may necessitate Governmental regulation. Many people hold that our salvation will come through education. Education on right lines underlies everything, of course; but unless education includes the growth of our own food and return to the land in substantial measure, education cannot save us.|$|E

60|$|DEAR COLVIN,--Saturday {{there was}} a ball to the ship, and on Sunday Gurr had a child to be baptized. Belle was to be godmother {{and had to be}} got down; which was impossible, as the jester Euclid says. However, we had four men of very {{different}} heights take the poles of a sort of bier and carry her shoulder high down the road, till we met a trap. On the return journey on Sunday, they were led by Austin playing (?) on a bugle, and {{you have no idea how}} picturesque a business it was; the four half-naked bearers, the cane lounge at that height from the ground, and Belle in black and pretty pale reclining very like a dead warrior of yore. However she wasn't dead yet. All the rest of the afternoon we hung about and had consultations about the baptism. Just as we went in to dinner, I saw the moon rise accurately full, looking five times greater than nature, and the face <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> decipher in its silver disk wearing an obliterated but benignant expression. The ball followed; bluejackets and officers danced indiscriminately, after their pleasant fashion; and Belle, who lay in the hotel verandah, and held a sort of reception all night, had her longest visit from one of the blue-jackets, her partner in the last ball. About one on the Sunday morning all was over, and we went to bed--I, alas! only to get up again, my room being in the verandah, where a certain solemnly absurd family conclave (all drunk) was being held until (I suppose) three. By six, I was awake, and went out on the verandah. On the east the dawn had broken, cold and pink and rust colour, and the marshes were all smoking whitely and blowing into the bay like smoke, but on the west, all was golden. The street was empty, and right over it hung the setting moon, accurately round, yellow as an apricot, but slumberous, with an effect of afternoon you would not believe if you had not seen it. Then followed a couple of hours on the verandah I would be glad to forget. By seven X. Y. had joined me, as drunk as they make 'em. As he sat and talked to me, he smelt of the charnel house, methought. He looked so old (he is one month my senior); he spoke so silly; his poor leg is again covered with boils, which will spell death to him; and--enough. That interview has made me a teetotaller. O, it is bad to grow old. For me, it is practically hell. I do not like the consolations of age. I was born a young man; I have continued so; and before I end, a pantaloon, a driveller--enough again. But I don't enjoy getting elderly. Belle and I got home about three in the afternoon, she having in the meantime renounced all that makes life worth living in the name of little Miss Gurr, and I seriously reflecting on renouncing the kindly bowl in earnest! Presently after arrived the news of Margery Ide (the C.J.'s daughter) being seriously ill, alarmingly ill. Fanny wanted to go down; it was a difficult choice; she was not fit for it; on the other hand (and by all accounts) the patient would die if she did not get better nursing. So we made up our own minds, and F. and I set out about dusk, came to the C.J.'s in the middle of dinner, and announced our errand. I am glad to say the C.J. received her very willingly; and I came home again, leaving her behind, where she was certainly much wanted.|$|E
