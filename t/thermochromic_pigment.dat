40|$|PURPOSE. Maxillofacial {{silicone}} elastomer is usually colored intrinsically with color pigments to match skin colors. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the color stability of a maxillofacial {{silicone elastomer}}, colored with a thermochromic, color changing pigment. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Disc-shaped maxillofacial silicone specimens were prepared and divided into 3 groups: a conventionally colored control group, one group additionally colored with 0. 2 wt % <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigment,</b> and one group with 0. 6 wt% <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigment.</b> Half of the surface of each specimen was covered with an aluminium foil. All of the specimens were exposed to UV radiation in 6 hour cycles over 46 days. In between the UV exposures, half of the specimens were stored in darkness, at room temperature, and the other half was stored in an incubator, at a humidity of 97 % and a temperature of + 37 ℃. Color measurements were made with a spectrophotometer and registered according to the CIELAB L*a*b * color model system. The changes in L*, a * and b * values during artificial aging were statistically analyzed by using paired samples t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. P-values <. 05 were considered as statistically significant. RESULTS. The UV exposure resulted in visually noticeable and statistically significant color changes in the L*, a * and b * values in both of the test groups containing <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigment.</b> Storage in the incubator lead to statistically significant color changes in the a * and b * values of the specimens containing <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigment,</b> compared to those stored at roo...|$|E

40|$|Is it {{possible}} to change the environment light without changing or act in the light source? Smart textiles materials and new technologies open the possibility to introduce dynamic behaviours to elements that use to be static. Using the ability of Colour Change Materials to answer to external stimulus, this paper studies how colour variation of textile samples, treated with reversible <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments,</b> filter the artificial light intensity that go by (pass) through it. In this work a set of screen printing samples have been developed in which have been applied <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> or a mixture of <b>thermochromic</b> and common <b>pigments.</b> Differences in light transmission are measured and correlated with the different processes employed, an overlapping of layers of different pigments or only one layer {{with a mixture of}} both types of pigments, in such way to get similar colour when activated. The results indicate that a sample activated by heat may achieve different light intensity transmitted, in terms of luminosity (dark colours absorb more than light colours) and according with the requirement of the pigments to absorb light to get colour...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} flexible reflective thermochromic display (TCD) comprised of <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> and a patterned {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) film coated on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate, and the display’s thermo-optical characteristics. The display showed maximum red, green, and blue reflectances of 30 %, 38 %, and 29 %, respectively. Furthermore, the display exhibited a continuous grey color when the temperature was changed continuously. As a flexible display, the display showed reliable thermo-optical performance without image damage even when highly bent.

40|$|Methods were {{developed}} for application of <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> to textiles, based on printing and extrusion, for both leuco dye based and cholesteric liquid crystal thermochromics. The leuco dye based thermochromics were assessed {{in terms of}} heat stability, binder optimization and colour saturation using an instrumental colour measurement system. Enhancement of lightfastness of leuco dye based thermochromics was carried out using UV absorbers, HALS and antioxidants as additives. A comparative study was also carried out between printing and extrusion application methods. A colour measurement system with the facility for temperature variation was constructed using two traditional components – a reflectance spectrophotometer and a controllable hot stage. The dynamic colour change of leuco dye based thermochromics with temperature was assessed. The liquid crystals were assessed with temperature for their additive colour mixing properties by layering them over each other. They were also assessed in terms of aspects of applications, such as differences in the over-layering sequence and colour hysteresis on heating and cooling. The results were evaluated not only to provide a scientific understanding of the performance but also to provide useful information from a creative designer’s point of view. The research carried out as described in this thesis has established an improved understanding of the application methods for leuco dye based and liquid crystal <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> for optimum performance. The availability and selection of colours achievable with liquid crystal thermochromics have been widened significantly by the improved understanding of the colours derived from over-layered liquid crystals. It is anticipated that this research will broaden the potential for use of leuco dye based and liquid crystal thermochromics in textiles, especially {{in the fields of}} functional textiles and creative design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{property}} of some materials {{to change their}} color in response to temperature changes is called thermochromism. A polymer fiber manufactured in such way that a <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigment</b> {{is embedded in the}} polymeric matrix material develops accordingly thermochromic functionality and {{can be used as a}} temperature change indicator. The characterization of a polymer thermochromic fiber with respect to its color change in response to temperature change is presented in this paper. A specially developed characterization apparatus was developed for this purpose. The temperature span of the involved experiment was from 23. 5 °C (room temperature) to 60 °C, while the tested fiber was found to be responsive regarding its chromatic variance mainly within the temperature range 30. 5 oC- 50 oC. During the involved digital image processing, the chromatic shift of the sample was characterized according to the HSV (hue-saturation-value) color model. Fiber’s original color was found to change with temperature by presenting a monotonic reduction of saturation and value with temperature increase...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} {{compounds}} of Co(1 -x) Mg(x) MoO(4) compositions has been prepared by a conventional ceramic route. The {{members of the}} whole solid solution exhibit a reversible first-order phase transition which was probed by using thermal expansion and low-temperature reflectivity techniques. Whereas the α → β transition temperature evolves linearly on warming from 435 to 200 °C with x going from 0 to 0. 9, the β → α transition temperature variation falls down on cooling from - 40 °C to - 140 °C going from CoMoO(4) to Co(0. 1) Mg(0. 9) MoO(4) with an asymptotic evolution. The phase transition temperatures have been explained {{on the basis of}} a crystal polarization effect under substitution of Mg for Co. Thus, from an applicative point of view, new <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> with tunable transition temperatures are here proposed...|$|R
40|$|Drying {{is one of}} the {{standard}} unit operations in the pharmaceutical industry and it is important to become aware of the circumstances that dominate during the process. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test microcapsulated <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> as heat indicators in a fluid bed drying process. The indicator powders were manually granulated with α-lactose monohydrate resulting in three particle-size groups. Also, pellets were coated with the indicator powders. The granules and pellets were fluidized in fluid bed dryer to observe the progress of the heat flow in the material and to study the heat indicator properties of the indicator materials. A tristimulus colorimeter was used to measure CIELAB color values. Color indicator for heat detection can be utilized to test if the heat-sensitive API would go through physical changes during the pharmaceutical drying process. Both the prepared granules and pellets can be used as heat indicator in fluid bed drying process. The colored heat indicators give an opportunity to learn new aspects of the process at real time and could be exploded, for example, for scaling-up studies...|$|R
40|$|Thermochromic {{colorants}} {{have been}} developed since before the 1900 s. There are {{a large number of}} patents in different applications of thermochromic textiles, but many innovations leave the field of aesthetic and functional textile design unexplored in the area of smart materials. This study aims to develop thermochromic home textiles that change colors and patterns by integrating <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> and electric conductive yarns into textile structures. Stainless steel conductive yarns were sewed on textile substrates to enable heat generation to increase fabric temperature. The heat generation and temperature rise could be controlled by monitoring the voltage applied. The experiments of this study focused on analyzing electric resistance and heating properties of the conductive yarns and observing color changing time and color changing effects of the thermochromic textiles. By using the technique in this research, an image of “tai chi” was designed and implemented in a backlighting thermochromic fabric. It illustrates a range of opportunities for thermochromic textiles in new design research directions of Chinese calligraphy and traditional Chinese painting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} new smart {{pigments}} {{with a strong}} colour change in a given temperature (T) range {{turns out to be}} often very time-consuming and costly. Based on this observation, we propose here a cheap solution consisting in the mixing in appropriate amounts of a semiconductor and a d-d transition based pigment. The former exhibits a strong temperature dependence of its optical gap while the second presents a null or moderate evolution of the positioning of its absorption band with T. This results in the generation of various reversible thermochromic effects with control of both the temperaturetransition and the hue in the low and high temperature stages. An example will be devoted to the reproduction of the Al 2 −xCrxO 3 corundum behaviour in the 20 - 200 °C domain with a Bi 2 O 3 -LiCoPO 4 blend. The proposed recipe, easily extrapolated {{to a wide range of}} colour changes, is only based on the well known subtractive colouring model, and the evolution of the chromatic coefficients of each ingredient with T. This opens up the door to the development of a new generation of <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments</b> with unsaturated colours for potential applications as temperature indicators...|$|R
40|$|Electronic textiles, also {{referred}} to as smart fabrics, are quite fashionable right now. Their close relationship with the field of computer wearables gives us many diverging research directions and possible definitions. On one end of the spectrum, there are pragmatic applications such as military research into interactive camouflage or textiles that can heal wounded soldiers. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, work is being done by artists and designers in the area of reactive clothes: “second skins ” that can adapt to the environment and to the individual. Fashion, health, and telecommunication industries are also pursuing the vision of clothing that can express aspects of people’s personalities, needs, and desires or augment social dynamics through the use and display of aggregate social information. In my current production-based research, I develop enabling technology for electronic textiles based upon my theoretical evaluation of the historical and cultural modalities of textiles as they relate to future computational forms. My work involves the use of conductive yarns and fibers for power delivery, communication, and networking, as well as new materials for display that use electronic ink, nitinol, and <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments.</b> The textiles are created using traditional textile manufacturing techniques: spinning conductive yarns, weaving, knitting, embroidering, sewing, and printing with inks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThermochromic {{pigments}} {{are commonly}} used for off-line temperature mapping on components from systems operating at a temperature higher than 1073 K. However, their temperature resolution is often limited by the discrete number of color transitions they offer. This paper investigates the potential of erbia-yttria co-doped zirconia as a florescent thermal history sensor alternative to <b>thermochromic</b> <b>pigments.</b> Samples of yttria-stabilized zirconia powder (YSZ, 8. 3 mol% YO 1. 5) doped with 1. 5 mol% ErO 1. 5 and synthesized by a sol-gel route are calcined for 15 minutes under isothermal conditions between 1173 and 1423 K. The effects of temperature on their crystal structure and room temperature fluorescence properties are then studied. Results show a steady increase of the crystallinity of the powders with temperature, causing a significant and permanent increase of the emission intensity and fluorescence lifetime {{which could be used}} to determine temperature with a calculated theoretical resolution lower than 1 K for intensity. The intensity ratio obtained using a temperature insensitive YSZ: Eu 3 + reference phosphor is proposed as a more robust parameter regarding experimental conditions for determining thermal history. Finally, the possibilities for integrating this fluorescent marker into sol-gel deposited coatings for future practical thermal history sensing applications is also discussed...|$|R

Focused on colour change and shape memory materials integration in textile substrates, Narratives of winter daylight researches technical and expressional possibilities of smart textiles structures to transform incident light that passes through them – light transmittance – without acting upon the light source. This research prototype is inspired by the dynamic quality of natural daylight.

Results set a framework to assist design decisions on colours, morphology and interaction. Perception of textiles behaviour and light transmittance variation, aroused by diverse activation sequences, present visual narratives of dynamic light scenarios.

40|$|Innovation in the {{emerging}} field of smart textiles is providing challenging materials and technologies, which require new knowledge and skills in the design practice. This scenario also represents new possibilities to interact with people and environment. To achieve different ambient light, several lamps or dimmers that regulate the light intensity are normally applied. Focusing on light, {{the aim of this}} study is to develop textile structure, printed with <b>thermochromic</b> and conventional <b>pigments,</b> with dynamic behaviour that changes ambient light without acting upon the light source. The developed design process addresses a set of results and conclusions of previous research on how to combine and print with the above-mentioned materials in order to achieve differences in light transmittance when the thermochromic textiles are activated. The product development explores textile expressions and structural possibilities through origami techniques, strengthening and highlighting the effect between morphology and light projections. As a result, designed thermochromic textile structure affect light in colour and intensity outcomes, creating dynamic ambient light.
