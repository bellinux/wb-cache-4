[...] Schell also advises those interested in activism to [...] "know your audience" [...] and understand your resources, people, money, and supplies.

2500|$|After {{the award}} had been given, the L.A. Timess Bob Sipchen, who opposed Iversen, {{then went on}} to extract quotes from {{precisely}} the five students his paper had awarded, even though none of those students had ever met Iversen, getting one ex-Wolfpacket staffer to say that Iversen was [...] "exaggerating everything that happened and blatantly lying about his experience." [...] The only student Sipchen interviewed who actually knew Iversen said that the book was “dead on.” [...] Sipchen came under attack for his journalistic integrity with this technique, leading pundit Dr. Blogstein to write, “Butter up your sources with prizes and then get quotes <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>your</b> opinion. How is that legal?” Shortly thereafter, Sipchen was bought out by Times management to quit and departed to work at the Sierra Club newsletter, of which exit 39-year Times veteran Ken Reich wrote, “Not such a loss is Bob Sipchen, whose ill-informed educational column was the latest in a whole series of assignments he had filled unsuccessfully.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. [...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>your</b> family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E
