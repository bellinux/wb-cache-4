5|$|In 1956 Kim started Kim Ki-young Productions, {{and began}} making melodramas, {{the most popular}} film genre in South Korea at the time. His first {{independent}} production was <b>Touch-Me-Not</b> (1956). In 1957, Kim was living near the red-light district of Yongsan, and the atmosphere of this neighborhood influenced his films, A Woman's War and Twilight Train (both 1957). With First Snow (1958), Kim moved from melodrama to a more socially conscious realism. Defiance of a Teenager (1959) and Sad Pastorale (1960) followed in this style. Defiance of a Teenager was one of Kim's most successful and respected early works, and he attended the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1960 for a showing of this film.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of <b>touch-me-not</b> balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E

6000|$|In 1830 {{it was a}} snug {{collection}} of modest one- and two-story frame dwellings, whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines, honeysuckles, and morning glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, <b>touch-me-nots,</b> prince's-feathers, and other old-fashioned flowers; while on the windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted, and properly revered cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title? ...|$|R

60|$|The {{next morning}} a mysterious change {{seemed to have}} passed over {{the members of the}} family during the night. It was Sunday. Honora, when she left her room, heard a swishing on the stairs--Mrs. Joshua, stiffly arrayed for the day. Even Mrs. Robert swished, but Mrs. Holt, in a bronze-coloured silk, swished most of all as she entered the library after a brief errand to the housekeeper's room. Mr. Holt was already {{arranging}} his book-marks in the Bible, while Joshua and Robert, in black cutaways that seemed to have the benumbing and paralyzing effect of strait-jackets, wandered aimlessly about the room, as though its walls were the limit of their movements. The children had a subdued and <b>touch-me-not</b> air that reminded Honora of her own youth.|$|E
60|$|From {{the loss}} of a tooth to that of a {{mistress}} there's no pang that is not bearable. The apprehension is much more cruel than the certainty; and we make up our mind to the misfortune when 'tis irremediable, part with the tormentor, and mumble our crust on t'other side of the jaws. I think Colonel Esmond was relieved when a ducal coach and six came and whisked his charmer away out of his reach, and placed her in a higher sphere. As you have seen the nymph in the opera-machine go up to the clouds {{at the end of the}} piece where Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, and all the divine company of Olympians are seated, and quaver out her last song as a goddess: so when this portentous elevation was accomplished in the Esmond family, I am not sure that every one of us did not treat the divine Beatrix with special honors; at least the saucy little beauty carried her head with a toss of supreme authority, and assumed a <b>touch-me-not</b> air, which all her friends very good-humoredly bowed to.|$|E

50|$|Diet {{varies with}} {{geographic}} location and season. One hundred three mice taken in central New York had stomach contents containing the fungi {{of the genus}} Endogone and related genera.

Fungi represent {{about a third of}} the New York diet, seeds 25%, lepidoptrous larvae and various fruits about 10%, and beetles about 7.5%. <b>Touch-me-not</b> seeds are found in the diet. Food is not consumed during hibernation and mice having insufficient fat reserves do not survive.|$|E
50|$|Mimulus michiganensis {{is found}} almost {{exclusively}} {{on the shores of}} the Great Lakes, or what were ancient shorelines. It grows on lakesides and stream banks in wet, saturated soils or in very shallow water. It requires cold, clear flowing water in full sunlight. The substrate is sand covered in muck. It also appears to require a narrow pH range that is slightly alkaline. The habitat is the edges of forests dominated by northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Other plants in the area may include <b>touch-me-not</b> (Impatiens biflora), water forget-me-not (Myosotis scorpioides), watercress (Nasturtium officinale), wild mint (Mentha arvensis), and marsh marigold (Caltha palustris).|$|E
50|$|Since the 1990s, Yun {{has written}} novels that reflect a broader {{view of history}} and reality.

Recently, she adapted her 1982 novel Emi ireumeun josenppiyeotda (에미 이름은 조센삐였다 Your Ma's Name Was Chosun Whore) into a play entitled Bongseonhwa (봉선화 <b>Touch-me-not).</b> These two works raise the issue of Korean “comfort women” forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II.|$|E

50|$|Rights-of-way include areas along roads, railroads, or bike trails. Various {{types of}} {{habitats}} may be disturbed by a right-of-way. Disturbed wet woodland {{tend to have}} a quaking aspen canopy and blackberry as the shrub layer. Blue joint grass and <b>touch-me-not.</b> (Impatiens) are the dominant herbaceous plants. There is seldom a canopy layer on Rights-of-ways. The shrub layer ranges from sparse to thick but is sparse in most right-of-ways. Blackberries are a dominant shrub with rose, grapes, Japanese honeysuckle, Spiraea, and shining sumac dominant in some areas. Many herbaceous plants are present. Some dominant species are blue joint grass, other grasses, and rushes. Other plants like marsh fern can be present.|$|E
5000|$|Mimosa pudica (from pudica [...] "shy, bashful or shrinking"; {{also called}} {{sensitive}} plant, sleepy plant, Dormilones, <b>touch-me-not,</b> or shy plant) is a creeping annual or perennial herb of the pea family Fabaceae often grown for its curiosity value: the compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, defending themselves from harm, and re-open {{a few minutes}} later. The species is native to South America and Central America, but is now a pantropical weed. It {{can also be found}} in Asia in countries such as Bangladesh, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos , Japan and Sri Lanka [...] It grows mostly in undisturbed shady areas, under trees or shrubs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{inclusion}} of two kasa written in hangul {{in the collection}} is one of scholarly contention, as her authorship is in doubt. Composition in hangul was considered unworthy of expressing higher thinking of Confucian ideals, and [...] "literary" [...] composition in Korea was almost entirely composed in hanmun. The distinction {{at the time was}} similar to the differences between Latin composition and vernacular prose in Renaissance Europe. Her authorship of these two pieces is supported mainly by the observation that the titles of the two kasa pieces, [...] "Song of Woman's Complaint" [...] and [...] "Song of Coloring Nails with <b>Touch-me-not</b> Balsam" [...] are very similar to two verified hanmun (cheolgu and koshi respectively). These claims have in part discredited by recent scholarship by O Haein (Nansorhon shijip) and Kang Cheongseop (Moktongga ui pogwon e taehayo).|$|E
