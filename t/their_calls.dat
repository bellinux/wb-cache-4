5|$|American crows are the {{new world}} {{counterpart}} to the carrion crow and the hooded crow. Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, <b>their</b> <b>calls</b> are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural group on the basis of similarities in <b>their</b> <b>calls.</b> This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when <b>their</b> <b>calls,</b> though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E
50|$|Supportworks is {{packaged}} with {{a web-based}} self-service portal, allowing customers to create {{calls in the}} system using a web browser, without requiring assistance from an analyst. When a customer creates a call through the self-service portal an email is generated with a reference number for the customer. The reference number allows them to track the progress of <b>their</b> <b>call</b> through the portal. Through this interface {{they are able to}} escalate <b>their</b> <b>call,</b> update <b>their</b> <b>call,</b> attach files to <b>their</b> <b>call,</b> and see which analyst is working on <b>their</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} <b>their</b> <b>calls</b> and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by <b>their</b> <b>calls,</b> though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|The various dissidents {{formed a}} pro-Thi, anti-Kỳ {{organization}} called the Military-Civilian Struggle Committee, {{better known as the}} Struggle Movement. Their message and influence quickly spread as they called for the end of military rule and took over radio stations and government buildings in I Corps. They intensified <b>their</b> <b>calls</b> for Kỳ to fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections. Some I Corps units supportive of Thi then decided to join the Struggle Movement and ceased military operations against the Vietcong, instead starting a stand-off against Kỳ. Throughout April and May there were tense incidents as units loyal to the junta were flown in from Saigon, and the factions came close to warfare.|$|E

5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating <b>their</b> <b>calls</b> or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran {{notice that}} {{something}} is wrong between them. Imran later reassures his friends that everything is okay. The trio visit Seville for sky diving, Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part. However, they complete it without any obstacles. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight. After Laila and Nuria do not answer <b>their</b> <b>calls</b> to bail them out, Imran reluntantly proceeds to call Salman Habib. Salman bails them out and takes them to his home. While speaking to Imran, Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of a married life with kids, while Imran's mother did, which is why he never contacted Imran. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years back. He earnestly apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs and}} calls of antbirds are {{generally}} composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family {{is one of}} the suboscines (suborder Tyranni) which have simpler syrinxes ("voiceboxes") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear. Antbirds rely on <b>their</b> <b>calls</b> for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the loudsong and the softsong. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a territorial purpose and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment. In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart. Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds. The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in mobbing of predators. The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.|$|E
