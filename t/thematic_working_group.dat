40|$|The {{synthesis}} report {{is part of}} a series of papers on Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD) in Africa’s <b>thematic</b> <b>working</b> <b>group</b> on Matching national realities with global commitments. The <b>thematic</b> <b>working</b> <b>group</b> addressed the main question on how African governments implement their global commitments while fostering a viable pluralistic sector. The main hypothesis was that making these commitments more coherent with the practices and realities of farmers and creating an enabling environment for strengthening multiple seed systems will increase farmers’ access to quality seed. Three main topics were discussed under this theme: access and benefit sharing for climate resilient seed systems; national and regional seed laws that support the development of a robust, integrated seed sector that supports smallholder farmers' needs; and creating room for informal and intermediary seed systems in a UPOV ' 91 informed Plant Variety Protection system. This study provides an overview of climate related changes in past, present and future and the challenges to access to and exchange of genetic resources for climate change adaptation through different access and benefit sharing regimes in 4 countries – Zambia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda. Findings from the studies indicate that most African countries face challenges in accessing required PGR for climate change adaptation because they do not have online accession-level documentation; they have not fully implemented international commitments related to ABS and national and regional seed laws hamper the flow of seeds and genetic resources. As a way forward the paper proposes capacity development for mutually supportive implementation of the ITPGRFA, Nagoya protocol and seed laws in ways which reflect the reality and diversity of different seed systems...|$|E

The study was conducted to answer a key question on how the various national and regional seed laws relate to the diversity of seed systems that exist in a given country. More specifically how current seed laws affect informal (farmer-based) seed systems and in what manner seed laws can be adapted to support these seed systems. Policies, laws and regulations of 32 African countries were carefully reviewed to identify some best practices and key issues and challenges in regulation. Findings from the study indicate that the main challenge for many African countries is that their seed regulations don’t include provisions that support farmer -led seed systems. As a way forward, there is need for revision of existing regulatory frameworks to takes into account the needs and characteristics of the various seed systems in order to increase the availability of quality seed of preferred varieties for all farmers...|$|E
