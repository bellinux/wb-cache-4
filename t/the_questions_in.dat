Users were also able to read Jack's blogs and upload their own business advice in video form. Users were able to submit sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan and act out skits from TGS. The feature reopened Ask Tina, an interactive question and answer platform in which users could ask Fey questions. Fey answered <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> video form. Ask Tina was a fixture on NBC.com's 30 Rock section throughout the first season.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} that started in 1986, a complete overhaul of how the CPS was administered and what type of questions were asked occurred. Prior to 1994, the alternate measures of unemployment had different names because the BLS drastically revised <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> the CPS and renamed the measures: U3 and U4 were eliminated; the official rate U5 remained the same measure but was renamed U3; U6 and U7 were revised and renamed U5 and U6.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, the Lancashire Telegraph {{reported}} that Burnley topped Home Office {{figures for the}} highest number of burglaries per head in England and Wales between April 2008– April 2009.

However, in May 2010 the NPIA Local Crime Mapping System (believed to be the source of the data in the report) listed a 49.5% drop in this rate on the previous year.|$|E

25|$|Hodge's {{literary}} {{powers were}} seen {{at their best}} in his contributions to the Princeton Theological Review, {{many of which are}} acknowledged masterpieces of controversial writing. They cover a wide range of topics, from apologetic questions that concern common Christianity to questions of ecclesiastical administration, in which only Presbyterians have been supposed to take interest. But <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> debate among American theologians during the period covered by Hodge's life belonged, for the most part, to the departments of anthropology and soteriology; and it was upon these, accordingly, that his polemic powers were mainly applied.|$|E
25|$|Raiden {{appears in}} the Mortal Kombat comic books in his usual role as the guide and mentor of the Earthrealm warriors.

However, in {{a departure from the}} storyline of the first game, he was not allowed to participate in the tournament in the miniseries Blood & Thunder, due to his godly status.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E

25|$|Through {{his wife}} Eleanor, {{he had come}} to know much about Ireland and {{especially}} Northern Ireland. She came from the Protestant plantation community of Ulster, originating largely in south-western Scotland. Presumably because of this knowledge, Davis was in 1985 induced by Sir David Wills into a project in historical education, to be financed by the Wills Trust, to encourage better understanding between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and presumably between Catholics and Protestants in the North. Davis recruited teachers, school inspectors and academics to serve on a committee to frame a curriculum of Irish history which would be acceptable to schools in both North and South. The committee oversaw the writing of <b>the</b> <b>Questions</b> <b>in</b> Irish History series of history books. The Teaching of History Trust has continued to work long afterwards, sponsored by Longman. The first volumes of the series are dedicated to Ralph Davis' memory. He was still actively working for peace in Northern Ireland when he died.|$|E
25|$|To {{design the}} {{memorial}} on the slightly restricted site, the memorial foundation held a design competition. On November 11, 2002, the DVLMF invited about 20 architects and landscape architects to submit design proposals for the memorial. Six firms {{responded with a}} proposal. The DVLMF established a nine-member design committee consisting {{of members of the}} foundation's Board of Directors as well as noted architects, artists, and landscape architects. In February 2003, the six proposals were presented anonymously to the design committee. Two firms, Michael Vergason Landscape Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, were asked to submit a refined proposal. This second proposal included, among other things, cost estimates, a project schedule, and a scale model. The design committee submitted a list of questions to each firm, and asked them to address <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> their second submission. Each firm was also asked to discuss possible design alternatives. In July 2003, the design committee selected Michael Vergason Landscape Architects as the memorial designer. The DVLMF Board of Directors affirmed the choice.|$|E
25|$|Japanese espionage against Pearl Harbor {{involved}} {{at least two}} Abwehr agents. One of them, Otto Kuhn, was a sleeper agent living in Hawaii with his family. Kuhn was incompetent {{and there is no}} evidence he provided information of value. The other, Yugoslavian businessman Dusko Popov, was a double agent, working for the XX Committee of MI5. In August 1941, he was sent by the Abwehr to the U.S., with an assignment list that included specific questions about military facilities in Oahu, including Pearl Harbor. Although British Security Coordination introduced Popov to the FBI, the Americans seem to have paid little attention. It is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence from the British contributed to J. Edgar Hoover's dismissing Popov's interest in Pearl Harbor as unimportant. There is nothing to show his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence, nor was he allowed to visit Hawaii. Popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack, ignored by the bungling FBI. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> his list were rambling and general, and in no way pointed to air attack on Pearl Harbor. Prange considered Popov's claim overblown, and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of Abwehr thoroughness.|$|E

500|$|The Rutherford {{government}} {{had just been}} resoundingly re-elected in the 1909 provincial election, winning 36 of the legislature's 41 seats, when the new legislature first met in February 1910. [...] There was initially no sign of controversy {{in relation to the}} A Railway: William Clarke, A President, had several months earlier announced that the line would be completed by the end of 1912, ahead of schedule. [...] When the A bonds went on sale in London in November 1909, the issue was oversubscribed. [...] The following month, the contract for ties was awarded. [...] Everything seemed to be progressing as planned when, {{at the beginning of the}} new legislative session, Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle asked the government a series of innocuous questions about the company and the guarantees made to it. [...] Rutherford, Minister of Railways as well as Premier, responded to <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> writing. [...] Before he did so, however, a rumour began to circulate that William Henry Cushing, Minister of Public Works, had resigned from the cabinet.|$|E
500|$|The Progressive was {{a left-wing}} American monthly {{magazine}} of politics, culture and opinion with {{a circulation of}} around 40,000. In 1978, its managing editor, Sam Day, Jr., a {{former editor of the}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and its editor, Erwin Knoll, commissioned freelance journalist Howard Morland to write an article on the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons production in America. In October 1978, Morland got Representative Ronald V. Dellums to submit a series of questions about plutonium production to the Department of Energy (DOE), the successor to the AEC. The DOE responded by classifying <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>In</b> September and October 1978, the House Armed Services Committee held hearings on the proposed Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. There was widespread public ignorance of issues surrounding nuclear weapons, and associated environmental concerns. Day and Morland hoped that by demystifying nuclear weapons, they would promote more critical public debate, and improve the prospects for nuclear disarmament. Morland claimed that [...] "I am precisely the type of person the First Amendment was intended to protect: a political advocate whose ideas are unpopular with the general public and threatening to the government." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a lively}} {{exchange}} over {{what has come}} to be referred to as [...] "the Chinese room argument", John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls [...] "strong artificial intelligence (AI)" [...] that a computer program can be conscious, though he does agree with advocates of [...] "weak AI" [...] that computer programs can be formatted to [...] "simulate" [...] conscious states. [...] His own view is that consciousness has subjective, first-person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically; conscious persons can perform computations, but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are. [...] To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese, Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker (Searle himself, in fact), a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input, and boxes filled with Chinese symbols. [...] In this case, the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program. [...] Searle argues that with such a machine, he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese, nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean. [...] If the experiment were done in English, since Searle knows English, he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions, and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve. [...] Searle would pass the Turing test of answering <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> both languages, but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English. [...] Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language, but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped.|$|E
