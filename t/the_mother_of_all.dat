5|$|According to the Ramayana, Surabhi is the {{daughter}} of sage Kashyapa and his wife Krodhavasha, {{the daughter}} of Daksha. Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described as <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> cows in the text. However, in the Puranas, such as Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, Surabhi is described as the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, as well as the mother of cows and buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, {{where she}} {{is also known as}} Beira, Queen of Winter, she is {{credited}} with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket. In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and is said to be <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the goddesses and gods.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925– July 2, 2013) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor, {{and an early}} computer and Internet pioneer. He {{is best known for}} his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at <b>The</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>All</b> Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} Celtic world Anu {{was the mother}} goddess and {{considered}} to be <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say {{that she is the}} mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is another word for breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: Danu or Don being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and considered to be the ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still looks down on us from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia.|$|E
25|$|When {{ceremonial}} {{or religious}} items are made, {{all aspects of}} the making from materials to colors to designs are important as they are identified with particular gods and meanings. Mesquite and the color reddish brown belong to Tatewari, who is of the earth and the wood of the Brazil tree is related to Tayuapa or “Father Sun.” Symbols such as the golden eagle and macaws are related to Tatewari. Shapes such as the deer, coyote, pine tree or whirlwind can be associated with Tamat’s Kauyumari, who shaped the world. The salate tree, the armadillo and the bear are associated with Takutzi Nakahue, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> gods and of corn. The toto is a small white flower with five petals associated with the rainy season. Sashes and belts often have designs that mimic the markings on the backs of snakes, which are also associated with rain, along with good crops, health and long life. The zigzag lines that emanate from all living things represent communication with the deities. The butterfly motif is reminiscent of the Itzpapolotl or Obsidian Butterfly, a principal deity of the classical Aztecs.|$|E

500|$|In a young colony, {{the queen}} minimises {{reproductive}} competition from workers by suppressing their egg-laying through physical aggression and pheromones. Worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten. Thus, the queen is usually <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> {{of the first}} males laid. Workers eventually begin to lay male eggs {{later in the season}} when the queen's ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes. Because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen, bumblebees are considered [...] "primitively eusocial".|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} family Keable worked during 1921 as an assistant-master at Dulwich College, and served the {{following}} year at Dunstable Grammar School. He continued to write: the manuscript for Simon Called Peter had found a publisher, Michael Sadleir at Constable, who liked its prospects and commissioned from Keable a second novel. He commenced <b>The</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>All</b> Living, [...] "an intense love-drama set in South Africa", which reflected his new interest in African traditional religion and featured a Bergsonian concept of [...] "life-force" [...] {{as an alternative to}} theology.|$|E

500|$|Jethro Tull's {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Ian Anderson {{was surprised when}} critics called the band's previous album, Aqualung (1971), a [...] "concept album". He rejected this, thinking {{it was simply a}} collection of songs, so in response decided to [...] "come up with something that really is <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> concept albums". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E
500|$|The same {{paper had}} {{received}} Keable's second novel, 1922's <b>The</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>All</b> Living, favourably; reviewer Louise Maundell Fields called it [...] "Not only...better from an artistic {{point of view}} ... its general outlook is both steadier and more mature. [...] the book has in {{it so much that}} is well done and worth while that one does not feel inclined to carp at its comparatively few weaknesses." [...] On the whole, other reviews were less favourable. The characters in both Peradventure and Recompense were criticised for lacking depth: reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view. A later book, 1927's Ann Decides, was dismissed succinctly by the Chicago Daily Tribune as [...] "tosh".|$|E
500|$|Kamadhenu ( [...] , , [...] ), {{also known}} as Surabhi ( [...] , [...] ), is a divine bovine-goddess {{described}} in Hinduism as <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> cows. She is a miraculous [...] "cow of plenty" [...] who provides her owner whatever he desires and is often portrayed {{as the mother of}} other cattle as well as the eleven Rudras. In iconography, she is generally depicted as a white cow with a female head and breasts or as a white cow containing various deities within her body. All cows are venerated in Hinduism as the earthly embodiment of the Kamadhenu. As such, Kamadhenu is not worshipped independently as a goddess, and temples are not dedicated to her honor alone; rather, she is honored by the veneration of cows in general throughout the observant Hindu population.|$|E

500|$|Originally a Adivasi (tribal) goddess, Manasa was {{accepted}} in the pantheon worshipped by Hindu lower caste groups. Later, she was included in higher caste Hindu pantheon, where she is now regarded as a Hindu goddess rather than a tribal one. As a Hindu goddess, she was recognised as a daughter of sage Kashyapa and Kadru, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Nāgas. By the 14th century, Manasa was identified as the goddess of fertility and marriage rites and was assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon as a relative of Lord Shiva, as she had a brother-sister bond with Lord Ganesha. Myths glorified her by describing that she saved Shiva after he drank poison, and venerated her as the [...] "remover of poison". Her popularity grew and spread to Southern India, and venerated profusely. As a consequence, stories attributing Manasa's birth to Shiva emerged and ultimately Shaivism adopted this tribal goddess into the Brahmanical tradition of mainstream Hinduism.|$|E
500|$|A {{great deal}} of media {{coverage}} of Simon Called Peter concerned its involvement in a prominent United States court case, over the double murder in New Brunswick, New Jersey of Edward Wheeler Hall, a rector, and Elenor Mills, a married member of his congregation, {{with whom he had}} been conducting an affair. During their courtship Hall had presented Mills with copies of Simon Called Peter, which also featured a romance between a priest and a woman, and <b>The</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>All</b> Living. John Sumner, the secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, seized upon this fact and tried to have the books' American publisher arrested. He claimed that Simon Called Peter could be used to corrupt and seduce the innocent: [...] "Published with a title savouring of religion and written by a clergyman, it had an innocent look which admitted it to society where the ordinary licentious novel could not circulate." [...] A magistrate, declining the request to issue an arrest warrant against the publisher, nonetheless agreed that the book was [...] "nasty" [...] and [...] "particularly objectionable because written by a clergyman." ...|$|E
500|$|The sixth season episode [...] "Weekend At Bobby's" [...] is {{centered}} on Bobby; Sam and Dean are largely relegated to a side-plot while the episode focuses on Bobby's constant working to cover other hunters while also trying to reclaim his soul from Crowley. After a year's research into Crowley's human life—allowing them to track down his mortal remains, whose destruction would 'kill' Crowley {{in the same manner}} as exorcising a ghost—Bobby eventually regains his soul by threatening to burn Crowley's human remains. Although the restored but soulless Sam attempts to kill Bobby in [...] "Appointment in Samarra" [...] as part of a ritual to prevent his soul returning to him—Sam being concerned about reports that the psychological damage his soul will have sustained while being tortured by Lucifer will destroy him—Bobby easily forgives Sam after his soul is restored, recognizing that Sam was not responsible though he is awkward around him at first due to his actions. Bobby then collaborates with the Winchesters in tracking down Eve, <b>the</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> monsters, when she is released from Purgatory by a ritual performed by dragons, even after their first attempt results in Bobby being possessed by a brain-controlling slug Eve has created and the death of his old friend and mentor Rufus in [...] "And Then There Were None".|$|E
