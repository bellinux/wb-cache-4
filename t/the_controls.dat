5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While Official Nintendo Magazine UK editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, {{he felt that the}} multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> 1UP.com editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow Game Informer editor Matthew Kato described <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots.

40|$|Introduction. Macroscopic {{analysis}} {{makes it}} possible to consider <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> process as a whole and go from casual to regular for studies of complex systems and processes. The transition to a qualitatively new level of analysis involves the dynamic models use. In this case it is possible to set <b>the</b> required <b>control</b> time, laws to reduce the entropy of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object, <b>the</b> relationship between the main parameters of <b>the</b> process <b>control.</b> Problem statement. Entropy is the objective characteristic of <b>control</b> precision. <b>The</b> collection of previously collected data on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object, disturbances and other factors form the original information. Working information is extracted in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> process. <b>The</b> required amount of information to reduce <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy it enables to consider the process of radio <b>control</b> in <b>the</b> dynamics. <b>The</b> radio <b>control</b> dynamic model (<b>the</b> dynamic equation), which reveals the laws of change of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy in conditions of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information absence and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information availability necessary to make. It should take into consideration that <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy value and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information amount reaches a certain limit value. The model should give the opportunity {{to take into account the}} basic radio characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object channel. Theoretical results. A dynamic model which takes into account the relationship between the rate of change of control object entropy and the amount of information that goes on <b>the</b> <b>control</b> channel was proposed. The constant rate of object entropy increase in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> absence and <b>the</b> constant rate of object entropy decrease in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> organization were considered. Restrictions on the potentially possible entropy values and the information amount were included. The steady state situation was analyzed. The time during which <b>the</b> <b>control</b> process can be accomplished was established. The requirement to the relation between the entropy potential value and the quantity of information was determined. The relation between the relative error of <b>the</b> radio <b>control,</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy value and the starting information was established. Conclusion. The results make it possible to determine the pattern of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy change, both in terms of receipt control information, and if it is the reduction in a contingency situation. On the basis of the entropy analysis procedures set a limit on <b>the</b> relative radio <b>control</b> errors, required time and the maximum value of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy.
