40|$|Abstract—Ensuring that a Web-based system respects its {{security}} requirements {{is a critical}} issue that has {{become more and more}} difficult to perform in these last years. This difficulty is due to the complexity level of such systems as well as their variety and increasing distribution. To guarantee such a respect, we need to test the target Web system by applying a complete set of test cases covering all the possible scenarios. To reach this aim, we first specify the Web system behavior from its functional point of view using IF language. Second, this model is augmented by applying a set of dedicated algorithms to integrate timed security properties specified in Nomad language. This language is well adapted to express security properties with time constraints. Then, we use a dedicated tool called TestGen-IF, to perform an automatic test generation of test cases targeting security purposes. These test sequences are transformed in executable test cases that can be applied on a real Web application. We present in this paper an industrial Web-based system provided by France <b>Telecom</b> <b>1</b> as a case study to demonstrate the reliability of our framework...|$|E
40|$|We report our {{advances}} in development of subwavelength engineered waveguide structures. This unique NRC patented technology [1, 2] allows synthesis of a metamaterial with an unprecedented control of material properties, constituting {{a powerful tool}} for a designer of photonic integrated circuits. We have demonstrated a number of subwavelength engineered devices operating at telecom wavelengths [3 - 7], for example fibre-chip couplers, waveguide crossings, WDM multiplexers, ultra-fast optical switches, athermal waveguides, evanescent field sensors, polarization rotators, transceiver hybrids and ultra-broadband interference couplers. The subwavelength metamaterial concept has been adopted by industry (IBM) for fibre-chip coupling and subwavelength structures are likely to become key building blocks {{for the next generation of}} integrated photonic circuits. Here we present an overview of recent examples of our subwavelength engineered structures, with an emphasis on couplers for optical interconnects and evanescent field sensors. We demonstrate an unprecedented control over the light coupling between optical fibers and silicon chips by constructing metamaterial couplers operating at <b>telecom</b> (<b>1.</b> 55 3 ̆bcm) and datacom (1. 3 3 ̆bcm) wavelengths. We also show that by subwavelength patterning of silicon-wire waveguides the field delocalization can be engineered to increase the sensitivity of evanescent field waveguide sensors [8].

40|$|Telecommunications {{infrastructure}} {{goes through}} technology-induced phases, and the regulatory regime follows. <b>Telecom</b> <b>1.</b> 0, based on copper wires, was monopolistic in market structure {{and led to}} a Regulation 1. 0 with government ownership or control. Wireless long-distance and then mobile technologies enabled the opening of that system to one of multi-carrier provision, with Regulation 2. 0 stressing privatization, entry, liberalization, and competition. But now, fiber and high-capacity wireless are raising scale economies and network effects, leading to a more concentrated market. At the same time, the rapidly growing importance of infrastructure, coupled with periodic economic instabilities, increase the importance of upgrade investments. All this leads to the return for a larger role for the state in a Regulation 3. 0 which incorporates many elements (though using a different terminology) of the traditional regulatory system [...] universal service, common carriage, cross-subsidies, structural restrictions, industrial policy, even price and profit controls. At the same time, the growing role of telecommunications networks of carriers of mass media and entertainment content will also lead to increasing obligations on network providers to police their networks and assure the maintenance of various societal objectives tied to mass media. These are predictions, not recommendations. ICT Regulation Telecommunications Policy Telecommunications infrastructure Investment Internet...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design and {{implementation}} of a multilayer programmable optically coupled neural network in the Northern <b>Telecom</b> <b>1.</b> 2 μ Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process. The motivation for this work originated from the results obtained from the fabricated implementation of fixed weight optically coupled neural networks in the Northern Telecom 3 μ CMOS process. Previous designs were fabricated and tested with remarkable results. The new design of the optically coupled neural network is a translation of the previous designs from 3 μ to 1. 2 μ CMOS technology with {{the improvement of the}} programmability. The new programmable neural network contains 5 x 5 photosensitive elements as the input devices, 7 neurons, and 112 synaptic weights. Also, the design includes 596 bit memory as the on-chip weight storage. This digital memory, along with other analog circuitries, makes the network a hybrid network. Each synaptic weight is represented by a 5 -bit digital signal, and digital to analog (D/A) conversion is followed for the analog computation. The Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) implementation mask layouts of this network are completely verified. Functionality of the building blocks for the network is proved by the SPICE simulations. The main usage of this network is for the pattern recognition which is currently involved in another industrial research project at the University of Windsor. The programmability of the network provides the feature of multi-set of patterns. It also develops the features of a training loop network.
