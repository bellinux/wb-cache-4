500|$|Fleming wrote Diamonds Are Forever at his Goldeneye {{estate in}} Jamaica in January and February 1955. He {{followed}} his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine, {{in which he}} said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] On completion Fleming wrote to his friend Hilary Bray: ...|$|E
500|$|Fred Frith was a classically-trained violinist {{who turned}} to playing blues guitar while still at school. In 1967 {{he went to}} Cambridge University where he and fellow student, Tim Hodgkinson formed Henry Cow. While at University, Frith read John Cage's , which changed his {{attitude}} to music completely. He realised that [...] "sound, in and of itself, can {{be as important as}} ... melody and harmony and rhythm." [...] This changed his approach to the guitar, [...] "just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could get out of it", and initiated a long period of experimentation that continued throughout Frith's musical career.|$|E
500|$|In May 1963 Fleming wrote a {{piece for}} Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] Benson identified {{what he described as}} the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E

500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} mentioned to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Fleming and {{his wife}} arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] As he had done with Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that [...] "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On {{a trip to the}} US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS Queen Elizabeth to correct the proofs of the novel.|$|E
500|$|In June 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming began a {{collaboration}} with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, Commander Jamaica, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. [...] When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea {{as the basis for}} Dr. No. By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953—Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever. A fifth, From Russia, with Love, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By the time he returned to London in late February, he had completed a 206-page first draft, which he initially titled The Wound Man.|$|E

5000|$|By October 2010, Cilmi {{had already}} begun work on her third studio album. She has been quoted as saying: [...] "It's totally {{exciting}} because I am spending a bit more time with this record. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> works. <b>I</b> really love Dolly Parton, roots music, Tricky and Enya, so anything could happen." ...|$|R
500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that {{he felt like he}} was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily {{than any of his}} other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse is in a very bad way... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E

I wrote to Robert Cushman, The Observer′s theatre critic, to find out exactly how the event was organized, and asked Ruth Goetz, a council-member who lived in London at the time, to do some detective work at the Court. She came up with the key to it all: a fellow named Gerald Chapman”.|$|E

2500|$|From January 2002, until {{sometime}} in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to Father's Rights campaigners, {{and it was}} reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. [...] He said, [...] "I am heartbroken. I just cannot believe what happens to people, what is done to them {{in the name of the}} law. You only have to open your eyes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call the 'Sad Dads on Sundays Syndrome'". [...] He has also called for The Children Act to be repealed and his latest statement to Father's Rights campaigners was, [...] "It's not in my nature to shut up".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou [...] "(it) {{was really}} {{like a kind of}} little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Jackson {{released}} her self-titled debut album. In order to distinguish herself from her famous brothers, The Jacksons, La Toya only wanted {{her first name}} on the album. [...] "I begged just to have it 'La Toya'. But my father said, 'It's your last name. You got to use it.' But I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could do as an individual." [...] The first single [...] "If You Feel the Funk", became a modest hit, climbing into the Top 40 of the US R chart. Her second single, [...] "Night Time Lover", was produced by younger brother Michael, who provided backing vocals. In turn, she provided the opening scream on her brothers', The Jacksons, 1980 hit, [...] "This Place Hotel" [...] as well as backing vocals on brother Michael's 1984 solo hit [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)".|$|E

2500|$|Some had {{wondered}} if Tiner's liberal newspaper editorials had cost him potential {{votes in the}} congressional race. Tiner {{said that he had}} not expected his editorials to become a campaign issue. When the editorials became part of the campaign, Tiner called himself [...] "a conservative with a heart", a designation like what George W. Bush would late dub as [...] "compassionate conservatism". When Tiner was questioned about a change in his position to support navigation of the Red River and American aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, he said that the previous opposition to both proposals came from the Shreveport Journal editorial board, not himself: [...] "The Shreveport Journal is not running for Congress. ... I'm coming out from behind the printing press ... two years from now the people will be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peterson {{believed}} he was a player that a franchise could build around. In an interview with IGN following the NFL Draft, he said, [...] "I'm a player who is coming in with the determination to turn a team around. I want to help my team get to the playoffs, win...and run wild. I want to bring people to the stands. I want {{people to come to}} the game <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can do next. Things like that can change the whole attitude of an organization. I want to win." [...] He later told the Star Tribune in an interview, [...] "I want to be the best player to ever play this game." [...] Nearly three months after being drafted, he was signed by the Vikings on July 29, 2007. His contract was worth $40.5 million over five years, with $17 million guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, {{but he wants to}} make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, {{she began}} hinting that {{she was working on}} new {{material}} for her next album. The following year, on 18 May 2008, it was announced that [...] "Amebo" [...] would be the first single to be released from the album. According to Muma Gee, this song was what she had long desired to create: [...] "I have been doing my own thing. I've been experimenting even while at the University of Port Harcourt. Now, I want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can achieve professionally." [...] Explaining what [...] "Amebo" [...] was specifically about, she says, [...] "I am a homegirl, I am an indigenous musician. I believe so much in Nigeria. So, [...] "Amebo" [...] simply talks about our people, our values, and our heritage." [...] On 25 May, Muma Gee premiered the song at an exclusive night party in Ikoyi. Other roles she played at the event included meeting fans, and signing autographs. [...] "Amebo" [...] was sent to radio afterwards; Muma Gee also spoke briefly about the new album's content and direction, saying, [...] "I figured out that there are lots of love songs in the album. Maybe I am learning the rules to falling in love. (Laughs) and it's finding interest in my songwriting, maybe, maybe not, well I am not sure." ...|$|E
