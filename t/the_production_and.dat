5|$|After Stuart Urban left <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> the {{decision}} {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} minor traces of Punic-Phoenician and Romano-Italian influence, the Delian mosaics {{generally}} {{conform to the}} major trends found in Hellenistic art. The same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and sculptures at Delos may have also been involved in hiring mosaic artists from abroad. Delian mosaics share certain characteristics with mosaics {{in other parts of}} the Greek world, such as Macedonian mosaics in Pella. They also share some attributes with Greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black-background technique found in red-figure pottery of the Classical period. Some of the styles and techniques used at Delos were later found in Roman art and mosaics, although contemporary Roman examples from Pompeii, for instance, reveal significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> design of mosaics in the western versus eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, Richard D'Oyly Carte, who {{was then}} {{managing}} the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro, brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled Trial by Jury. This proved a success, and in 1876 D'Oyly Carte assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera.

As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit.
