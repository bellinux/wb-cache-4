The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on the negative side, corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mainline}} Protestant churches, the Presbyterian Church in the USA was {{a founding member}} of the Federal Council of Churches (a predecessor to the National Council of Churches) in 1908.

From 1918 to 1920, the church participated in a short-lived international ecumenical organization called the Interchurch World Movement.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century.

5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west {{give the impression of}} a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub.

5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower for <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had {{to be added to}} support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households.

5|$|In Christian theology, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit {{under the}} Old Covenant {{is viewed as}} less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated {{on the day of}} Pentecost.

Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
