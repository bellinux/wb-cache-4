5|$|A {{few days}} later, Bokassa had Banza's {{wife and their}} nine {{children}} arrested and deported to Berbérati and then Birao. They were released on 6 May 1971. Banza's mistress, Julienne Kombo, who entered the Palais de la Renaissance crying hysterically after her lover's death, was arrested and jailed until 24 June 1972. Banza's father was sent to jail, where he died of hunger and exhaustion on 24 April 1970 at Ngaragba Central Prison. Banza's two younger brothers, Beuoane and Gouboulo, were dismissed from the gendarmerie in July and sent to Ngaragba Prison. In August 1971, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> from the prison, never to be seen again.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{increase}} in the number of NCMP seats in Parliament to nine in 2010, since the Workers' Party garnered six seats at the 2011 general election, three NCMP seats were offered. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> up by Lina Loh from the Singapore People's Party who contested in Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency (SMC), and Yee Jenn Jong and Gerald Giam of the Workers' Party who contested in Joo Chiat SMC and East Coast GRC respectively.|$|E
5|$|George Toogood Smith (1903 – 5 June 1955) was the {{maternal}} uncle, through marriage, of John Lennon. Smith operated his family's two dairy farms and a retail outlet with his brother, Frank Smith, {{in the village}} of Woolton, Liverpool. The farms had been in the Smith family for four generations, but after the start of World War II, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> over by the British Government for war work.|$|E

Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he had written the preceding part of his monograph; later, Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877, but Ray asserted that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> before 1874. No specimens have been collected since.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the recall of the state militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1958 Canadian Pacific Air Lines took {{delivery}} {{of the first of}} six Model 314 Britannias, with an additional two Model 324s (built to a 320 standard) arriving later and sold to Cathay Pacific in 1961. BOAC ordered seven Model 302s but never took delivery, instead <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> on by airlines including Aeronaves de México and Ghana Airways. The main long-range series were the 310s, of which BOAC took 18 and, after deliveries began in September 1957, put them into service between London and New York City; in March 1964 BOAC owned 50 aircraft, 10 being Britannia 312s. BOAC's last scheduled Britannia flight was April 1965.|$|E

5|$|The French {{defeat at}} Sedan left the Allied Army Groups in Belgium with sparse flank protection. The German attack, {{especially}} the breakout from the bridgeheads at Sedan, was {{so fast that}} there were hardly any major combats. Many French soldiers were in such shock that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner before they could offer resistance, which also explains the low casualty rates for both sides. The two assault engineer battalions under Korthals achieved the most important success. By eliminating the bunkers in the Bellevue sector, they made the breakthroughs of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions possible. This was achieved without a single casualty.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} transport to Mæl {{was performed by}} connecting passenger wagons to the freight trains. Up to ten trains were operated each direction each day, and up to five would correspond with the ferry; at Tinnoset trains would operate to Skien, and connection at Hjuksebø allowed for transport to Oslo Vestbanestasjon. In 1928 Norsk Transport and NSB agreed to operate a weekly night train service from Rjukan to Oslo; the service lasted until 1933. During the 1930s NSB and Norsk Hydro initiated an attempt to attract tourists to Rjukan, through discounted direct trains from Oslo, Drammen and Skien. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> up again after the war, and remained until 1969.|$|E
5|$|Belugas {{were the}} first whales {{to be kept in}} captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at Barnum's Museum in New York City in 1861. For most of the 20th century, Canada was the {{predominant}} source of wild belugas. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the Churchill River estuary until capture was banned in 1992. Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada. Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi, or exported to other countries, such as Canada. Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.|$|E

5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> to the epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he}} was able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{decided that}} he could gain little by {{continuing}} to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, {{and that there were}} easier pickings for his army in the Kingdom of Poland. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners back over to his erstwhile coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch FrancisII, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans called for the system to open in 1966, with the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø Line and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway, and the new Furuset Line and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third-rail power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways in Oslo. The first units in the T1000 series were two single-car prototypes designated T. They were test-run on the existing tramways from 1959 to 1960, and were then put into service on the Kolsås Line. Prone to technical faults, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> out of regular service in 1982.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1941, the battalion, less 'D' Company which {{travelled}} {{west for}} home leave, entrained at Oakbank, near to Woodside, South Australia {{where they had}} moved the previous February. From there, the battalion travelled overland to Sydney where they embarked upon the SS Ile de France from Pyrmont Wharf, bound for the Middle East, {{as part of a}} large convoy of troopships. Sailing via Fremantle where 'D' Company rejoined the battalion, they sailed on to Colombo, which was reached in late April, where the troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel. Departing again in early May, they continued on alone, crossing the Red Sea in a week and making landfall at Port Tewfik. The troops had to endure a two-day wait before disembarkation whereupon <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> to {{the eastern side of the}} Suez Canal by lighter and then transferred by train to Kantara.|$|E
5|$|In the Georgian period Bath {{had grown}} in {{popularity}} as a spa town. The opening of Pulteney Bridge enabled {{the development of}} Bathwick and land {{to the east of}} the River Avon. The pools were built next to the river on the site of old marl pits. The developers went bankrupt ten years after opening the pools but they were sold had operated privately until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> over by the local corporation in the 1890s. They then operated as a public swimming baths until the 1970s. The pool closed in 1984 and was used for a short time as a trout farm before closure and falling into disrepair. In 2005 a trust was formed to raise funds for renovation and reopening of the pools. Public support and grants from bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund have aided regeneration of the site, which is expected to reopen in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Indications {{are that}} society in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from their masters, many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.|$|E
