He served three terms as President of Silpakorn University from 1965 to 1971, during which he founded the university's Sanam Chandra Palace Campus.

5|$|In 1606 Żółkiewski {{returned}} to Ukraine, where he defeated the Tatars {{at the battle}} of Udycz. Later that year he decided to support the king during the Zebrzydowski's Rebellion. His decision was not an obvious one, as his mentor Zamoyski opposed the king. Additionally, Żółkiewski was related to the Zebrzydowski family and was sympathetic to some of the rebels' arguments. In the battle of Guzów he commanded the left flank of the royal forces, but his troops took relatively little part in the battle. Unimpressed with Żółkiewski's performance, the king did not give him not the Grand Crown Hetmanship that he coveted, although he was appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voivode of Kiev.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the United States in July 1920, Somervell {{was posted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C. His war record {{earned him a}} place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, {{reserved}} for the Army's best and most promising officers. He once again ranked near the top of his class. After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist Hines with a special study of navigation on the Rhine and Danube Rivers on behalf of the League of Nations, essentially a continuation of the work that the two men had done in 1920. He then attended the Army War College from 1925 to 1926.|$|E
5|$|Styer {{graduated}} from Fort Humphreys in June 1920, and was posted to the Massachusetts National Guard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{where he was}} promoted to major again on 10 February 1921.

More Indian music was also scheduled for inclusion in the medley. Paul McCartney was to be the ceremony's closing act.|$|E

50|$|Typically men are ordained <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> {{a priest}} in the Aaronic priesthood {{approximately}} one year prior to ordination as an elder in the Melchizedek priesthood.

5|$|Caulfield grew up {{with his}} parents, Henry P.

He {{attended}} the California Institute of Technology, Lingnan University, Canton, China, and Oxford University, England before earning his undergraduate degree at Harvard College in Government and Economics in 1940, an MPA degree from Harvard University's Littauer School of Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government) in 1949 and completing his comprehensive examination for the Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government there in 1950. He began his public service career as an economist with the Works Projects Administration (1940–41) before serving in the U.S. Navy, where he was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Secretary (1942–45) and received a Commendation Award from the Secretary of the Navy, eventually retiring as Lieutenant Commander. He served briefly as Executive Assistant to the Director, White House Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion in 1946, before being named Assistant for International Affairs to the Assistant Director for Statistical Standards of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget (1946–48), predecessor of the current Office of Management and Budget.

5|$|During Western Han, the Minister of Finance's {{powers were}} limited to the public treasury, the Minister Steward being {{responsible}} for the emperor's private wealth. However, in Eastern Han, the responsibilities for the public treasury and the emperor's private wealth were amalgamated and entrusted solely to the Minister of Finance, which later proved disastrous when handled by irresponsible emperors such as Ling (r. 168–189 AD). During Western Han, the Minister of Finance managed the government's monopolized salt and iron agencies, which were abolished during Eastern Han and transferred to local administrations and private entrepreneurship. He also managed the government's brief monopoly over liquor from 98–81 BC, before it was returned to private production. Although the Minister Steward and then the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks managed the imperial mint for issuing standard coins during Western Han, in Eastern Han the imperial mint was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minister of Finance.|$|E
5|$|In August 1907, MacArthur {{was sent}} to the {{engineer}} district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to Fort Leavenworth, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion adjutant in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at San Antonio, Texas, with the Maneuver Division in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to care for their mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near Johns Hopkins Hospital. Army Chief of Staff, Major General Leonard Wood, took up the matter with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Staff in 1912.|$|E

5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E
5|$|With the {{turnover}} of Point Cypress and Point Marone to South Vietnamese navy on 15 August 1970, Squadron One and its remaining division, Division 13, were decommissioned. Over 3,000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965. Administrative and liaison functions {{that had been}} {{carried out by the}} Squadron One staff were turned over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senior Coast Guard Officer, Vietnam (SCGOV). Several officers of Squadron One were assigned temporary duties as advisors to former Squadron One cutters to further assist the new RVN commanding officers in their new duties. The Coast Guard continued to provide technical assistance and training under the SCATTOR/VECTOR programs for the SVN after Squadron One was disestablished through the formation of four Technical Assistance Groups. Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven engineers reporting to SCGOV. The groups were located at Da Nang where there were six cutters assigned; Cam Ranh Bay, six cutters; Vung Tau, eight cutters; and An Thoi, six cutters. As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended, U.S. Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties.|$|E
