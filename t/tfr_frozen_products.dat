40|$|The {{absolute}} price {{version of}} the Rotterdam model {{was used in the}} estimation of U. S. catfish demand where catfish was differentiated by product cut (whole, fillet, and other) and product form (fresh and frozen). Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine the importance of product form in demand (product form aggregation). Likelihood ratio tests were also used to determine if fresh products were separable from <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> (product form separability). Product form aggregation was rejected at a probability of 0. 999, suggesting that fresh and <b>frozen</b> catfish <b>products</b> are not homogenous. The hypothesis, no product form separability, failed to be rejected at the 0. 05 significance level, but was rejected at the 0. 01 significance level. Test results suggest that it is more acceptable to focus on a single product group (e. g., <b>frozen</b> <b>products)</b> than to assume that catfish products are perfectly aggregatable across product forms.

In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> for the Canadian market.

40|$|Background. Legumes {{are usually}} {{consumed}} when physiologically mature, as dry seeds, however, flageolet beans seeds are also consumed immature. They are harvested when {{dry matter content}} is about 40 %, pods are filled, grown, seeds succulent, showing green or light green colour and do not require lengthy thermal processing when prepared for con-sumption. Material and methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate vitamin C content in imma-ture seeds of five bean cultivars harvested when dry matter content was 40 %. The analysis included raw, blanched and cooked fresh seeds and three products prepared for consump-tion after 0, 4, 8 and 12 months of storage: <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> obtained using the traditional method (blanching–freezing–frozen storage–cooking), <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> obtained using a modified method (cooking–freezing–frozen storage–thawing and heating in a micro-wave oven), a ready-to-eat product to consumption at ambient temperature, and canned products obtained by sterilization. Results. The application of technological processes, <b>frozen</b> and sterilized <b>products</b> stor-age, and the preparation for consumption had a cumulative effect in retention vitamin C content on final <b>products.</b> Conclusion. Comparing <b>frozen</b> seeds obtained by modified method with seeds treated by traditional method, generally, this one could retain more vitamin C. Canned seeds retained significantly less vitamin C than other <b>frozen</b> <b>products.</b> Key words: flageolet bean seeds, vitamin C, cooking, freezing, frozen storage, cannin...|$|R

Microwave treatment of banana slices at 650 watts for 2 min or immersion of whole peeled fruits {{in boiling water}} for 11 min followed by freezing at - 24 °C inhibited color deterioration in the <b>frozen</b> <b>product.</b> Treatments showed different effectiveness depending on the enzymatic system studied [polyphenoloxidase (PPO) or peroxidase (POD) ] and banana maturity level at the processing date.

40|$|Abstract. Green pea is {{regarded}} as an important constituent of a human diet, especially for vegetarians. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the amino acids content in green pea {{and the quality of}} pea protein. The study covered raw seeds; fresh seeds cooked to consumption consistency; and two kinds of <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> prepared for consumption: frozen seeds obtained using the traditional method and frozen seeds of the ready-to-eat type. Compared with the raw material, cooked fresh pea contained more isoleucine (15 %), valine (14 %) and arginine (24 %) but less tyrosine (17 %); cooked pea from the traditional <b>frozen</b> <b>product</b> contained less sulphur-containing amino acids (12 %) and alanine (13 %); while pea from the <b>frozen</b> <b>product</b> of the ready-to-eat type contained a similar or higher amount (from 12 % to 38 %) of amino acids, except for sulphur-containing amino acids (less 12 %). The protein of green pea was of very good quality, both in raw seeds and in those prepared for consumption. In comparison with the FAO/WHO/ 1991 standard, the CS indexes exceeded 100. It was only for sulphuric amino acids that the CS for the ready-to-eat product was 98.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bulletin}} is to provide authentic information on the selection, preparation and utilization {{of fruits and vegetables}} preserved under frozen food locker systems in Iowa. The recommendations are based on investigations under locker plant conditions conducted over a period of 4 years by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station. In order that the products would be comparable to those obtained by using ordinary household equipment, preparation and processing was done on a small scale in a kitchen laboratory to simulate home conditions. 2 Careful attention was given to details of necessary measures preparatory to freezing as well as to subsequent procedures. The methods herein described have been found to yield <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> of excellent quality.
