40|$|Abstract—Power bus structure, {{consisting}} of two parallel solid power and ground planes separated by an insulator, behaves as a cavity resonator at high frequencies. Noise on the power bus, due to a sudden change in the current drawn by an active component, can appear as an undesired spatial fluctuation in the voltage be-tween power and ground, especially at resonant frequencies of the resultant cavity, which may lead to problems in signal integrity, excessive delays, false switching, and radiated emission. These res-onances can be suppressed by introducing high-frequency loss into the structure. This paper investigates a simple method to reduce self-/transfer impedance of power/ground planes for mitigating power/ground bounce in high-speed printed circuit board design by adding {{a thin layer of}} magnetic material coating to the inside-facing surfaces of copper power and ground plates to increase their effective high-frequency surface impedance. The increased surface impedance will increase the attenuation constant of the propagat-ing wave inside the cavity that benefits reduction of cavity’s quality factor (Q factor). The simulation results obtained from a modified cavity resonator model show that increasing surface impedance can dramatically reduce self- and <b>transfer</b> <b>impedances</b> at board resonant frequencies.
