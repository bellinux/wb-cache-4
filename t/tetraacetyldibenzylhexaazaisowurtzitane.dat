40|$|Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL- 20) is {{the most}} {{powerful}} non-nuclear explosive in the world. Herein, a greener and safer new one-pot method for the synthesis of CL- 20 from <b>tetraacetyldibenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane</b> (TADB) has been developed through zeolite/ 98 % HNO 3. The H-ZSM- 5 catalyst, with both Br√∏nsted and Lewis acid sites, indicated higher catalytic activity. The reaction using H-ZSM- 5 has been optimized with respect to reaction temperature, reaction time, amount of acid and amount of catalyst to substrate ratio...|$|E
