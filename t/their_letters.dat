5|$|The {{recording}} of the transit is {{seen by many as}} the birth of modern astronomy in Britain. John Flamsteed later said he regarded Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and Kepler. and began his three folio volume, Historia Coelestis Britannica (1745) by printing five pages of <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> and observations made between 1638 and 1643.|$|E
5|$|A curved line {{of stars}} {{comprising}} Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis {{was seen as}} a boat by the ancient Arabs. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated 27 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too dim to warrant <b>their</b> <b>letters.</b> A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.|$|E
5|$|He {{also sought}} the {{opinions}} {{of many of the}} astronomers to whom he had sent Mysterium, among them Reimarus Ursus (Nicolaus Reimers Bär)—the imperial mathematician to Rudolph II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the Tychonic system with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through <b>their</b> <b>letters,</b> Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.|$|E

5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{continued}} to treat potential romantic partners with caution. In 1828, she met and flirted with the French writer Prosper Mérimée, but her one surviving letter to him {{appears to be}} a deflection of his declaration of love. She was delighted when her old friend from Italy, Edward Trelawny, returned to England, and they joked about marriage in <b>their</b> <b>letters.</b> Their friendship had altered, however, following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley; and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of Queen Mab from Percy Shelley's poems. Oblique references in her journals, from the early 1830s until the early 1840s, suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician Aubrey Beauclerk, who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian scripts are {{the three}} writing systems used to write the Georgian language: Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are unicase, <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> share the same names and {{alphabetical}} order, and are written horizontally from left to right. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli was once the civilian royal script of the Kingdom of Georgia mostly used for the royal charters {{and is now the}} standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon learned their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E
5|$|When Lord Melbourne loses {{a vote in}} Parliament, the new Prime Minister designate, Sir Robert Peel, {{wishes to}} replace some of her ladies-in-waiting with {{supporters}} {{of his own party}} and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 2010, Miller and Bello jointly {{announced}} on ESPNU {{that they would}} attend Baylor University. In August 2010, Scout.com had named Miller their number two prospect in the country behind Anthony Davis. At {{the time of the}} announcement, Miller was the top-ranked high school class of 2011 power forward in the nation according to Rivals.com and the number two prospect in the nation behind Gilchrist according to PrepStars Rob Harrington, who had thought he might go to Louisville. In November, Miller and Bello signed <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> of intent. At the time he signed his letter of intent, he was ranked the 2nd best player in the nation by Scout.com and PrepStar, while Rivals.com listed him fifth. In 2011, Big12Sports.com has repeatedly described Miller as a potential Top 10 draft pick. As an incoming freshman for the 2011–12 Bears, he was one of five Big 12 Conference players named to the Naismith College Player of the Year preseason top 50 watchlist. Baylor entered the season without 2011–12 Big 12 Conference basketball season preseason player of the year Perry Jones who was on a five-game suspension for having accepted improper benefits before arriving at Baylor. Nonetheless, Dime Magazine included Miller, Jones and Bello in its list of Top 25 Breakout Players & Teams To Watch In The NBA, College & High School This Season.|$|E

5|$|The {{resident}} supercargo {{was responsible}} for buying goods such as tea, porcelain, silk, arrack, sago and miscellaneous for the next ship arriving from Sweden. The SOIC traded mainly with the Chinese merchant Puankhequa, who had his factory next to the Swedish, and judging from <b>their</b> <b>letters,</b> Puankhequa and Grill became friends. Grill was entrusted with funds from the SOIC for buying tea and other goods during off-season when the price was at its lowest. He bought most of the tea from Puankhequa, and several contracts are preserved. However, he did not buy the tea from the Chinese merchant on the SOIC's behalf but instead bought it through his own company and sold {{it on to the}} SOIC at a slightly higher price. After some time the SOIC became suspicious and director David Sandberg was sent to Canton to investigate the matter in 1766. Grill and his companions, Grubb and Hahr, had to sign an agreement not to misuse their position within the SOIC. In 1768, Grill was ordered to return home as supercargo on the ship Cron Prins Gustaf. Even so, Hahr stayed behind in Canton, continued their business and was able to transfer Grill's share of the profit through international bank notes.|$|E
5|$|Scottish privateers and pirates preyed on {{shipping}} in the North Sea {{and off the}} Atlantic {{coast of}} France. Scotland's Admiralty court judged whether a captured ship was a lawful prize and dealt with the recovery of goods. As the court was entitled to {{a tenth of the}} value of a prize, it was a profitable business for the admiral. The privateers Andrew and Robert Barton were still using <b>their</b> <b>letters</b> of reprisal of 1506 against the Portuguese in 1561. The Bartons operated down the east coast of Britain from Leven and the Firth of Forth, while others used the French Channel ports such as Rouen and Dieppe or the Atlantic port of Brest as bases. During the Rough Wooing in 1542, the Mary Willoughby, the Lion, and the Salamander under the command of John Barton, son of Robert Barton, attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby. They later blockaded a London merchant ship called the Antony of Bruges in a creek on the coast of Brittany. In 1544 Edinburgh was attacked by an English marine force and burnt. The Salamander and the Scottish-built Unicorn were captured at Leith. The Scots still had two royal naval vessels and numerous smaller private vessels, but would have to rely on privateers until the re-establishment of a royal fleet in the 1620s. When, {{as a result of the}} series of international treaties, the emperor Charles V declared war upon Scotland in 1544, the Scots were able to engage in a highly profitable campaign of privateering that lasted six years and the gains of which probably outweighed the losses in trade with the Low Countries. They also operated in the West Indies from the 1540s, joining the French in the capture of Burburuta in 1567. English and Scottish naval warfare and privateering broke out sporadically in the 1550s. In 1559, English captain William Winter was sent north with 34 ships and dispersed and captured the Scottish and French fleets, leading to the eventual evacuation of the French from Scotland, and a successful coup of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Scottish and English interests were re-aligned and the naval conflict subsided.|$|E
