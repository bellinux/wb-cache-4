500|$|Various {{systems are}} under {{development}} at present aimed at harnessing the enormous potential available for wave power off Scotland's coasts. Pelamis Wave Power (previously Ocean Power Delivery) are an Edinburgh-based company whose Pelamis {{system has been}} tested off Orkney and Portugal. Their second generation P2 Pelamis machines are [...] long and [...] diameter. Five tubes joined together by hinged joints float semi-submerged {{on the surface of}} the ocean and move relative to each other as waves pass down the length of the machine. This motion is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which drive generators inside the machine to produce electricity.

40|$|GENI Project: GE is {{developing}} new, low-cost insulation for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) electricity <b>transmission</b> <b>cables.</b> The current material used to insulate HVDC <b>transmission</b> <b>cables</b> {{is very expensive}} and can account {{for as much as}} 1 / 3 of the total cost of a high-voltage transmission system. GE is embedding nanomaterials into specialty rubber to create its insulation. Not only are these materials less expensive than those used in conventional HVDC insulation, but also they will help suppress excess charge accumulation. The excess charge left behind on a cable poses a major challenge for high-voltage insulation—if it’s not kept to a low level, it could ultimately lead the insulation to fail. GE’s low-cost insulation is compatible with existing U. S. cable manufacturing processes, further enhancing its cost effectiveness...|$|R
