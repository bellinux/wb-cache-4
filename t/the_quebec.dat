5|$|The Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{established}} First Nation treaty rights, {{created the}} Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed <b>the</b> <b>Quebec</b> Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, <b>the</b> <b>Quebec</b> Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration {{at a time}} that the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and <b>the</b> <b>Quebec</b> Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart. The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. At <b>the</b> <b>Quebec</b> Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed <b>the</b> <b>Quebec</b> Agreement, which merged the two national projects. <b>The</b> <b>Quebec</b> Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate their efforts.
