5|$|After Georgian {{troops had}} left Tskhinvali on 10 August, the Russians indiscriminately bombed the {{civilian}} areas in Gori on 11 August. The Georgian forces withdrew from Gori on 11 August. A Georgian {{official said that}} <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> ordered to secure Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. By late 11 August, most remaining inhabitants and Georgian troops had abandoned Gori. Georgian president Saakashvili stated that Russians had split Georgia into two by occupying an important crossroad near Gori.|$|E
5|$|Birdwood {{planned to}} arrive off the {{peninsula}} after the moon had set, {{with the first}} troops landing at 03:30, an hour before dawn. He declined the offer of an old merchant ship, loaded with troops, being deliberately grounded at Gaba Tepe. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> to travel in naval and merchant ships, transferring to rowing boats towed by small steamboats to make the assault.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Troop</b> <b>was</b> officially named: <b>The</b> FIRST DHAKA, St. Gregory's Troop..NUMBER ONE. The {{date on the}} Approval was 7 May 1914. The Scoutmaster was Mr. Harnett. The total {{strength}} of <b>the</b> <b>Troop</b> <b>was</b> forty boys, as of 27 April 1914.|$|R
5000|$|New Zealand {{also contributed}} a {{wireless}} <b>troop</b> to <b>the</b> Mesopotamian Campaign. <b>The</b> Wireless <b>Troop</b> <b>was</b> formed in New Zealand {{and arrived at}} Basra in April 1916. In Mesopotamia <b>the</b> New Zealand <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> amalgamated with <b>the</b> 1st Australian Wireless Signal Squadron, forming [...] "C" [...] Wireless <b>Troop</b> of <b>the</b> Anzac Squadron. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> much affected by disease, but once in operation {{was attached to the}} Cavalry Division in the assault on Baghdad. <b>The</b> Wireless <b>Troop</b> <b>was</b> among <b>the</b> first batch of <b>troops</b> to enter <b>the</b> city on 11 March 1917. <b>The</b> Wireless <b>Troop</b> joined further operations in Mesopotamia and was then moved to Persia. In June 1917, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> redirected to France, where it was absorbed into the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company.|$|R
5|$|In 1944, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> sent to Yugoslavia, {{where it}} raided {{numerous}} Dalmatian islands {{held by the}} Germans. In the Autumn of 1944, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> part of Operation Infatuate to capture the island of Walcheren {{at the head of}} the Scheldt Estuary, alongside Free Norwegian and British Commandos. The unit later moved into Germany.|$|R
5|$|During the winter, they {{fortified}} their defenses {{around the}} southern peninsula of Hakodate, {{with the new}} fortress of Goryōkaku at the center. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> organized under a Franco-Japanese command, the commander-in-chief Ōtori Keisuke being seconded by the French captain Jules Brunet, and divided between four brigades. Each of these was commanded by a French non-commissioned officer (Fortant, Marlin, Cazeneuve, Bouffier), and were themselves divided into eight half-brigades, each under Japanese command.|$|E
5|$|In late September {{and early}} October 1991, the {{blockade}} of JNA barracks {{in and around}} Karlovac and Croatian defences in the city were maintained by about 900 police and ZNG troops. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the 110th Infantry Brigade and the under-strength 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The 110th Infantry Brigade, at one-third of its planned strength due to poor organisation and a shortage of weapons, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolf Brlečić.|$|E
5|$|Military {{strategy}} and military training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt {{at the sound of}} bells and drums.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> one of {{only two}} fully uniformed militia units to rally to the flag with the threat of unrest and {{rebellion}} within the colony, in 1837. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> given new uniforms, fully armed and redesignated the [...] "Queens Light Dragoons" [...] (QLD). Operating alongside <b>the</b> local Markham <b>Troop,</b> forming a squadron, the QLD participated in a number of actions during the rebellion to include Gallows Hill, Navy Island and Town of Scotland. <b>The</b> Toronto <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> on active service for several months during this crisis.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> {{reactivated}} on 13 February 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts. However, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> {{did not see}} {{any significant}} actions during its post war years, still {{a part of the}} 94th Infantry Division, which itself was never called on for service. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> moved to Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1953, remaining there for another six years as an inactive reserve unit until 1959, when it was again disbanded and inactivated.|$|R

5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons. However, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> not {{briefed on the}} operation until {{a few hours before}} it was launched. They then linked up with their transport aircraft, including the ten-man gliders that would deliver the glider-borne troops onto their objectives. By 24 May, all preparations for the airborne assault were complete.|$|E
5|$|On March 27 {{the eight}} soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians {{who were in}} the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder. Bostonians {{continued}} to be hostile to the troops and their dependents. General Gage, convinced <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> doing more harm than good, ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May. Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British. After the British were in the hollow way, the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 more men. All of <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> stationed {{too far away from}} one another to do much damage.|$|E
50|$|On 15 January 2011, three U.S. <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> {{killed in}} Iraq.

5|$|The {{morning of}} 16 August was {{relatively}} quiet, {{with only a}} few attempts made by small German parties to approach the Canadian lines. After having failed to capture all their objectives the previous day and having postponed additional attacks a number of times, the 2nd Canadian Brigade attacked and captured the remainder of its final objective line on the afternoon of 16 August. The assault lasted a little over an hour but <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> then forced to defend against a dozen German counter-attacks during the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Echoes follows bounty hunter Samus Aran after she {{is sent to}} rescue Galactic Federation Marines from a ship near Aether, a planet {{inhabited}} by a race known as the Luminoth. There, she discovers that <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> slaughtered by the Ing, a race that came from an alternate dimension of Aether. Samus must travel to three temples to ensure {{the destruction of the}} Ing, while battling Space Pirates and her mysterious doppelgänger called Dark Samus.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> {{told that}} they were to gather up all their {{ammunition}} and baggage and prepare for a night attack. By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for evacuation. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts men, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops.|$|E
60|$|In {{accordance}} with this plan <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> divided, and each portion rode off at full speed.|$|R
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Lieutenant (later Captain) Robert Hill, {{initially}} <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> deployed with only eight carriers as {{at the start of}} the Australian commitment to the ground war in Vietnam, the Australian government intended to limit the size of Australia's forces to a single infantry battalion tasked with maintaining security around the American base at Bien Hoa. In September, however, as it became clearer that there was a wider role for Australian ground forces the size of <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> increased to 13 personnel carriers and two mortar carriers and after that <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> <b>was</b> used in a variety of roles including infantry mobility, manoeuvre, direct and indirect fire support, casualty evacuation and providing a medium lift stores transportation capability.|$|R

5|$|Wojtek was a bear {{adopted in}} Iran by the Polish II Corps and enlisted into the 22nd Artillery Supply Company {{to allow him}} to travel when <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> posted.

5|$|A {{string of}} forts was {{constructed}} in the north-east (some of which may date from the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely {{known to have been}} permanently occupied during this incursion before <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> withdrawn again to Hadrian's Wall circa 213. There is some evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the troops}} {{went to the}} nearby village of Saint-Philippe, where they stayed {{overnight}} and received assistance from the townspeople. Captain Holland contacted C. W. Bennett, the British Consul at Saint-Denis, and they secured passage to Mauritius on the SS Lalpoora, located at Pointe des Galets. After brief stops in Saint-Joseph and St. Pierre, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> transported to Pointe des Galets by train. The Lalpoora left Réunion on the mid-afternoon of 17 January, and they arrived in Mauritius early the next morning. The officers of Warren Hastings were praised for the discipline and bravery of the troops involved in the evacuation; however, Captain Holland had to face a court martial for losing the ship; he was reprimanded and subsequently acquitted.|$|E

5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{combined}} size of the French Army of the Levant divisions that participated in the battle ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 troops. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> <b>were</b> mostly made up of Senegalese and Algerian units, and consisted of ten infantry battalions {{and a number of}} cavalry and artillery units. Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Algerian Riflemen Regiment, the Senegalese Division, the African Riflemen Regiment and the Moroccan Sipahi Battalion. A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well. The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns, and backed by tanks and fighter bombers. The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1955 {{there was}} also a {{directly}} registered [...] "mixed nationality" [...] Scout <b>troop</b> at <b>the</b> RAF Union School in Habbaniya, Iraq. <b>The</b> <b>Troop</b> <b>was</b> associated with <b>the</b> Union School which had a student body consisting primarily of Assyrian students, with an Armenian minority and a few Indian students.
