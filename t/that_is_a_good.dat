Lamb noted that the song [...] "didn't have the same {{intensity}} of emotional impact" [...] other Alex da Kid productions (Eminem's [...] "Love the Way You Lie") but it did [...] "deliver a warmth and sense of hope <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match with the current holiday season."

Dexter {{is one of those}} shows. [...] " [...] and summarized with [...] "The pilot episode did an extremely good job hooking us into the world of Dexter. We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning."

40|$|Are there good {{grounds for}} {{thinking}} that the moral values of action are {{to be derived from}} those of character? This ‘virtue ethical’ claim is sometimes thought of as a kind of normative ethical theory; sometimes as form of opposition to any such theory. However, the best case to be made for it supports neither of these claims. Rather, it leads us to a distinctive view in moral epistemology: the view that my warrant for a particular moral judgement derives from my warrant for believing <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moral judge. This view seems to confront a regress-problem. For the belief <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moral judge <b>is</b> itself <b>a</b> particular moral judgement. So it seems that, on this view, I need to derive my warrant for believing <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moral judge from my warrant for believing <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> judge of moral judges; and so on. I show how this worry can be met, and trace the implications of the resulting view for warranted moral judgement. Garrett Cullit...|$|R

2500|$|Our government, {{under our}} Constitution, was {{established}} upon {{the principles of}} Federalism -- {{that the federal government}} would have limited enumerated powers and the rest would be left to the states. It not only prevented tyranny, it just made good sense. States become laboratories for democracy and experiment with different kinds of laws. One state might try one welfare reform approach, for example. Another state might try another approach. One would work and the other would not. The federal welfare reform law resulted from just this process. [...] Federalism also allows for the diversity that exists among the country's people. Citizens of our various states have different views as to how traditional state responsibilities should be handled. This way, states compete with each other to attract people and businesses -- and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing.|$|E
2500|$|North America, and {{the band}} {{said they did not}} want to change their type of music for the American public.

2500|$|Cromwell had two key {{objectives}} as Lord Protector. The first was [...] "healing and settling" [...] the nation after {{the chaos of}} the civil wars and the regicide, which meant establishing a stable form for the new government to take. Although Cromwell declared to the first Protectorate Parliament that, [...] "Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental," [...] in practice social priorities took precedence over forms of government. Such forms were, he said, [...] "but... dross and dung in comparison of Christ". The social priorities did not, despite the revolutionary nature of the government, include any meaningful attempt to reform the social order. Cromwell declared, [...] "A nobleman, a gentleman, a yeoman; the distinction of these: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> interest of the nation, and a great one!", Small-scale reform such as that carried out on the judicial system were outweighed by attempts to restore order to English politics. Direct taxation was reduced slightly and peace was made with the Dutch, ending the First Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E

2500|$|According to a {{compilation}} by Deb Aoki of About.com, Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths {{was considered the}} best new manga of 2011 because it was included in 18 critics lists of best comics/graphic novels. Aoki said the manga is [...] "dense with details, and filled with pathos, humor and horror". Pastes Garrett Martin wrote that the [...] "realistic depictions of normal men trapped in a horrible situation" [...] makes Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths [...] "brutally honest". Brigid Alverson of MTV Geek said, [...] "this {{is not an easy}} story to read, but its historical importance and the lessons it holds for the future are undeniable". Noel Murray writing in The A.V. Club said the manga's artwork is [...] "detailed, often beautiful illustrations of small Pacific islands with characters rendered far less elaborately". Karen Green of Comixology wrote that the [...] "story is so human and its message so powerful" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> book to eliminate the preconceptions American may have of the Japanese Army that are frequently propagated by Hollywood. Among others, Library Journal, Dan Kois and Glen Weldon of NPR, Comic Book Resources, Ed Sizemore of Manga Worth Reading, and Publishers Weekly included it on their lists of best comic books of 2011.
