40|$|SummaryBackgroundDuring active (or REM) sleep, infant mammals exhibit myoclonic <b>twitches</b> of {{skeletal}} muscles {{throughout the}} body, generating jerky, discrete {{movements of the}} distal limbs. Hundreds of thousands of limb <b>twitches</b> are produced daily, and sensory feedback from these movements is a substantial driver of infant brain activity, suggesting that they contribute to motor learning and sensorimotor integration. It is not known whether the production of <b>twitches</b> is random or spatiotemporally structured, or whether the patterning of <b>twitching</b> changes with age; such information is critical for understanding how <b>twitches</b> contribute to development. ResultsWe used high-speed videography and 3 D motion tracking to assess the spatiotemporal structure of <b>twitching</b> at forelimb joints in 2 - and 8 -day-old rats. At both ages, <b>twitches</b> exhibited highly structured spatiotemporal properties at multiple timescales, including synergistic and multijoint movements within and across forelimbs. Hierarchical cluster analysis and latent class analysis revealed developmental changes in <b>twitching</b> quantity and patterning. Critically, we found evidence for a selectionist process whereby movement patterns at the early age compete for retention and expression over development. ConclusionsThese findings indicate that <b>twitches</b> are not produced randomly but are highly structured at multiple timescales. This structure {{has important implications for}} understanding brain and spinal mechanisms that produce <b>twitching,</b> and the role that sensory feedback from <b>twitching</b> plays in sensorimotor system development. We propose that <b>twitches</b> represent a heretofore-overlooked form of motor exploration that helps animals probe the biomechanics of their limbs, build motor synergies, and lay a foundation for complex, automatic, and goal-directed wake movements...|$|R
40|$|<b>Twitching</b> {{motility}} is {{an important}} migration mechanism for the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the commonly used subsurface <b>twitching</b> assay, the sub-population of P. aeruginosa with active <b>twitching</b> motility is difficult to harvest for high-throughput studies. Here we describe {{the development of a}} novel method that allows efficient isolation of bacterial sub-populations conducting highly active <b>twitching</b> motility. The transcription factor AmrZ regulates multiple P. aeruginosa virulence factors including <b>twitching</b> motility, yet the mechanism of this activation remains unclear. We therefore set out to understand this mechanism by defining the AmrZ regulon using DNA microarrays in combination with the newly developed <b>twitching</b> motility method. We discovered 112 genes in the AmrZ regulon and many encode virulence factors. One gene of interest and the subsequent focus was lecB, which encodes a fucose-binding lectin. DNA binding assays revealed that AmrZ activates lecB transcription by directly binding to its promoter. The lecB gene was previously shown to be required for <b>twitching</b> motility in P. aeruginosa strain PAK; however, our lecB deletion had no effect on <b>twitching</b> motility in strain PAO 1. Collectively, in this study a novel condition was developed for quantitative studies of <b>twitching</b> motility, under which the AmrZ regulon was defined...|$|R
40|$|The {{involvement}} of presynaptic serotonergic {{activity in the}} fenfluramine-induced head <b>twitches</b> was investigated using various drugs in 2 -month-and 10 -month-old mice. Mice administerd fenfluramine produced head <b>twitches</b> which were inhibited by methysergide and cyproheptadine, serotonergic antagonist. The freqency of head <b>twitches</b> induced by fenfluramine and 5 -methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeODMT) was higher in 10 -month-old mice than in 2 -month-old mice. Pretreatments with p-chlorophnylalanine (PCPA), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, and reserpine an amine depletor, significantly potentiated 5 -MeODMT-induced head <b>twitches</b> in 2 -month-old mice, but did not affect those in 10 -month-old mice. Pretreatment with PCPA inhibited fenfluramine : induced head <b>twitches</b> in either 2 -month-or 10 -monthe-old mice, whereas pretreatment with reserpine inhibited the head <b>twitches</b> in 10 -month-old mice but did not change the head <b>twitches</b> in 2 -month-old mice. These results suggest that fenfluramine-induced head <b>twitches</b> may be mediated by endogenous serotonin which is released from presynapse of central serotonergic neuron. The decreased function of presynaptic receptormay potentiate the postsynaptic receptor activities, {{and contribute to the}} increase head <b>twitches</b> induced by fenfluramine and 5 -MeODMT, with increasing age in the mouse...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{release of}} {{neurotransmitter}} {{has been demonstrated}} in various types of synapses. Its physiological significance, however, is still unknown. In nerve-muscle cultures of embryonic Xenopus laevis, we observed that acetylcholine, which is released spontaneously at the synaptic terminal, caused frequent <b>twitches</b> of muscle cells. These muscle cells developed cross-striations earlier than neighboring non-twitching cells. This effect of innervation was unaffected by tetrodotoxin but was blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Repeated iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or KCl to muscle cells caused <b>twitches</b> and also accelerated the formation of cross-striations. Thus <b>twitching</b> apparently promotes lateral alignment of myofibrils. It is also known that myosin synthesis is higher in <b>twitching</b> muscle cells. Therefore, successfully innervated <b>twitching</b> muscle cells may have an advantage for faster differentiation over neighboring non-twitching muscle cells. We suggest that spontaneously released transmitter {{may serve as a}} mediator for trophic interaction at forming synapses...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{examination}} of type IV pilus genes associated with competence and <b>twitching</b> in the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi (strain ADP 1, BD 413). We used bioinformatics to identify potential competence and <b>twitching</b> genes and their operons. We measured the competence and <b>twitching</b> phenotypes of the bioinformatically-identified genes. These results demonstrate that competence and <b>twitching</b> in A. baylyi both rely upon a core of the same type IV pilus proteins. The core includes the inner membrane assembly platform (PilC), a periplasmic assemblage connecting the inner membrane assembly platform to the secretin (ComM), a secretin (ComQ) and its associated pilotin (PilF) that assists with secretin assembly and localization, both cytoplasmic pilus retraction ATPases (PilU, PilT), and pilins (ComP, ComB, PilX). Proteins not needed for both competence and <b>twitching</b> are instead found to specialize in {{either of the two}} traits. The pilins are varied in their specialization with some required for either competence (FimT) and others for <b>twitching</b> (ComE). The protein that transports DNA across the inner membrane (ComA) specializes in competence, while signal transduction proteins (PilG, PilS, and PilR) specialize in <b>twitching.</b> Taken together our results suggest that the function of accessory proteins should not be based on homology alone. In addition the results suggest that in A. baylyi the mechanisms of natural transformation and <b>twitching</b> are mediated by the same set of core Type IV pilus proteins with distinct specialized proteins required for each phenotype. Finally, since competence requires multiple pilins as well as both pilus retraction motors PilU and PilT, this suggests that A. baylyi employs a pilus in natural transformation...|$|R
40|$|Thalamic neurons {{have two}} firing modes: tonic and bursting. It was {{originally}} suggested that bursting occurs only during {{states such as}} slow-wave sleep, when little or no information is relayed by the thalamus. However, bursting occurs during wakefulness in the visual and somatosensory thalamus, and could theoretically influence sensory processing. Here we used chronically implanted electrodes to record from the ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus (VPM) and primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of awake, freely moving rats during different behaviors. These behaviors included quiet immobility, exploratory whisking (large-amplitude whisker movements), and whisker <b>twitching</b> (small-amplitude, 7 - to 12 -Hz whisker movements). We demonstrated that thalamic bursting appeared during the oscillatory activity occurring before whisker <b>twitching</b> movements, and continued throughout the whisker <b>twitching.</b> Further, thalamic bursting occurred during whisker <b>twitching</b> substantially more often than during the other behaviors, and a neuron was most likely {{to respond to a}} stimulus if a burst occurred ≈ 120 ms before the stimulation. In addition, the amount of cortical area activated was similar to that during whisking. However, when SI was inactivated by muscimol infusion, whisker <b>twitching</b> was never observed. Finally, we used a statistical technique called partial directed coherence to identify the direction of influence of neural activity between VPM and SI, and observed that there was more directional coherence from SI to VPM during whisker <b>twitching</b> than during the other behaviors. Based on these findings, we propose that during whisker <b>twitching,</b> a descending signal from SI triggers thalamic bursting that primes the thalamocortical loop for enhanced signal detection during the whisker <b>twitching</b> behavior...|$|R
