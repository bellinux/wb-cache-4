5|$|At {{the border}} with Deptford Township, Route 47 reaches an {{intersection}} known as Five Points. Here, the road meets Route 41, County Route 603, and County Route 630. Route 47 turns northwest as this intersection and runs through wooded areas with some dwellings, with Route 55 intersecting the route at a cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. Past this interchange, the road continues through wooded inhabited areas, eventually turning due north. It comes to an intersection with the western terminus of County Route 534 as the route heads <b>through</b> <b>more</b> suburban homes along with businesses. Past this intersection, Route 47 passes businesses before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From here, it heads <b>through</b> <b>more</b> inhabited areas before entering Westville. Upon entering Westville, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. Past this interchange, the road runs through neighborhoods, intersecting County Route 621 (Almonesson Road) and County Route 551. The latter forms a concurrency with Route 47 and these two routes run northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County. Here, {{it comes to a}} traffic circle with U.S. Route 130 and County Route 753, where Route 47 ends and County Route 551 continues on to Camden, forming a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 130.|$|E

The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|Continuing into Manalapan Township, {{the route}} runs <b>through</b> <b>more</b> {{suburban}} areas and passes {{to the east}} of the former Manalapan Mall, which is now a big–box complex.
