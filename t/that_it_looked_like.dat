5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the garrison would be wiped out {{in a matter of}} months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the game}} was {{designed}} with an overseas release in mind. Among the early ideas created for the title was {{for it to be}} set in New York City, inspired by John Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York. This was vetoed as it would not offer much variety in its cast. To enable an international cast, it was decided to set the game in Antarctica. This choice of setting was also made to depict the danger posed by the Schwarzwelt on a worldwide scale. This setting differed greatly from previous Shin Megami Tensei games, which had taken place in Tokyo. It was also chosen as the North Pole had no widespread landmass, making it an impractical setting. When developing the character drama, the team took inspiration from another film by Carpenter, 1982's The Thing. The moral alignment system, a staple in earlier Shin Megami Tensei entries, was reintroduced for Strange Journey to help players experience the game's themes. The central cast acted as both a microcosm of humanity and representation of the game's alignments. Due to the setting, the characters had to be members of a Special Forces group, as opposed to previous protagonists who had been average people. The game includes a larger presence of science fiction elements than in previous Shin Megami Tensei games. Various elements within the game were inspired by science fiction movies: the Red Sprite was inspired by the main vehicle from the 1977 film Damnation Alley, and some equipment was inspired by James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens. The characters' firearms were all modeled after real-life guns. Elaborating on how the science fiction elements complemented rather than clashed with the mystical elements of Shin Megami Tensei, Kaneko stated that he felt that the series had always had elements of those two genres merging, commenting that some people saw a web URL as something like a magical incantation and referencing a quote from Arthur C. Clark about technology becoming so advanced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> magic.|$|E

25|$|Hosokawa {{was forced}} to resign in April 1994 after it came to light that he had {{accepted}} a 100-million-yen loan from a trucking company previously accused of bribery and links to organized crime. Amid allegations of bribery, Hosokawa argued that the money was a loan and produced a receipt to show that he had paid it back; LDP members passed around a copy remarking <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a sloppy fake. Although Hosokawa still had high public approval at the time, opinion was growing that he could not meet the expectations set at the start of his term.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{familial}} DNA database searches {{argue that}} the technique is an invasion of an individual's 4th Amendment rights. Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees {{would be to have}} a population-wide DNA database. Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques, and most have concluded that the practice is constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Pool (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator. Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect's DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.|$|E

25|$|Silver King joined World Championship Wrestling in 1997 {{as one of}} {{the many}} Luchadors that worked for the company in that time period. He mostly found himself usually working six man matches on WCW Monday Nitro, teaming with Psicosis and La Parka or Villano IV and Villano V. During his time in WCW Silver King only made 5 {{pay-per-view}} appearances. Twice he participated in a Three Ring, 60 man battle royal at World War 3 1997 and World War 3 1998. He also participated in a Junkyard Invitational at Bash at the Beach 1999 but with no success. His highest profile match was an unsuccessful challenge for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Juventud Guerrera at Fall Brawl 1998. When Eddie Guerrero formed the Latino World Order Silver King w{{as one of the}} Luchadors that joined the group but never rose above his lower mid-card status. It was not until 2000 when Stacy Keibler announced that she started managing the team of Silver King and El Dandy, known as Los Fabulosos, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> Silver King was going to move up the rankings. Silver King was released from WCW in late 2000.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 17 May 2004 and lasted six weeks. Arctor's house was located on Eric Circle in Southeast Austin. The previous tenants {{had left a}} month prior to filming and left the place {{in such a state}} that production designer Bruce Curtis had to make few modifications so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a run-down home. The filmmakers had looked at 60 houses before settling on this one. Linklater shot a lot of exteriors in Anaheim, California and then composited them into the Austin footage in post-production. Since the live action footage was to be animated over later, makeup, lighting and visible equipment, like boom mics, were less of a concern. However, cinematographer Shane Kelly carefully composed shots and used a color palette with the animators in mind. Sometimes, they would show up to tell Kelly what they needed. Because the movie was being shot digitally and then animated, occasionally actors forgot they would later be animated as they worked through a scene. Robert Downey, Jr. noted that he completely forgot the scene would later be animated as he worked through several takes in order to produce the smoke ring that would be featured in Barris' first closeup shot.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at WrestleMania 32, a {{match between}} Big Show and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal had been teased from various media outlets, {{including}} WWE. Shaq {{was a surprise}} entrant in the 2016 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where he and Big Show faced off, but the other participants eliminated both of them. In July at the 2016 ESPY Awards on the red carpet, Show and Shaq had another brief confrontation. A match was proposed for WrestleMania 33, which Shaq accepted. In January 2017, the two began calling each other out on social media, posting workout videos of themselves preparing for the potential match. Big Show then began to doubt Shaq's commitment to the match. By the end of February, Shaq said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the match {{was not going to}} happen, but he would still train just in case. The following week, Shaq said that discussions were back on between him and WWE. However, Big Show's announcement as a participant in the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal indicated that the match was off. According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal. Big Show said that he really wanted to do the match, especially since this would probably be his last WrestleMania and blamed Shaq's weight as a reason for why Shaq backed out.|$|E

500|$|Following {{its release}} with the Code seal of approval, {{the film was}} {{challenged}} by the censorship board {{in the state of}} Ohio. Censors in England and China objected to the scene in which the Monster gazes longingly upon the as-yet unanimated body of the Bride, citing concerns <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> necrophilia. Universal voluntarily [...] withdrew the film from Sweden because of the extensive cuts demanded, and Bride was rejected outright by Trinidad, Palestine, and Hungary. One unusual objection, from Japanese censors, was that the scene in which Pretorius chases his miniature Henry VIII with tweezers constituted [...] "making a fool out of a king".|$|E

500|$|Godesburg, a {{fortress}} {{a few kilometers}} from the Elector's capital city of Bonn, was taken by storm in late 1583after a brutal month-long siege; when Bavarian cannonades failed to break the bastions, sappers tunneled under the thick walls and blew up the fortifications from below. The Catholic Archbishop's forces still could not break through {{the remains of the}} fortifications, so they crawled through the garderobe sluices (hence the name, Sewer War). Upon taking the fortress, they killed every defender except three, a Captain of the Guard who could prove he was a citizen of Cologne, and the son of an important Cologne politician, the commander and his wife. The [...] of road between Godesberg and Bonn was filled with so many troops <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a military camp.

500|$|After dating {{for several}} months, Love and Cobain were married on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 24, 1992. Love wore a satin and lace dress {{once owned by}} actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas. Six months later, on August 18, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born. In April 1994, Cobain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles. During their marriage, and after Cobain's death, Love became {{something}} of a hate-figure among some of Cobain's fans. In reflecting on their relationship, Love said: [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> it was headed for doom, but it didn't feel like it was headed for doom on a daily basis. We went mountain biking; we would go camping. We were damn normal." [...] After his cremation, Love divided portions of Cobain's ashes; she kept some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. Another portion of his ashes was taken by Love to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York in 1994, where they were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.|$|E
