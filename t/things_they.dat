5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with systems named after places, saints or <b>things</b> <b>they</b> hit before the formal start of naming in the Western Pacific. These included the Kamikaze, 1906 Hong Kong typhoon, 1922 Swatow typhoon and the 1934 Muroto typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrims were Brownist English Dissenters; {{they sought}} {{a version of}} the Christian {{religion}} without <b>things</b> <b>they</b> deemed nonessential, such as bishops or Christmas. They differed from the Puritans; the Pilgrims were stricter, and instead of seeking to reform the Church of England from within, sought to separate themselves from it. They had left England for the Netherlands because in 1608, King James I began to persecute Separatists. Among those who fled then was William Bradford.|$|E
5|$|The rules {{had a major}} {{influence}} on how the modern game of football developed. Among other <b>things</b> <b>they</b> introduced into the laws of the game the concepts of corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls. The abolition of the fair catch also led to their teams {{to be the first to}} head the ball. Games played under the rules are also credited with the development of heading and the origins of the goalkeeper and forward positions. The first inter-club football match and competitive tournament were both played using Sheffield Rules.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird <b>things</b> <b>they</b> do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for <b>things</b> <b>they</b> did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
5|$|People {{have been}} living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were {{originally}} hunter-gatherers. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth. Other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them their tents made of cloth or skins draped over poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.|$|E

5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a conversation about <b>things</b> <b>they</b> had done while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{coverage}} is erratic, {{a direct result}} of the sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley's 1786 Observations on Livestock and the antique John Caius's 1576 On English Dogs. Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside <b>things</b> <b>they</b> knew.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years, with systems named after places or <b>things</b> <b>they</b> hit before the formal start of naming. The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems {{in a brief}} form, that is readily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different <b>things.</b> <b>They</b> all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities of the people he met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of <b>things</b> <b>they</b> can accomplish in a day.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad <b>things</b> <b>they</b> said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with storms named after places, saints or <b>things</b> <b>they</b> hit before the formal start of naming in each basin. Examples of such names are the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane and the 1938 New England hurricane. The system currently in place provides identification of tropical cyclones {{in a brief}} form that is easily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems {{is given to the}} Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part of}} World War II for the Western Pacific. Over the following decades formal naming schemes were introduced for several tropical cyclone basins, including the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try <b>things</b> <b>they</b> had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Greeks of Thessalonica sent an embassy to the Great Council to {{complain}} of violations {{of their rights}} by the duke and captain. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> insisted that the Venetians fortify Kassandreia on the western Chalcidice, to protect the Kassandra Peninsula from Ottoman raids. In response, Michiel occupied the fort of Kassandreia, which he refortified and strengthened by the construction of two smaller forts in the area. He also captured the Platamon Castle, {{on the opposite side}} of the Thermaic Gulf, by storm, after setting fire to its main bailey as the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. Platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after, for it is not mentioned again. Following Michiel's request, the Great Council sent 200 men from Padua to man Thessalonica and the forts of Kassandreia, and authorised the captain-general to maintain four galleys in the area. From his letters to the Great Council, Michiel was also engaged in negotiations with the Ottomans, as part of which he offered 20,000 aspers a year to the Ottoman governor of Thessaly, Turahan Bey, and to the Grand Vizier. At the same time, according to the Codex Morosini, a pretender claiming to be Mustafa Çelebi arrived in Thessalonica, and gathered a growing following of Turks who considered him to be the true son of Sultan Bayezid. Pseudo-Mustafa launched raids against Murad's forces from the city, but after both Mustafa and the Venetian captain were almost captured during one of these raids, on 3 September the Great Council issued instructions to stop such raids, and keep the gates of the city shut.|$|E
