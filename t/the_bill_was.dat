5|$|After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 {{had gone}} some way toward {{procedural}} reform, in February 1867, Roundell Palmer again brought {{the problem of}} having two separate court systems to Parliament's attention, and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single, unified High Court of Justice. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> a weak one, not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with equity, and was also silent {{on the structure of}} the court, as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure, not substance. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> heavily opposed from two sides: those who opposed fusion, and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> eventually withdrawn.|$|E

May immediately had the bill referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee.

5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> {{part of a}} large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>was</b> finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E

5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms.

50|$|In the British/Westminster system, a <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> read <b>the</b> {{first time}} when it is introduced.

After the second reading <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>is</b> referred to a committee, which considers <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> line by line proposing amendments. The committee reports to the legislature, at which stage further amendments are proposed. Finally a third reading debate at which <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> as amended <b>is</b> considered in its entirety.

5|$|In {{the final}} {{hours of the}} {{legislative}} session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice of stopping the clocks in their respective chambers {{a few minutes before}} midnight {{in order to avoid the}} constitutionally mandated deadline for the end of the session – midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and direction for the state's road-building plan for the next six years. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he vetoed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>was</b> actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin with. On July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice of stopping the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.|$|E
