40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{multidisciplinary}} optimization of a generic two dimensional three element high-lift configuration. The objective of this work is to conduct a proof-of concept optimization and to find an optimized high-lift system with a feasible flap mechanism and enhanced aerodynamic performance which is reflected in a decreased <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>distance.</b> During the multidisciplinary optimization following disciplines are analyzed: Kinematics, Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics. The proof-of-concept optimization is performed successfully and reveals a configuration with improved aerodynamic performance, reduced <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>distance</b> while the kinematic and aerodynamic constraints are satisfied. The overall <b>take-off</b> <b>distance</b> is reduced due to the augmentation of the maximum lift coefficient for the take-off configuration {{which leads to a}} significant shorter ground roll distance. At landing the moderate reduction in the overall landing distance is related to the enhanced maximum lift coefficient, which lowers the approach and touch-down speed. According to the data sets of the optimization it seems that the <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>distance</b> that form the objective function are not in conflict in this scenario. The optimization results indicate that the aerodynamic performance is more sensitive to parameters that define the slat setting and the magnitude of the flap deployment than to parameters that define the geometry of the flap mechanism...|$|R
