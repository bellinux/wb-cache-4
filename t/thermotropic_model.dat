40|$|Building {{a general}} {{theoretical}} framework {{to describe the}} microscopic origin of macroscopic chirality in (colloidal) liquid crystals is a long-standing challenge. Here, we combine classical density functional theory with Monte Carlo calculations of virial-type coefficients to obtain the equilibrium cholesteric pitch {{as a function of}} thermodynamic state and microscopic details. Applying the theory to hard helices, we observe both right-and left-handed cholesteric phases that depend on a subtle combination of particle geometry and system density. In particular, we find that entropy alone can even lead to a (double) inversion in the cholesteric sense of twist upon changing the packing fraction. We show how the competition between single-particle properties (shape) and thermodynamics (local alignment) dictates the macroscopic chiral behavior. Moreover, by expanding our free-energy functional, we are able to assess, quantitatively, Straley's theory of weak chirality, which is used in several earlier studies. Furthermore, by extending our theory to different lyotropic and <b>thermotropic</b> liquid-crystal <b>models,</b> we analyze the effect of an additional soft interaction on the chiral behavior of the helices. Finally, we provide some guidelines for the description of more complex chiral phases, like twist-bend nematics.

The measure of the experimentally observable optical Kerr effect signal is found to follow a power law decay at short-to-intermediate times for both systems in agreement with recent experiments. In addition, the temperature dependence of the power law exponent is found to be rather weak.

40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} the relationship between the relative cytotoxicity of diluted ionic liquids and their specific interaction with biological membranes, the <b>thermotropic</b> behavior of <b>model</b> lipid membrane systems formulated in a series of choline based organic salts was investigated. Unilamellar vesicles prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine were exposed to a series of choline phosphate salts at a concentration of 10 mM at pH 7. 40, and the gel to liquid-crystalline state transition was examined using differential scanning calorimetry. The choline salts that were observed to have a low relative toxicity in previous studies induced minimal changes in the lipid phase transition behavior of these model membranes. In contrast, the salts choline bis(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinate and choline bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate, both of which were observed to have high relative toxicity, caused distinct disruptions in the lipid phase transition behavior, consistent with penetration of the salts into the acyl chains of the phospholipids. choline bis(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinate reduced the Tm and enthalpy of the main transition of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine while choline bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate induced the equilibration of alternate phases...|$|R

Reversible self-assemblies of nucleic acids with proteins that have defined internal structure in solution, i. e. viruses, represent some of the best elucidated biological supramolecules. This thesis represents our latest efforts to synthesize structural, functional and systemic mimics of such natural complexes, using a strategy based on the molecular design, synthesis and characterization of non-biological dendritic supramolecular self-assemblies that resemble in a primitive way the assembly of cylindrical or icosahedral viruses. ^ Our investigation employed building blocks able to self-assemble into cylindrical or spherical supramolecules that afforded hexagonal columnar or cubic <b>thermotropic</b> lattices. <b>Model</b> dendrons, i. e. minidendrons, were used as maquettes for the elaboration of high generation dendrimers and we demonstrated their potential in determining: (a) critical structural parameters for the self-assembly, (b) thermally-induced shape change mechanism, (c) novel architectural motifs. In addition, covalent linkage of these maquettes via a poly(ethyleneimine) backbone allowed: (a) the elucidation of the shape change mechanism {{as a function of the}} degree of polymerization, (b) the demonstration of the structural quasi-equivalence of these dendrons in the self-assembled state and (c) visualization of the self-assemblies on surfaces. These findings afforded the possibility of the estimation of the structure-properties relationship in self-assemblies formed from larger generations of dendritic structures. ^ Subsequent investigations involved the living ring opening metathesis polymerization of 7 -oxanorbornene monomers bearing bulky dendritic substituents. The shape of the resulted self-assembly was monitored and the shape change event during the polymerization of suitable monomers was elucidated by employing kinetic methods. Under certain conditions, extremely bulky and rigid substituents prevent the propagation past a critical degree of polymerization and the active chain end is encapsulated by the supramolecular aggregate. This results in a non-statistical interruption and the contained polymer chain is monodisperse. This synthetic system presents a sum of characteristics encountered before only in nature, i. e. molecular recognition directed synthesis, programmed control over the molecular weights, encoding of the final shape and size in the parental structure, and functionality preservation. ...|$|R

Compared to AZT, compound 4 possessed ca. 10 -fold lower anti-HIV activity and ca. 10 -fold higher anti-tumor cell activity. Compound 5 was 10 -fold less potent than compound 4 in both biological tests. In an attempt to correlate biological activity of compounds 4 and 5 with structure, their conformational and thermal effects on membrane bilayers were compared {{using a combination of}} NMR spectroscopy, computational analysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The obtained results showed that compound 4 adopts a compact conformation in which the alkyl chain, the 2 -methoxyglyceryl functionality, and the methyl group of thymine are in spatial proximity, while analogue 5 possesses a less compact conformation of the nucleoside base and the alkyl chain. The presence of the 2 -methoxyglyceryl group in compound 4 may augment its potency by inducing a turn of the alkyl chain stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The DSC scans show that conjugate 4 affects less effectively the <b>thermotropic</b> properties of <b>model</b> membrane bilayers than compound 5. This may be attributed to the fact that compound 4 is incorporated in a compact conformation and does not perturb significantly the trans:gauche isomerization of the membrane phospholipids.

Introduction Biaxial nematic phases have been a subject of great interest {{for some time and}} this interest is increasing as the chase for undisputed thermotropic biaxial nematics continues [1]. Part of this focused attention comes from the possibility of technological applications in the fast display area [2], but much of the fascination of the subject certainly originates from the basic research arena and from the hiatus between theoretical [3] and experimental predictions [4, 5]. Biaxial nematics are not theoretically forbidden and indeed have been predicted to exist, and thus to be the most stable phase in a certain range of thermodynamic conditions, by various approximate theories, mainly on the basis of considerations of orientational order and of orientational free energy[3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Monte Carlo simulations of systems of interacting biaxial centers placed on a lattice [11, 12] have essentially confirmed these predictions and the phase diagram obtained [12] has shown a biaxial region where the biaxial phase is stable compared to both the uniaxial nematic and isotropic ones. However, as we have already mentioned, none of the low molecular mass thermotropic biaxial nematics put forward [13] appears to have been universally accepted as such. Indeed various of the compounds classified as biaxial nematics {{on the basis of their}} optical behavior have shown no detectable biaxiality when examined with deuterium NMR [4, 5].

The effect of α-tocopherol on 1, 2 -distearoylglycerophosphocholine (18 : 0, 18 : 0), 1 -stearoyl- 2 -oleoylglycerophosphocholine (18 : 0, 18 : 1), 1 -stearoyl- 2 -linoleoylglycerophosphocholine (18 : 0, 18 : 2), 1 -stearoyl- 2 -linolenoylglycerophosphocholine (18 : 0, 18 : 3) and 1 -stearoyl- 2 -arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine (18 : 0, 20 : 4) was determined. The addition of α-tocopherol perturbed the thermotropic gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition of these phospholipids. α-Tocopherol broadened the endotherm, lowered the transition temperature and decreased the associated enthalpy change. Partial phase diagrams showed the presence of fluid immiscibilities giving rise to lateral phase separation of domains containing different amounts of α-tocopherol. We suggest that, in these α-tocopherol-rich domains, the influence exerted by the vitamin on the phospholipids is strong enough to alter their thermotropic properties such that an additional endotherm appears in the thermogram, a characteristic not observed in homoacid phosphatidylcholines. α-Tocopherol caused a concentration-dependent removal of the detectable phase transition in all cases. The magnitude of the influence of α-tocopherol on phospholipid was dependent on the degree of unsaturation of the sn- 2 acyl chain. These results are explained {{on the basis of the}} effect of α-tocopherol which will reduce the differences between gel and liquid crystalline states, the magnitude of these differences depending on the type of phospholipid considered, which are probably related to the change of molecular shape of phosphatidylcholines containing a polyunsaturated acyl chain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThermotropic {{materials}} {{offer the}} potential to provide overheat protection for polymer absorbers. These materials are composed of a matrix material in which a second material, {{referred to as the}} scattering domain, is dispersed. Temperature control is accomplished by a reduction in transmittance at a desired temperature corresponding to the phase change temperature of the scattering domain. The phase change is accompanied by a change in refractive index. This paper describes a numerical model to predict the transmittance and reflectance of a polymer based thermotropic material {{as a function of the}} relative index of refraction m between the matrix and scattering domains, the scattering domain size and volume fraction fv, and the sheet thickness. The <b>thermotropic</b> material is <b>modelled</b> as a non-absorbing sheet comprised of discrete anisotropic scattering spherical particles embedded in a matrix material. Under the assumption that the particles scatter incident radiation independently, the direction of scattered radiation is determined by Mie theory. A Monte Carlo numerical technique is used to predict the transmittance and reflectance for thermotropic materials in which the matrix index of refraction is 1. 5 (representative of polymers) and the incident wavelength is 550 nm. Model results are validated by comparison to measured transmittance for 0. 3 mm thick polymer samples containing particles with 200 nm radius at m ranging from 0. 97 to 1. 09 and fv ranging from 5 to 18. 2 %. As the mismatch in refractive indices and volume fraction increase, the transmittance is reduced. For example, the transmittance is reduced from 83 % for m= 1. 02 and fv = 9. 6 to approximately 50 % for m= 1. 09 and fv = 13. 5 % (200 nm radius and 0. 3 mm thick) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} {{in detail the}} effects of the {{anesthetic}} steroid alphaxalone and its inactive analog Δ 16 -alphaxalone on the <b>thermotropic</b> properties of <b>model</b> membranes using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results obtained showed that, for model membranes from hydrated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and egg sphingomyelin, the biologically active analog significantly broadened the phase transition, in contrast to the inactive one which produced only marginal effects. Also, alphaxalone abolished the pretransition in these preparations whereas its Δ 16 -analog only broadened it. However, in DPPE bilayers almost no differences were observed in the effects produced by the two analogs. These results suggest that the ability of the two steroids to perturb membranes is lipid dependent. Comparisons between {{the effects of the}} two steroids on lipid/cholesterol model membranes revealed that Δ 16 -alphaxalone excluded cholesterol from lipid/cholesterol/Δ 16 -alphaxalone ternary systems whereas alphaxalone enhanced the effects of cholesterol and reduced the cooperativity in the binary phospholipid/cholesterol system. In an attempt to determine whether the different thermotropic effects of the two steroids on model membranes were due to (a) differences in their ability to perturb the bilayers; (b) different extents of incorporation into the bilayer, solid state 2 H-NMR was applied using specifically deuterated steroids. The 2 H-NMR data showed that alphaxalone incorporated fully into the membrane bilayer up to a molar concentration of 20 %, while its inactive analog did only up to a concentration of 1 %. To compare the abilities of the two steroids to perturb membrane preparations when both analogs were present in equal amounts in the membrane, the effects of very low steroid concentrations on DPPC bilayers were studied using DSC. The experiment showed that alphaxalone perturbed the membrane bilayers more effectively than its inactive analog. These results strongly suggest that the small structural differences between the two steroids are responsible for the observed differences in their abilities to perturb membranes, possibly because of differences in the packing of these two molecules within the bilayers...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Susan Mantell, Jane Davidson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvi, 179 pages. A series of numerical studies of thermotropic materials are conducted {{to develop a}} theoretical basis for the selection and design of phase change thermotropic materials for polymer collectors. The optical requirements for a thermotropic material to provide overheat protection are identified. In the clear state, high solar-weighted transmittance (&# 8805; 80 %, preferably &# 8805; 85 %). To protect an absorber of polypropylene, material temperature limit of 115 �C, the solar-weighted reflectance of the thermotropic material must be &# 8805; 50 %. To determine how to achieve these optical requirements, the radiative transfer within <b>thermotropic</b> materials is <b>modeled</b> with a Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithm. A parametric study of the radiative transfer in thermotropic materials is conducted. The results are presented as dimensionless plots of transmittance and reflectance {{as a function of}} the overall optical thickness &# 964;L, the scattering albedo &# 969;, and the particle size parameter x. The study demonstrates that to achieve &# 8805; 85 % transmittance in the clear state, the optical thickness must be low. To achieve &# 8805; 50 % reflectance in the translucent state necessitates a significant increase in optical thickness with temperature. Additionally, the material must have small particles (x &# 8804; 2. 5) and be weakly absorbing (&# 969; &# 8805; 0. 990). For example, for a size parameter of 2, the optical thickness in the clear state must be &# 8804; 0. 35. The optical thickness in the translucent state must be &# 8805; 10 for a scattering albedo of 0. 995. The data contained in these dimensionless plots can be used to identify and optimize thermotropic materials. A method for indentifying potential thermotropic material combinations is presented. Using encapsulated particles in a thermotropic material is also investigated. The transmittance and reflectance of hydroxystearic acid in poly(methyl methacrylate) are predicted as a function of shell refractive index, shell thickness, and particle volume fraction. The study demonstrates that a thermotropic material with encapsulated particles can achieve the optical requirements for use in a solar collector. Additionally, the study reveals that a wide range of shell relative refractive indices, from 0. 95 to 1. 0, and thicknesses, up to 35 nm, provide acceptable optical performance...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Although liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) emerged as important engineering {{materials in the}} early 1970 s, {{the current level of}} understanding still falls short of allowing deliberate manipulation of macroscopic orientation, leading to poor control of morphology and material properties. The flow behavior of rod-like LCP solutions (lyotropic) are fairly well understood, yet little progress has been made on LCP melts (thermotropic) because of the formidable experimental difficulties with commercial thermotropes. A simple extension of the knowledge obtained from rod-like LCP solutions to thermotropic LCPs is unlikely to hold due to the enhanced molecular flexibility and intimate molecular contact in LCP melts. The primary concern of this thesis is therefore the flow behavior of thermotropic LCPs, with an emphasis on how flow influences orientation and morphology and how this depends on molecular structure. For this purpose we synthesized a <b>model</b> <b>thermotropic</b> LCP selected for its chemical stability, wide nematic range and optical transparency. This main-chain LCP, designated as DHMS- 7, 9, has alternating mesogen and spacer structure with dihydroxy-[alpha]-methylstilbene as mesogen and two different lengths of alkyl spacers ([ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]). A range of molecular weights were prepared to probe the effects of chain flexibility (ratio of chain length of persistence length). Synthesis was scaled up to provide adequate quantities for physical studies (rheology, rheo-conoscopy and rheo-WAXS). The director response of a monodomain during shear flow is followed by in situ optical conoscopy using a custom-made shear cell. We observe that the director rotates opposite to the vorticity in shear for DHMS- 7, 9 using planar monodomain samples, demonstrating conclusively that it is flow aligning throughout its nematic temperature range. Director rotation is solely a function of applied strain, independent of shear rate, showing that the Leslie-Ericksen theory is applicable to polymeric nematics for shear rates that are low relative to their molecular relaxation. Comparisons of the observed tumbling parameter of DHMS- 7, 9 with predictions from available molecular models lead us to infer that molecular flexibility produces shear alignment for this class of thermotropic LCPs. To identify the effect of chain flexibility on the dynamics of this LCP, the rotational viscosity and shear viscosity were measured as functions of molecular weight. Both viscosities showed weaker sensitivity to molecular weight above a characteristic molecular weight, suggesting a crossover to semiflexible character at high molecular weight. Rheology and shear orientation behavior of DHMS- 7, 9 are markedly different from that of nematic lyotropic LCPs. Synchrotron WAXS measurements in steady shear show that molecular orientation is relatively high and nearly independent of shear rate. In transient shear during flow inception, flow reversal, and step up/down shear rate, neither shear stress nor orientation parameter shows multiple oscillations. Thus, both steady and transient responses of DHMS- 7, 9 are characteristic of flow-aligning liquid crystals, in contrast to tumbling rod-like LCPs, which show complex shear rate dependence in steady shear and oscillatory response to these transient flows. An interesting feature of DHMS- 7, 9 is the existence of a mysterious liquid crystalline phase [...] Phase X. The flow behavior of Phase X is completely {{different from that of the}} nematic phase. A striking flip of the orientation from the flow direction to the vorticity direction occurs below a critical shear rate. This orientational flipping is reversible in response to step changes of temperature and/or shear rate. In addition, we found that oscillatory shear flow also induces a similar type of orientational flipping. Examination of the linear viscoelastic properties as a function of orientation in Phase X suggests rheological similarity to layered fluids. ...|$|R
