25|$|The {{properties}} of the spin representations depend, in a subtle way, on the dimension and signature of the orthogonal group. In particular, spin representations often admit invariant bilinear forms, {{which can be used}} to embed the spin groups into classical Lie groups. In low dimensions, these embeddings are surjective and determine special isomorphisms between the spin groups and more familiar Lie groups; this elucidates the {{properties of}} spinors in <b>these</b> <b>dimensions.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: Inconsistent {{results have}} been {{reported}} regarding the symptom dimensions relevant to psychosis in symptoms check list revised (SCL 90 -R), i. e., “psychoticism ” and “paranoid ideation”.

We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on the items of <b>these</b> two <b>dimensions</b> in a general population sample in Iran. Method: A total of 2158 subjects residing in Southern Tehran (capital of Iran) were interviewed using the psychoticism and paranoid ideation questions in SCL 90 -R to assess severity of <b>these</b> symptom <b>dimensions.</b> Factor analysis was done through SAS 9. 1. 3 PROC FACTOR using Promax rotation (power= 3) on the matrix of “polychoric correlations among variables ” as the input data.

Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels.
