500|$|The {{appearance}} was long in coming, and Goldblum and Stokes Mitchell {{were not the}} first actors cast in those roles, though {{they are the first}} to appear on screen. A scene had been written in 2009 for the second episode, [...] "Showmance", that featured Rachel's fathers, but it was subsequently cut from the script even though the actors had already been cast and reported for work. Shortly before the final nine episodes of the first season were to begin airing, co-creator Ryan Murphy, when asked at PaleyFest in March 2010 whether her fathers would be appearing, replied: [...] "Not this season. We've never met them; I think that's a great surprise. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to hold that a little bit." [...] Between the second and third seasons, co-creator Ian Brennan said, [...] "It's tricky with parents", referenced the scene cut from [...] "Showmance", and noted, [...] "we've talked about it forever, about different sets of parents", but [...] "when you're in high school, your parents stop being the major influence in your life". He then added, [...] "I think soon we'll probably reveal more and more".|$|E
2500|$|James Berardinelli {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The Mist is what a horror film should be—dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact. ... Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror." [...] Roger Ebert was negative, however, writing: [...] "If you have seen ads or trailers suggesting that horrible things pounce on people, and they make you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to see this movie, you will be correct. It is a competently made Horrible Things Pouncing on People Movie. If you think Frank Darabont has equaled the Shawshank and Green Mile track record, you will be sadly mistaken." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1996, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, then Lucienne Robillard, stated on the {{suggested}} alterations to the oath: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} decision to make, because I realise that when you speak about changing the oath, people <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to change all the monarchy system. We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy {{on the death of}} Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. We noticed. Consider this a holler." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is some wisits p'r'aps," [...] said Joe, [...] "as {{for ever}} remains {{open to the}} question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> {{something}},--expected something of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently after Miles {{laid his}} hand on his mother's shoulder, and said, [...] "Mother, here's a {{daughter}} who <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to turn us out because she is too slow and stupid for your home child." [...] And he drew Anne up blushing as if she were his freshly-won bride.|$|R
6000|$|Laura hesitated, {{and then}} gave him her hand. [...] "After all, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to help, and if you agree to leave Frank alone--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes," [...] she {{explains}} pathetically; [...] "but then I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> more beer. Gentlemen always open their mugs {{when they want}} them filled with beer." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{he heard}} him {{ask for a}} place as cook, he said: 'You make some mistake, my lad. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be the grand duke's dwarf, don't you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Marston laughed. [...] "After all, I'm not so dull as {{some people}} <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> didn't <b>want</b> Flora to know I had brought you pearls?" ...|$|R

60|$|Do a man a kindness, he continued, {{assuming}} a safer posture, and 'e tries {{to borrow money}} off of you; do a woman a kindness and she <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> tr marry 'er; do an animal a kindness and it tries to bite you--same as a horse bit a sailorman I knew once, when 'e sat on its head to 'elp it get up. He sat too far for'ard, pore chap.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{a little}} {{unofficial}} help. Three undetected murders {{in one year}} won't do, Lestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery with less than your usual--that's to say, you handled it fairly well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! That's so English! If {{you speak}} of emotion the English always <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{something}} physical, and are shocked. They're afraid of passion, but not of lust--oh, no!--so {{long as they can}} keep it secret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We hear a {{great deal}} too much about this thing disagreeing, and that thing disagreeing,' said the old lady, with the {{greatest}} contempt {{it was possible to}} express. 'Don't be greedy. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it all yourself.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{said the}} word clearly and truly. [...] "And I will think myself a proud and happy and honoured woman to be so, Jeff. Oh, I don't shrink from telling you the truth, you see. You mean too much to me for me to {{dissemble}} it. I've hidden it for eighteen years because I didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear it, but I'll give myself the delight of saying it frankly now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a lonesome place, for certain," [...] apologised Raidler abashedly. [...] "We got plenty, but it's rough enough. Anything <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> the boys'll ride up and fetch it {{down for}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Maria," [...] Harry said, [...] "you {{had better}} take {{a glass of}} pulque for yourself. I know you don't often touch it, but you have been working so of late that I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it {{more than any of}} us." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{you go on}} in {{that way}} about your part, I shall <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to play Mr. Gabblewig. Your rôle, though a small one on the stage, is a large one off it; and no man is more {{important}} to the Guild, both on and off.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Hugh, {{better than}} you <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> {{to get back to}} your work, and--and I should be happier. I'm not so silly and so ignorant as to think that I can satisfy you always. And I'd like to get settled at home,--I really should." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're deceiving me," [...] she declared, angrily. [...] "You're {{trying to}} make me <b>think</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> Elmhurst, when you're as anxious to get it as I am." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] Kit said, laughing, [...] "you're {{generally}} frank. I'd {{rather have}} liked to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> did <b>want</b> to see me off. Anyhow, I'm glad you have arrived." ...|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. You want money, of course. No {{one ever}} joins a {{conspiracy}} who has any. Here. (Throws money on table.) You {{have so many}} spies that I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> information. Well, you will find me the best informed man in Russia on the abuses of our Government. I made them nearly all myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to {{implicate}} any one, {{but you are}} hot-headed {{and difficult}} to deal with, and very irrational into the bargain. And, what is worse, I must say you are a little suspicious. In all this matter I have harassed myself greatly to oblige you, and in return I have got more kicks than halfpence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my golly!" [...] said Jeekie, shaking till {{his great}} knees knocked together, [...] "oh! my golly! here pretty go. She <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> bury me all alive.

6000|$|The {{passion of}} that whisper went like a stab into his breast. [...] "What am I to tell you?" [...] he murmured, {{as if with}} despair. [...] "Remember that every sunset makes it a day less. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do it, and it's a great comfort when I lie awake. I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would <b>want</b> {{something}} to help you along, you work so hard. Do you like it, Becky?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are going}} to have an easy time of it now, Karl. Count Eulenfurst is kindly going to take me off and nurse me for a bit; and you will have to stay here and look after the horses, until I return.

6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be unpleasant, Hetty," [...] said Ingleby. [...] "Anyway, {{you have}} only about an hour in which to get ready, because if we're not off by the next train it's quite likely that we shall not have the {{opportunity}} for going at all. Get what you want together, and meet us behind the booking office on the main line platform. Tom and I will take the back way to the station." ...|$|E
5000|$|Quality Comics editor Gill Fox {{recalled}} Nordling as [...] "a little guy. Good-looking. And {{involved in}} local theatre. He {{had a very}} vivid imagination and was a good writer. In later years I'd send some work in his direction. But if you did something for him, he'd <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> something back. We {{got to know each}} other socially, but he still mistrusted people. Even me. But I admired his cartooning. And he was a great guy to sit and talk to".|$|R
6000|$|Mela {{was talking}} to Mrs. Mandel, but her father {{looked up from his}} plate and listened. Mela went on: [...] "I don't know what's made the fellow quit comun'. But he was an aggravatun' thing, and no more {{dependable}} than water. It's just like Air. Fulkerson said, if he <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> him he'll take a pleasure in not lettun' you have him. I reckon that's what's the matter with Christine. I believe in my heart the girl 'll die if she don't git him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tom Foley: (1989-1995): In 2004, Foley said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> {{to bring}} bills {{to the floor}} that a {{majority}} of your party is opposed to routinely but sometimes when a great issue is at stake, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need to do that." ...|$|R
