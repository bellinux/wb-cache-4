Most of the players involved were traded to other teams, and since <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> players, minus Artest, have retired.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of a trade {{agreement}} between Colombia and Israel in 1989 the Colombian government bought a batch of 12 ex-IAF Kfir C.2s and one TC.2, which were delivered to the Colombian Air Force (FAC) in 1989–1990.

25|$|If {{the flood}} were {{responsible}} for fossilization, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> animals now fossilized must have been living together on the Earth just before the flood.

25|$|In 1990, Chuang Heng-dai (莊亨岱), by {{then the}} Commissioner of Railway Police Bureau, became the first career police officer with the {{background}} of a criminal investigator {{to take over the}} chief of NPA.

25|$|For general bivectors the {{magnitude}} {{can be calculated}} by taking the norm of the bivector considered as a vector in the space Λ2ℝn.

25|$|Until 1955 {{the flight}} courses {{took place at}} the Sirkin Airbase, before moving to the Tel Nof Airbase. In April 1966 the IAF flight course was {{transferred}} once more to Hatzerim Airbase. With the increasing need for helicopter pilots, in 1965 a helicopter flight school was established within the IAF flight school.

25|$|The desert {{force was}} now reorganized into XXX Corps and XIII Corps and renamed the Eighth Army {{under the command}} of Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham. Their next attack, Operation Crusader, was a success, and Rommel withdrew to the {{defensive}} line at Gazala, and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to El Agheila. Crusader was the first victory over the Germans by British-led forces in the war.|$|E

25|$|If one chooses any {{two points}} of {{color on the}} {{chromaticity}} diagram, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> colors that lie {{in a straight line}} between the two points can be formed by mixing these two colors.

All colors that can be formed by mixing three sources are found inside the triangle formed by the source points on the chromaticity diagram (and so on for multiple sources).|$|E
25|$|From 1956 until 1998, {{the host}} country was {{required}} to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted—although {{the host country}} was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Up to 1982, the Lightnings {{were mainly}} {{operated}} by 2 and 6 Squadron RSAF (although {{a few were}} also used by 13 Squadron RSAF), but when 6 Squadron re-equipped with the F-15 Eagle <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> remaining aircraft were operated by 2 Squadron at Tabuk. In 1985 {{as part of the}} agreement to sell the Panavia Tornado to the RSAF, the 22 flyable Lightnings were traded in to British Aerospace and returned to Warton in January 1986. While BAe offered the ex-Saudi Lightnings to Austria and Nigeria, no sales were made, and the aircraft were eventually disposed of to museums.|$|E

25|$|Li Xueqin has {{suggested}} that the board was used for divination by matching the day to be divined to the corresponding sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram, and then reading off the corresponding prognostication according to the position of the sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram. However, Lillian Tseng points out that the divination could also be done the other way round, by looking for the desired prognostication (for example an auspicious marriage day), and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> days on the Liubo board that were written on the position corresponding to the term heading the prognostication would match the desired prognostication.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel ordered German {{armoured}} divisions to the Axis fortress {{positions on}} the Egyptian border but failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk. Rommel had to withdraw from the frontier to Tobruk and achieved some tactical success in costly fighting. The need to preserve his remaining forces from destruction prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to El Agheila. It was the first victory over the German ground forces by British forces in the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, {{there was a}} serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who {{rejected}} the Hasidic movement were dubbed Mitnagdim ("opponents") by the followers of the Baal Shem Tov, who had previously called themselves Freylechn ("happy ones") and now call themselves Hasidim ("pious ones"). Some {{of the reasons for}} the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the overwhelming exuberance of Hasidic worship, their untraditional ascriptions of infallibility and alleged miracle-working to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Since <b>then,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> groups of Hasidic Judaism have been subsumed theologically into mainstream Orthodox Judaism, particularly Haredi Judaism, although cultural differences persist.|$|E

25|$|Start by {{labeling}} p1, p2 and p3 as {{the corners}} of the Sierpinski triangle, and a random point v1. Set , where rn is a random number 1, 2 or 3. Draw the points v1 to v∞. If the first point v1 was a point on the Sierpiński triangle, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> points vn lie on the Sierpinski triangle. If the first point v1 to lie within the perimeter of the triangle is not a point on the Sierpinski triangle, none of the points vn will lie on the Sierpinski triangle, however they will converge on the triangle. If v1 is outside the triangle, the only way vn will land on the actual triangle, is if vn is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large.|$|E
25|$|Operation Crusader (4th Indian, 7th Armoured, 1st South African, 2nd New Zealand and 70th British divisions) between 18 November–30 December 1941. The initial {{plan was}} to destroy the Axis {{armoured}} force before advancing its infantry. 7th Armoured were heavily defeated by the Afrika Korps at Sidi Rezegh. Rommel's subsequent advance of his armoured divisions to the Axis fortress positions on the Egyptian border failed to find {{the main body of}} the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk, so Rommel had to withdraw his armoured units to support the fighting at Tobruk. Despite achieving some tactical successes at Tobruk, the need to preserve his remaining forces prompted Rommel to withdraw his army to the defensive line at Gazala, west of Tobruk, and <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way back to El Agheila.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} reading, Moses {{instructed}} {{that when the}} Israelites approached to attack a town, they were to offer it terms of peace, and if the town surrendered, <b>then</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> people of the town were to serve the Israelites as slaves. But if the town did not surrender, then the Israelites were to lay siege to the town, and when God granted victory, kill all its men and take as booty the women, children, livestock, and {{everything else in the}} town. Those were the rules for towns that lay very far from Israel, but for the towns of the nations in the land — the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites — the Israelites were to kill everyone, lest they lead the Israelites into doing all the abhorrent things that those nations had done for their gods. A closed portion ends here.|$|E
