25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} used various equipment {{designs to}} get on the air using RTTY in the 1950s and 1960s. Amateurs used their existing receivers for RTTY operation but needed to add a <b>terminal</b> <b>unit,</b> sometimes called a demodulator, to convert the received audio signals to DC signals for the teleprinter.|$|E
25|$|Most of the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> {{equipment}} used for receiving RTTY signals was homebuilt, using designs published in amateur radio publications. These original designs {{can be divided}} into two classes of terminal units: audio-type and intermediate frequency converters. The audio-type converters proved to be more popular with amateur radio operators. The Twin City, W2JAV and W2PAT designs were examples of typical terminal units that were used into the middle 1960s. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of terminal units designed by W6FFC, such as the TT/L-2, ST-3, ST-5, and ST-6. These designs were first published in RTTY Journal starting in September 1967 and ending in 1970.|$|E

25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E

40|$|The smart {{distribution}} system {{is one of}} the most important aspects of the smart grid and will result in systematic update on the distribution side. In smart distribution grid pilot cities of China, much investment on the infrastructure for the smart {{distribution system}} has been done. For example, in Xiamen, the IEC 61968 / 61970 based data base has been established and the smart <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> such as transformer <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> distribution <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> feeder <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> and load control units have been installed. This paper proposes an automatic voltage control (AVC) architecture based on these infrastructures, all of which have been employed in Xiamen. The objective of this architecture is to minimize the distribution losses by coordinating the on load-tap changer (OLTC) and the capacitor banks. In this paper, the data base, the data communication mechanism and the related <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> for this architecture are introduced firstly. Then, an optimal power flow (OPF) model for determining the tap position of the OLTC and switching capacitor banks is also formulated. The proposed architecture is verified in a 33 -buse system. Scenarios are created to verify the impact of DG on the performance of this architecture. The results show that using the proposed architecture, distribution losses can be reduced by selecting reasonable tap position, operated capacitor banks and DG techniques. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain the desired visible images, the {{infrared}} images and the meteorological data for the inspection, a novel on-line inspection system for transmission lines is designed and proposed in this paper. The system consists of tower <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> Ethernet passive optical networks and master stations. Due to the huge monitoring data sampled by the tower <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> at each tower, Ethernet passive optical networks are used to transmit the monitoring data in real-time. The fibers in the optical fiber composite overhead ground wires are used as the trunk fibers in the communication systems. They extend from the optical line terminal to the passive optical splitters located in the splice trays at each tower. Then the optical drop fibers are used to connect the tower <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> and the splitters. A single-trunk-fiber network scheme, multiple-trunk-fiber network scheme and cascaded-OLT network scheme are proposed for the communication systems. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed inspection system were verified by simulation results and the field data...|$|R

The proposed scheme needs less parameters measurements which reduces communication and calculation burden on remote <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> (RTUs). These schemes assumes that line impedance of any section is constant. However, in general, R/X ratios are not constant along the line. Also, these schemes are not well covered the distribution systems with laterals.|$|R

5000|$|The Remote <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> is {{initially}} interrogated with what DNP3 terms an [...] "Integrity Poll" [...] (a combined Read of Class 1, 2, 3 and 0 data). This causes the Remote <b>Terminal</b> <b>Unit</b> to send all buffered events and also all static point {{data to the}} Master station. Following this, the Master polls for the event data by reading Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3. The reading of the classes can all be performed together or each class can be read at a different rate, providing a mechanism to create different reporting priorities for the different classes. After an Integrity Poll, only significant data changes are sent. This can result in significantly more responsive data retrieval than polling everything, all the time, irrespective of whether it has changed significantly.|$|E
