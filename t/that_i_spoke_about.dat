He tried just {{at first}} to {{continue}} and complete his sentence: [...] "And these organs," [...] he went on, aimlessly, [...] "these bull's-eyes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about,</b> are so arranged--so arranged--I was speaking {{on the subject of}} crustaceans, I think--crustaceans so arranged--" [...] then he broke down utterly and turned sharply round to me. He did not look at Hilda--I think he did not dare; but he faced me with his head down and his long, thin neck protruded, eyeing me from under those overhanging, penthouse brows of his. [...] "You sneak!" [...] he cried, passionately. [...] "You sneak! You have dogged me by false pretences. You have lied to bring this about! You have come aboard under a false name--you and your accomplice!" ...|$|E
5000|$|After the September 11 attacks, al-Waleed gave a cheque for $10 {{million to}} New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, despite Saudi opposition. In a written {{statement}} after his donation, he said: [...] "At times like this, we must {{address some of the}} issues that led to such a criminal attack. I believe the government of the United States of America should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause." [...] As a result of that statement, Giuliani returned his cheque. Al-Waleed said to a Saudi weekly magazine about Giuliani's rejection of his cheque, [...] "The whole issue is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> their position the Middle East conflict and they didn’t like it because there are Jewish pressures and they are afraid of them." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of Too-Rye-Ays release, the album was often written up by the media as being a [...] "Van Morrison rip-off". Rowland later denied this and commented, [...] "They werent saying I was {{influenced}} by Van. They were saying it was a rip off. But <b>I</b> made <b>that</b> clear, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> covered one of his songs for gods sake!" ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with other}} {{archetype}}s, the Apollo archetype is not gender-specific. [...] "Women often {{find that a}} particular male god exists in them as well, just as <b>I</b> found <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all… There are gods and goddesses in every person." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Bolen, the archetypes of Cassandra and Apollo are not gender-specific.

"What I {{should have}} done I am not sure," [...] Wrayson answered, [...] "but while I was talking to her the {{telephone}} bell rang, and <b>I</b> received <b>that</b> message which <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> at the inquest.

60|$|Later in {{the morning}} the storm had gone down and the sea was calm as glass, and Uncle Henry and I got Uncle William up on deck. Mr. Peters, the steward <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> before, got us a steamer chair from the first class that had been thrown away--quite good except for one leg,--and Uncle William sat in it with his face away from the sea. He seemed much shaken and looked gray and tired, but he talked quite quietly and rationally about our going to America, and how we must all work, because work is man's lot. He himself, he says, will take up the {{presidency}} of Harvard University in New York, and Uncle Henry, who, of course, was our own Grand Admiral and is a sailor, will enter as Admiral of the navy of one of the states, probably, Uncle says, the navy of Missouri, or else that of Colorado.|$|R

We seem to have {{snatched}} an hour or two out of Paradise, and it is I who have stirred up the dark waters. Let us forget it for a few more minutes!" ...|$|R

I owe a huge amount - if not all - of my success to Susan. We make a great team, and all <b>that</b> luck <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that's</b> Susan." [...] Sherlock Holmes director Guy Ritchie describes the couple as [...] "the greatest illustration of a symbiotic marriage that I've ever seen. It's a real yin and yang, and it's made him a joy to work with. Robert would be {{a pain in the}} ass if he didn't have Susan to police him."One of his biceps bears a tattoo which reads, [...] "Suzie Q" [...] as a tribute to her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accusation}} {{was also}} based on his stated belief that the administration had petitioned Interpol to lift Red Notices against numerous Iranian officials during said negotiations. The Secretary-General of Interpol at the time, Ronald Noble, noted on 15 January 2015 that no such requests had been made; “on each occasion <b>that</b> you and <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> the Interpol red notices issued in connection to the AMIA case, you stated that Interpol should keep the red notices effective,” Noble wrote in an email addressed to Timerman. On the same day of Nisman's death, a recent interview with Noble was published by the newspaper Página/12; when asked about Nisman's belief and affirmation of {{the lifting of the}} Red Notices, Noble declared: [...] "Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{not only}} that, papa--I have been {{thinking}} a good deal to-day, {{and there are other}} reasons. Of course I should wish Dr. Hoxton to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> the truth <b>about</b> <b>that</b> walk, and <b>I</b> hope you will let him know, as I appealed to you. But, on cooler thoughts, I don't believe Dr. Hoxton could seriously suspect me of such a thing as that, and it was not on <b>that</b> ground <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am turned down, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not keep up sufficient discipline, and allowed the outrage, as he calls it. Now, you know, that is, after a fashion, true. If I had not gone on like an ass the other day, and incited them to pull down the fences, they would not have done it afterwards, and perhaps I ought to have kept on guard longer. It was my fault, and we can't deny it." ...|$|R
40|$|When <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to {{the third}} Bird Control Seminar in 1966 on 2 ̆ 2 Ecological Control of Bird Hazards to Aircraft 2 ̆ 2, I {{reviewed}} what we had accomplished up to <b>that</b> time. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>about</b> {{the extent of the}} problem, the bird species involved and the methods we used to make the airports less attractive to birds that created hazards to aircraft. I wish to discuss today our accomplishments since 1966. I have presented a number of papers on the topic including one with Dr. W. W. H. Gunn, in 1967 at a meeting in the United Kingdom, and others in the United States (1968 and 1970) and at the World Conference on Bird Hazards to Aircraft in Canada in 1969. There is no longer any question about the consequences of collision between birds and aircraft. Aircraft have not become less vulnerable either. Engines on the Boeing 747 have been changed as a result of damage caused by ingested birds. Figures crossing my desk daily show that while we are reducing the number of serious incidents and cutting down repair costs, we will continue to have bird strikes. Modification of the airport environment (Solman, 1966) has gone on continuously since 1963. The Department of Transport of Canada has spent more than 10 million dollars modifying major Canadian airports to reduce their attractiveness to birds. Modifications are still going on and will continue until bird attraction has been reduced to a minimum...|$|R
40|$|The {{reason for}} the {{italicized}} 2 ̆ 2 from 2 ̆ 2 {{in the title of}} my remarks is to distinguish it from the comments <b>that</b> <b>I</b> made at our meeting in Tucson four years ago, under the title 2 ̆ 2 On Retiring to a Deanship. 2 ̆ 2 For those of you who were not there, <b>I</b> should mention <b>that</b> five years ago, as I was about to reach retirement age at the University of Michigan Law School-what the late William L.
