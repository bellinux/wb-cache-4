5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel <b>that</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E
25|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} in the literature <b>that</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> more likely to commit violent crimes than are whites in the United States. Whether {{this is the case}} for less serious crimes is less clear. Black majority cities have similar crime statistics for blacks as do cities where majority of population is white. For example, white-plurality San Diego has a slightly lower crime rate for blacks than does Atlanta, a city which has black majority in population and city government.|$|E
25|$|Featherston blames blacks, and the {{powerful}} families that control the country, largely via the Whig Party, for causing the Confederate States to lose the Great War. His rise in politics {{to the position of}} President of the Confederate States was spurred on by his dream of overthrowing the status quo, and solving race relations in the country once and for all. Featherston is so sure <b>that</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> a threat to the Confederacy that, even as the United States begins to win the war, he continues committing resources to the genocide against them.|$|E

50|$|The word blackwhite {{denotes the}} Newspeak user's ability to believe <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, to know <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, and {{to forget that}} one has ever {{believed}} the contrary. Yet it has two contradictory connotations: (i) Applied to an opponent of Ingsoc ("Impudently claiming <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, in contradiction of the plain facts") and (ii) applied {{to a member of}} the Party ("A loyal willingness to say <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white when Party discipline demands").

2500|$|The {{scene of}} Babo's shaving of Don Benito is, in Delbanco's words, [...] "a {{meditation}} on subjectivity itself." [...] Captain Delano enjoys {{the sight of}} Babo performing the kind of personal service to his master Delano thinks blacks are especially well suited for, manicuring, hair-dressing, and barbering. Don Benito, on the other hand, shakes with fear. Apparently, Babo tests the blade across his palm, and for Delano the sound {{is that of a}} man humbling himself, while Cereno hears [...] "the black man warning him: if you make one move toward candor, I will cut your throat." [...] When Delano notices that the shaving cloth covering Don Benito is the Spanish flag, he finds this use an indignity that for a moment gives him occasion to see in Babo a [...] "headsman" [...] and in Don Benito [...] "a man at the block", but quickly reassures himself <b>that</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> like children and therefore fond of bright colors, so that nothing is wrong with scene. In Delbanco's estimation, [...] "Delano's capacity for self-deception is limitless." ...|$|E

5000|$|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, {{this word}} has two {{mutually}} contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, {{it means the}} habit of impudently claiming <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, and more, to know <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, {{made possible by the}} system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.

2500|$|When {{the caller}} noted {{that she was}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "n-word" [...] by the individuals in question, Schlessinger complained <b>that</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> fine with cordially using the slur among themselves, but that it was wrong when whites used it to slur them. In doing so, she uttered [...] "nigger" [...] eleven times, albeit not directed at the caller. She discussed the word and its use by blacks and in black media. Her profuse use of the slur was mimicking the frequency of the word's use among black stand-up comics. When Hanson asked, [...] "Is it ever OK to say that word?" [...] Schlessinger responded, [...] "It depends how it’s said. Black guys talking to each other seem to think it’s OK." [...] After the call Schlessinger said, [...] "If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race." [...] Early that evening she wrote an apology to Los Angeles Radio People online journalist Don Barrett. A day later, as soon as she was back on the air, Schlessinger apologized. Hanson questioned the motivation and sincerity of Schlessinger's apology, believing it to be result of being [...] "caught." [...] Hanson also said that Schlessinger did not apologize for her comments on interracial marriage.|$|E
