5|$|In 1932, Charles Mortram Sternberg {{reported}} {{the presence of}} <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> of a large, four-footed dinosaur from Lower Cretaceous rocks in British Columbia, Canada. He described a new ichnogenus and species for these tracks, Tetrapodosaurus borealis, and attributed them to ceratopsians. However, in 1984 paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the British Columbian Tetrapodosaurus prints and argued that they were made by ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians. Specifically, Carpenter concluded that these were probably <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> of Sauropelta. Five years later, large numbers of Tetrapodosaurus tracks were discovered at the Smoky River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta. This site is considered the most important ankylosaur track site in the world.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E

Inaba Shrine was originally located on the northern side of Mount Kinka, but was moved to its present location by Saitō Dōsan during his reign over Gifu.

40|$|Despite the {{numerous}} {{studies in the}} area of urban climatology, there is still a relevant gap in this area corresponding to the demarcation of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> area on a variable.

5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E

40|$|The year of 2012 {{marks the}} 20 th anniversary since {{the concept of}} {{ecological}} footprint {{was introduced to the}} global community for the first time. Nowadays footprint studies have gained extensive debates as well as popularity.

A relatively comprehensive introduction and comparison of four key footprints is represented by listing their characteristics in different aspects. The interaction among these <b>footprints</b> within <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> family is classified into three types: overlap, contradiction and complement. The description of each type is provided in detail. Limitations and uncertainties of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> family, and priorities for further improvement are also performed.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{ecological}} <b>footprint</b> is {{a measure}} of the resources necessary to produce the goods that an individual or population consumes. It is also used as a measure of sustainability, though evidence suggests that it falls short. <b>The</b> assumptions behind <b>footprint</b> calculations have been extensively criticized; I present here further evidence that it fails to satisfy simple economic principles because the basic assumptions are contradicted by both theory and historical data. Specifically, I argue that <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> arbitrarily assumes both zero greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be ex ante optimal, and national boundaries, which makes extrapolating from <b>the</b> average ecological <b>footprint</b> problematic. <b>The</b> <b>footprint</b> also cannot take into account intensive production, and so comparisons to biocapacity are erroneous. Using only the assumptions of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> then, one could argue that the Earth can sustain greatly increased production, though there are important limitations that <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> cannot address, such as land degradation. Finally, the lack of correlation between land degradation and <b>the</b> ecological <b>footprint</b> obscures <b>the</b> effects of a larger sustainability problem. Better measures of sustainability would address these issues directly. Ecological footprint Land degradation Greenhouse gases Technological change O 13 Q 17 Q 27 Q 53 Q 56...|$|R
30|$|The soil {{migration}} {{patterns on}} the closer side of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> and below <b>the</b> spudcan change greatly at different offset distances. With the distance increasing, the soil on the spudcan bottom basically migrates downward, {{while most of the}} soil on the closer side of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> moves into <b>the</b> <b>footprint,</b> and only a little moves downward with the spudcan edge. This means “stomping” (repeated raising and lowering of the jack-up leg) may be a successful solution for the jack-up installation close to a footprint.|$|R
5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) in NOLF was significantly advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> for example, and can sound alarms or call for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, can also use its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery. Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, {{where he was}} one of those responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to remember much of what the prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's shoes were removed, and comparisons with <b>the</b> <b>footprints</b> in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, and that the only marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating at the time of her death.|$|E

40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} {{mechanism for}} varying <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> of a four-wheeled omnidirectional vehicle is developed {{and applied to}} wheelchairs. <b>The</b> variable <b>footprint</b> mechanism consists {{of a pair of}} beams intersecting at a pivotal point in the middle. Two pairs of ball wheels at the diagonal positions of the vehicle chassis are mounted, respectively, on the two beams intersecting in the middle. The angle between the two beams varies actively so that the ratio of the wheel base to the tread may change. Four independent servomotors driving the four ball wheels allow the vehicle to move in an arbitrary direction from an arbitrary configuration as well as to change the angle between the two beams and thereby change <b>the</b> <b>footprint.</b> <b>The</b> objective of controlling the beam angle is threefold. One is to augment static stability by varying <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> so that <b>the</b> mass centroid of the vehicle may be kept within <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> at all times. The second is to reduce the width of the vehicle when going through a narrow doorway. The third is to apparently change the gear ratio relating the vehicle speed to individual actuator speeds. First the concept of <b>the</b> varying <b>footprint</b> mechanism is described, and its kinematic behavior is analyzed, followed by the three control algorithms for varying <b>the</b> <b>footprint.</b> A prototype vehicle for an application of wheelchair platform is designed, built, and tested...|$|R

The digits were presumed to be stubby and ineffective, not touching the ground when the dinosaur was walking or running. They have been thought to be from an unidentified, primitive saurischian similar to Coelophysis by David B. Weishampel and L. Young more recently. Skeletal remains resembling Coelophysis have also been found in the valley, supporting the idea that a species similar to Coelophysis is responsible for <b>the</b> <b>footprints.</b>|$|E
