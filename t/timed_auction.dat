Auction based schemes are {{one of the}} best method to maximize the network Lifetime. Existing Real <b>Time</b> Effective <b>Auction</b> (RTE-A), task allocation algorithm based on Auction method is not efficient in terms of evaluating the best bid value. As it solely based on real <b>time</b> <b>auction</b> method where successor of the current task {{may not be the best}} because, in the RTE-A the auction process is stopped as soon as auctioneer get bid value higher than threshold value. Real <b>Time</b> Effective <b>Auction</b> (RTE-A) algorithm is too stringent with respect to time constraints. But many applications may require resource allocation process which is flexible w. r. t time constraints. In our proposed algorithm a soft real <b>time</b> <b>auction</b> approach is used. Where winner of the auction process is not decided as soon as auctioneers get the bid value higher than threshold value But Auctioneer will have a particular time slot, which is based on application requirement. The auctioneer will decide winner at the end of the specific time slot based on maximum bid value [...] In our proposed algorithm (SRT-A), we also improve real time task allocation approach by using wait time at the bidder side. The wait time method, tries to get the best bid value by allowing the node with highest bid value to bid earlie...|$|R

Such Internet auction mechanisms have the scope of incorporating procedures of much greater complexity and variety, and they exhibit characteristics and properties that are quite distinct from conventional auctions. In this paper, the authors provide an experimental study of the performance characteristics and operational behaviour of a number of online auction models, including the fixed <b>time</b> forward <b>auctions,</b> the Vickrey auctions, as well as models with soft close variable <b>auction</b> <b>times.</b> These online <b>auction</b> models are studied through systematic simulation experiments, based on a series of operational assumptions, which characterise the arrival rate of bids, as well as the distribution from which the private values of buyers are sampled. The behaviour of the average auction income and average auction duration are quantified and compared, and suggestions for efficient online auction design, and procedures for improving auction performance are given.

40|$|We study a {{fundamental}} problem in micro economics called optimal auction design: A seller wishes to sell an item {{to a group}} of self-interested agents. Each agent i has a privately known valuation vi for the object. Given a distribution on these valuations, the goal is to construct an optimal auction, i. e. a truth revealing protocol that maximizes the seller’s expected revenue. We study this problem from a computational perspective and show several lower bounds. In particular we prove that no deterministic polynomial <b>time</b> <b>auction</b> can achieve an approximation ratio better than 3 4. This result applies to many other problems, such as the design of combinatorial auctions. The probability distribution constructed in our example has sensitive dependencies among the agents. On the flip side, we show that if the agents are not strongly dependent, the problem can be approximated within a factor close to 1. ...|$|R

In 2013, the foundation announced its plan to sell another group of paintings and sculptures — including pieces by Twombly, Chamberlain and Barnett Newman — at Sotheby's, this time hoping to raise at least $20 million for an acquisition budget and to pay for 30 works that have been on long-term loan to Dia from the Lannan Foundation. In response, founders Heiner Friedrich and Fariha de Menil filed suit in New York Supreme Court, seeking an injunction against the foundation and Sotheby's while raising {{the possibility that some}} of the works might not be legally owned by Dia but constitute long-term loans from the Friedrichs.
