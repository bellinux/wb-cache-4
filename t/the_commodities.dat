5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player controls a ship and seeks out three artifacts {{to defeat the}} game's final boss, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The player explores the map to gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, {{all of which can}} be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, which can be used to buy upgrades for the ship. <b>The</b> <b>commodities</b> are stored in the cargo hold, the capacity of which can be upgraded with gold.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{there has been}} growing talk of {{investing}} in <b>commodities</b> in <b>the</b> financial markets. In <b>the</b> past, <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> markets served for purposes of the producers and <b>the</b> end-users of <b>commodities.</b> With gradual innovation of the financial markets in the 19 th and 20 th century <b>the</b> modern <b>commodity</b> markets evolved and became more standardized. This process was accompanied by the increasing interest of financial speculators. In contrast with the commercial participants, the goal of these new investors in <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> markets is not to hedge against adverse changes in commodity prices but to profit on the price movements of <b>commodities.</b> <b>The</b> inflow of this group was intensified {{by the development of}} new financial instruments enabling these investors to enter <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> markets. It is undisputable that speculators have positive effect on the markets, by providing liquidity and lowering transaction costs. What remains to be answered is the real effect which the speculators have on <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, and if their action does not create distortion in <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. <b>The</b> price development on <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> markets during <b>the</b> recent financial crisis gives strong arguments in the hands of those accusing the speculators of the negative impact on <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> prices, which sometimes lead to creation of price bubbles. The goal of this thesis will be the analysis of the effect of speculators on <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> markets, and if this prejudice is justified...|$|R

50|$|Commodity form {{theory is}} related to Marx's theory of {{commodity}} fetishism. Marx argued that <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> was a fetishized form because the formal equality that <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> form postulated was only an apparent equality. The legal form is blind to substantive human differences, just as <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> form is blind to substantive differences in use value. Ultimately, the legal form, just as <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> form, exists independently of {{the will of the}} individual. The illusion is proceed that the law - as the universal political equivalent - has a life of its own.|$|R

By representing a credible commitment to return to <b>the</b> <b>commodity</b> standard, <b>the</b> suspension of cash payments maintains the value and circulation of money.

The city's large companies (the Unio wagon factory, the Princz Factory, the Ardeleana textile enterprise, the Freund petroleum refinery, the brick factory and the furniture factory) prospered in this period, and the city invested heavily in communication lines, schools, hospitals, public works and public parks. The banking and commerce system also developed: in 1929 the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as <b>the</b> <b>commodities</b> stock market were established, with 25 commercial enterprises and 75 industrial and production firms as members.

25|$|Commercial {{opportunities}} {{in the capital of}} the Dutch colony attracted Indonesian and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740 and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number which changed little during the following decades.
