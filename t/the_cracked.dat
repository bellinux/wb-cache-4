5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced to ditch.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>crack</b> {{processes}} in single-phase alumina specimens {{have been investigated}} by acoustic emission (AE) analysis {{with regard to the}} increase of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> resistance. During loading of a notched specimen, individual AE signals are observed at first, which are probably due to the generation of microcracks in a process zone around the notch. At higher loads signal clusters are found, which should be due to the coalescence of microcracks. By these coalescence events <b>the</b> main <b>crack</b> is formed. At microscopic crack propagation most AE events are located within <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip zone. However, up to about 20 % of all events are located within <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> flank zone behind <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip. Thus, it can be concluded that there is an energy dissipation at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip at beginning of the loading, which determines the starting value of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> resistance, too.

5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits.

Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E

40|$|The plastic {{deformation}} processes around a crack tip at an atomic scale level under cyclic loading are examined using a molecular dynamics simulation. In this study, {{we deal with}} not only a specimen including both a crack and grain boundaries but also a specimen including only a <b>crack.</b> For <b>the</b> specimen including both <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> grain boundaries, we can observe the emission of edge dislocations in order to relax stress concentration around <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip during loading. The dislocations emitted from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip return to <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip because of interaction between dislocations during unloading. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> propagates due to coalescence of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip and <b>the</b> vacancies caused by the repeat of the dislocation emission and absorption at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip.

30|$|After a crack initiates from a {{pre-existing}} flaw, {{the manner}} in which this crack propagates dictates whether the bridging fibers will be ruptured or pulled out. A lot of this depends on the opening magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>crack.</b> If crack opening is large, rupturing or pulling out of fibers on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> flanks will be inevitable as <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> propagates. In an ideally brittle material, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> opening is known to scale parabolically with distance behind <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tips, which means that <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> opening will increase indefinitely with <b>the</b> propagating <b>crack</b> length. In normal fiber reinforced concrete, the parabolic shaped opening near <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip is modified by the closing pressure of bridging fibers, but otherwise follows the same trend in terms of crack opening scaling with <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> length. This implies that <b>the</b> bridged <b>crack</b> must undergo tension softening as fibers are ruptured or pulled out in such composites. This is the normal scenario for ordinary fiber reinforced concrete.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, I+II mixed mode notch-crack fatigue {{propagation}} in {{titanium alloy}} steel TA 2 was tested {{with the emphasis}} on <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> mode transition and retardation under constant amplitude loading or overloading. Finite element method was employed to calculate the stress distribution at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip in order to explain <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> growth behavior. It is found that after initiation from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip, <b>the</b> new formed <b>crack</b> propagates in a mode I form, regardless of the magnitudes of the inclined angle of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> overloading applied. The relationship between <b>the</b> fatigue <b>crack</b> growth rate and mode I stress intensity factor range was calculated. After overloading, crack initiation and propagation will be significantly slowed, or in other words, there exists overloading retardation.

40|$|In certain {{ceramics}} one observes {{an increase}} in crack resistance with increasing crack length (R-curve behaviour).

25|$|The {{energy of}} the nuclear {{explosion}} is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable {{with the weight of}} the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. <b>The</b> <b>cracked</b> zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a seismic wave. A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting {{on the bottom of the}} cavity and the cavity content begins cooling. The rebound after the shock wave causes compressive forces to build up around the cavity, called a stress containment cage, sealing the cracks.|$|E
