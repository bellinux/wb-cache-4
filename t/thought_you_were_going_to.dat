60|$|HARRY. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{play tennis}} this afternoon.|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Splendid! Oh, what a relief! I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be broken-hearted. Never mind me. Damn him again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fooled {{you that}} time, didn't I, Peter?" [...] he chuckled. [...] "You <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see Glory the Cardinal, didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Pierre," [...] Harry {{said to the}} fisherman, who {{was waiting}} outside for him, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on with your boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} turning back," [...] she said. [...] "Why did you turn back? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> over the divide to Little Grizzly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought we}} had parted {{when you came to}} Lowick many weeks ago--you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> then," [...] said Dorothea, her voice {{trembling}} a little.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When are {{you going}} to settle {{yourself}} in some Christian sort of place, Liz? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it before now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who! I?' exclaimed the Marquis. 'I {{never was}} wider awake. What {{are you waiting}} for, Reginald? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take wasps' nests.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello! you {{are back}} early," [...] remarked Spud, when Sam {{appeared}} at Brill. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make {{an evening of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Somers: [...] "I didn't mean that. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to--go." [...] She puts up {{her hand}} and hides a triumphant little smile with it.|$|R
60|$|Just now, this afternoon, I {{would never}} have said what I did only I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> I wasn't myself then, Ronny. I ought never to have....|$|R
6000|$|De Stancy {{jumped up}} from his chair, and went forward to the new-comer. 'You are not long behind us, then,' he said, with laconic disquietude. 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{straight}} home?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say something," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Tipping, scathingly, [...] "and {{you might}} as well talk about that as anything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Mr. Cuthbert, [...] "I'll {{manage that}} all right. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see the {{representative}} of a syndicate at eleven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Besides, mutual {{discipline}} {{is not a}} thing to upset. Lily, I revere you! I never <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn out such a sensible mother.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Freeling's {{turn now}} to jump up in surprise. [...] "You don't mean to tell me, Arthur, {{that that was the}} sole ground on which that old fool, Warminster, <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> crazy?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never <b>going</b> {{to leave}} the lady in black velvet.|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>thought</b> if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to haul up Cayman for scraping, you'd like to {{know our}} tug is off the slip," [...] the other remarked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] said Forster; [...] "but I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ring Grimes {{about that}} theatre party for Thursday night. Had you {{forgotten}} about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Men {{are very}} clumsy,' said she. 'I {{knew you were}} on every train. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak to me, and I'm glad you didn't.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Thank you, Felix,' {{said the}} Curate; 'it {{is a great}} relief to me. I was afraid you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring a meddling fellow in upon you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; only I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> might <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to the yacht; and Valencia {{would have}} walked down with you. She {{wants to find}} Major Campbell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fancy {{seeing you}} here, George!" [...] said Billie. [...] "We're always meeting, aren't we? How {{did you come}} to {{separate}} yourself from the pigs and chickens? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never <b>going</b> to leave them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>THOUGHT</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never <b>going</b> to {{have done}} with that old Jupiter," [...] said Mrs. Peacocke, as she began at that late hour of the evening to make tea {{for herself and her}} husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} how you see things. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say you would marry me!" [...] Benyon rejoined, standing there still, though the dray had passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "My head {{is going}} round," [...] she declared. [...] "This is Wednesday. Besides, I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay away until I wrote you--not that I wanted you to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell me something I didn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Maynard fully {{shared the}} opinion which rocked Dr. Mulbridge's defeat with {{a belief in}} his invincible will. When it became necessary, {{in the course of}} events which made Grace and Libby resolve upon a short engagement, to tell her that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> married, she {{expressed}} a frank astonishment. [...] "Walter Libby!" [...] she cried. [...] "Well, I am surprised. When I <b>was</b> talking to <b>you</b> the other day about getting married, of course I supposed it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> Dr. Mulbridge. I {{did n't want you to}} marry him, but I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think they're Godlike," [...] said Moggs junior. After {{that they}} were silent for a while, during which Moggs senior was cutting his nails with a shoemaker's knife by the fading light of the evening, and Moggs junior was summing up an account against a favoured aristocrat, {{who seemed to have}} worn a great many boots, but who was {{noticeable}} to Ontario, chiefly from the fact that he represented in Parliament the division of the county in which Percycross was situated. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make it all straight by marrying that girl," [...] said Moggs senior.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ronnie," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> down in Norfolk for a week! Come in. Bring {{your chair}} {{up to my}} side, so. This {{is one of my}} deaf mornings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] says he, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{ask me for}} {{something}} of some account. If that is all you want, it is yours, and welcome to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{not likely}} to have a chance. But I say, Ken, how did you happen to turn up? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hop on the first train for home." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder what}} you do succeed in? Your book was very successful, wasn't it? You <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> set the Thames on fire, and the book fell flat, flat, flat.|$|E
6000|$|... "A terrible scene, child, and {{it would}} have been just as well if you had stayed at home and slept comfortably. If I had <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> so foolish, I would not have gone myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--but I can say {{so without}} his telling me. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> banishing {{him from his}} own house. He has {{put up with it}} while he <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to this foreign country; but there must be an end of that now. You must have some scheme of life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Robinson, don't {{you talk}} like that. You wouldn't {{take it all}} calm that way if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have him." ...|$|R
