2500|$|In July, {{the second}} of two prototypes was sent to France for service trials, which were successful, aircrew being {{generally}} quite favourably impressed; and by September production was well under way. [...] The Vickers-Challenger interrupter gear and the Scarff ring were still in short supply, being required for the Sopwith 1½ Strutter and other types, and a few early R.E.8s were built with a pillar mounting for the observer’s gun as an interim measure. An alternative to the pilot's synchronised Vickers had been designed, consisting of a fixed Lewis gun with deflector plates <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> although this was never used, a Vickers gun for the pilot being mounted {{on the port side}} of the fuselage in a similar position to that on the B.E.12, at first synchronised by the Vickers-Challenger gear and then by the improved Constantinesco hydraulic gear. Photographs of this armament installation make it clear that the cocking handle of the Vickers gun was in easy reach of the pilot and that a normal Aldis sight was mounted in the pilot's windscreen, giving the lie to statements that the forward firing gun could not be sighted properly due to its position.|$|R
40|$|The {{high speed}} vessels are {{primarily}} designed for short distances services as public transport of passengers and vehicles. The range of high speed, {{according to the}} Code of high-speed vessels begins at 20 knots, which depends on the cruise speed you desire for your vessel; {{you will have to}} use the most appropriate type of propellant. In general, in the past 20 years, they have been building high-speed vessels with speeds above 33 knots, which meant installing water jet propellants coupled to powerful engines and therefore of high consumption of fuel, increasing operating costs and causing increased air pollution. Although the prices of fuel have been reduced to half, due to the sharp fall in oil prices, the consumption of fuel and the air pollution remains high at these speeds and powers used, in addition to that the reduction of the time spent on each trip is not excessive, mainly in short routes that are less than an hour. This article is about adapting a ship of high-speed service, with a maximum speed in tests of 34 knots and to reduce its operating costs (fuel, maintenance, etc.) and make it economically viable; before the transformation, this vessel was operating with a service speed of 22 knots, and with a consumption per mile of 135 litters of MGO. The transformation process has consisted by: – Replacement of the two original water jet with four shaft lines with fix pitch propeller. – Replacement of the two original main engines (2 x 6500 kW = 13000 kW) by four engines (4 x 1380 kW = 5. 520 kW). – Changing the underwater hull shape <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> new <b>propellers</b> and maximize its efficiency. – Relocation of auxiliary engines, to achieve the most efficient trim. – Installation of two lateral propellers to improve maneuverability and shorten the total time of journey. After the reform and the return to service of the vessel with a service speed of over 22 knots, it has been verified that the consumption per mile is of 45 litters MGO, representing a reduction of 65 % of consumption and even more reduction of emissions as the new engines comply with the latest regulations.

2500|$|When {{shown at}} the Paris Aero Salon in December 1908, the {{aircraft}} was powered by a [...] 7-cylinder R.E.P. engine driving a four-bladed paddle-type <b>propeller.</b> <b>The</b> aircraft was first flown at Issy-les-Moulineaux on 23 January 1909, but although the aircraft handled well, the engine proved extremely unreliable and, {{at the suggestion of}} his mechanic Ferdinand Collin, Blériot made contact with Alessandro Anzani, a famous motorcycle racer whose successes were due to the engines that he made, and who had recently entered the field of aero-engine manufacture. [...] On 27 May 1909, a [...] Anzani 3-cylinder fan-configuration (semi-radial) engine was <b>fitted.</b> <b>The</b> <b>propeller</b> was also replaced with a Chauvière Intégrale two-bladed propeller made from laminated walnut wood.
