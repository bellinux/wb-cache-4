25|$|The {{contamination}} was {{the result}} of the activities of a local asbestos factory, part of the Turner & Newall (<b>T)</b> <b>group</b> (often referred to by the name of its founders, J.W. Roberts Ltd.) and occurred between the end of the 19th century and 1959 when the factory eventually closed. At its peak the factory had 250 employees. At least 300 former employees are believed to have died from asbestos-related illnesses, and a number of cancer deaths in the Armley area were traced to the factory in 1988 as a result of an investigation by the Yorkshire Evening Post. The estate was found to have the highest incidence in the country of mesothelioma. As the interval between exposure and diagnosis can be up to 50 years the number of further deaths which may occur due to the factory's emissions or residual dust since its closure cannot be predicted.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} reverse transcriptase A 181 T (rtA 181 T) mutation in hepatitis B virus (HBV) on autophagy of Huh 7 hepatoma cells. MethodsHuh 7 hepatoma cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) 1. 3 mer HBV plasmids (WT group), 1. 3 mer HBV rtA 181 T mutant plasmids (181 <b>T</b> <b>group),</b> or WT and rtA 181 T mutant plasmids {{at a ratio of}} 1 ∶ 1 (WT+ 181 <b>T</b> <b>group).</b> Western blot and immunofluorescence assay were performed to measure the expression of intracellular HBV surface protein (HBs), and ELISA was used to measure the expression of extracellular HBsAg. Western blot was used to measure the expression of endogenous autophagy-related proteins microtubule-associated light chain 3 -II (LC 3 -Ⅱ) and P 62, and Real time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression of autophagy-related genes Atg 5 and Beclin 1. After transfection with green fluorescent protein-LC 3, immunofluorescence assay was used to measure autophagy particles. An analysis of variance was used for comparison of continuous data between multiple groups and the LSD-t test was used for further comparison between any two groups. ResultsImmunofluorescence assay showed that there was expression of HBs in the 181 <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> WT group, and WT+ 181 <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> and the 181 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> had significantly higher expression of intracellular HBs than the WT group and WT+ 181 <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> The results of ELISA showed that there were significant differences in the level of HBsAg in cell culture supernatant between the three groups (F= 66. 739, P＜ 0. 001), and the 181 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> had a significantly lower level of extracellular HBsAg than the WT group and WT+ 181 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (0. 111 ± 0. 056 vs 3. 157 ± 0. 490 / 2. 240 ± 0. 797, both P＜ 0. 001). The WT group, 181 <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> and WT+ 181 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> all showed the aggregation of LC 3 -II autophagy particles; compared with the WT group and WT+ 181 <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> the 181 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> had significantly higher expression of LC 3 -II and significantly lower expression of P 62 (both P＜ 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To compare 3. 0 Tesla (T) vs 1. 5 T {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging systems in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. METHODS: Upon Institutional Review Board approval, a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective review of 147 consecutive 3. 0 T MR examinations and 98 consecutive 1. 5 T MR examinations {{in patients with}} newly diagnosed breast cancer between 7 / 2009 and 5 / 2010 was performed. Eleven patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the 3. 0 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> were excluded. Mammographically occult suspicious lesions (BIRADS Code 4 and 5) additional to the index cancer in the ipsilateral and contralateral breast were identified. Lesion characteristics and pathologic diagnoses were recorded, and results achieved with both systems compared. Statistical significance was analyzed using Fisher&#x 2019;s exact test. RESULTS: In the 3. 0 <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> 206 suspicious lesions were identified in 55 % (75 / 136) of patients and 96 % (198 / 206) of these lesions were biopsied. In the 1. 5 <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> 98 suspicious lesions were identified in 53 % (52 / 98) of patients and 90 % (88 / 98) of these lesions were biopsied. Biopsy results yielded additional malignancies in 24 % of patients in the 3. 0 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> vs 14 % of patients in the 1. 5 <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (33 / 136 vs 14 / 98, P = 0. 07).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eleven patients operated on with the TERPT technique (<b>T</b> <b>Group)</b> were prospectively registered and compared retrospectively with 18 patients operated on with the Duhamel pull-through (D Group). Data recorded included patient demographics, operative treatment, complications, hospital stay and bowel functions. The follow-up time was limited to 24 months. RESULTS: The <b>T</b> <b>Group</b> started oral feeding sooner, their bowel movements started sooner and they had less need for analgesia postoperatively and a significantly shorter hospital stay. 71 % of the patients in the D Group needed re-intervention compared to only 18 % of the <b>T</b> <b>Group.</b> Enterocolitis was seen in two patients in both groups. At the last clinical control ten patients had constipation (59 %) and three had soiling (18 %) in the D Group.

40|$|Introduction Physical {{training}} {{is an important}} method in the rehabilitation programme for cardiovascular patients. Nevertheless, some controversies about physical training in patients with heart failure still exist. Objective The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the effects of continuous physical training on exercise tolerance, ejection fraction and regional systolic and diastolic left ventricular (LV) myocardial function in patients with stable heart failure. Method The study involved 48 male patients with stable heart failure and LV ejection fraction ≤ 35 % determined by echocardiography. At the end of a two-week residential rehabilitation programme, the patients were divided in two groups. The group of 27 patients (<b>T</b> <b>group)</b> continued with regular physical training (4 to 5 times weekly) during 6 months, while 21 patients (K group) did not have regular physical training. In all patients, the exercise test and echocardiography studies were performed after residential rehabilitation and 6 months later. Regional myocardial function of LV was evaluated by the pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging. Results After 6 months, an increase in exercise tolerance was more significant in <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> LV ejection fraction increased significantly (p< 0. 05) only in <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> After six months, in <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> regional systolic (p< 0. 01) and diastolic (p< 0. 005) myocardial function improved significantly, while in K group a significant improvement was seen only for regional diastolic function (p< 0. 05), and it was less than in <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusion The results of our study suggest that continuous physical training during the period of 6 months in patients with stable heart failure induced significant improvement of exercise tolerance, ejection fraction and regional systolic and diastolic LV myocardial function...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Severe acute {{pancreatitis}} (SAP) {{can lead to}} acute lung injury (ALI). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the protective effect of clodronate-containing liposomes on ALI in rats with SAP. Methods: The thin film method was used to prepare liposomes. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. After the SAP model was established by injecting 5 % (w/v) sodium taurocholate (2 ml/kg body weight) into the subcapsular space of the pancreata, normal saline was administered to the control (C) group, phosphate buffer solution (PBS) -containing liposome to the P group, and clodronate-containing liposome to the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> through tail veins. Blood samples were obtained from the superior mesenteric vein at 2 and 6 h to measure the levels of amylase, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Morphological changes in the pancreata and lung were observed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, while cell apoptosis was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). In addition, the macrophage marker cluster of differentiation 68 (CD 68) in lung tissue was detected with immunohistochemistry. Results: Blood levels of amylase, IL- 6, and TNF-α were significantly increased in the P group compared to those in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05). In the <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> large numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were observed, but no or few in the C and P groups. Gross inspection and H&E staining of pancreata and lung showed dramatic tissue damage, including inflammation and necrosis in the P group. Less remarkable changes were noted in the <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> and the C group exhibited normal histology. The histological scores according to Kaiser’s criteria were consistent with H&E findings. The number of CD 68 -positive macrophages decreased in the <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: Clodronate-containing liposomes have a protective effect against ALI in rats with SAP.

The study of two-agent combination regimens has important clinical significance. We conducted this randomized controlled phase II trial to comparatively evaluate the efficacy and side effects of capecitabine combined with docetaxel in previously treated patients with NSCLC. Patients with previously treated NSCLC who failed first-line chemotherapy were randomized into two groups; one received capecitabine combined with docetaxel (XT group) and the other received docetaxel alone (<b>T</b> <b>group).</b> Patients in the XT group received chemotherapy as follows: capecitabine 625 mg/m 2, p. o. bid, days 5 - 18; and docetaxel 30 mg/m 2, days 1 and 8, while patients in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> received docetaxel 35 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP), and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), response rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR). Forty-eight patients were recruited (23 in the XT group and 25 in the <b>T</b> <b>group).</b> TTP, median survival time (MST) and 1 -year OS rate in the XT group and the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> were 7 months, 12 months, 47. 6 % and 3 months, 12 months, 39. 6 %, respectively. The TTP in the XT group was significantly longer compared to that in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (χ 2 = 4. 763, p= 0. 029). The RR and DCR in the XT group and <b>T</b> <b>group</b> were 13. 0 % (3 / 23), 78. 3 % (18 / 23) and 12. 0 % (3 / 25), 76 % (19 / 25), respectively. The difference was not significant (p> 0. 05). The major side effects observed in the two groups were neutropenia, fatigue and nausea, and toxicities were mild to modest. No severe cases of hand-foot syndrome were observed in the XT group. In conclusion, compared with docetaxel alone, capecitabine combined with docetaxel for patients with previously treated NSCLC achieved a significantly longer TTP and this regimen was well tolerated.

A high Arg:Lys ratio resulted in significantly higher BW gain until 98 d of age (10. 03 vs. 9. 84 kg; P is less than or equal to 0. 024). The Arg:Lys ratio did not affect feed:gain throughout the experiment. Dietary electrolyte balance did not affect performance parameters. No consistent two- or three-way interactions were observed. Processing yields were only affected significantly by T, and not by Arg:Lys ratio or DEB main effects.

40|$|Background: Pancreatic fistula (PF) {{is one of}} {{post-operative}} complications in pancreatic surgery, {{but there}} is no consensus about the optimal treatment for PF. Our group has established a rat model of PF, and we conducted the present investigation to determine the efficacy of the triple-drug therapy (somatostatin analogue, gabexate mesilate, and imipenem/cilastatin) against PF using our rat model. Methods: In the PF rat model, the triple-drug therapy was administered to the treated (<b>T)</b> <b>group</b> (n = 4), and we compared the results with those of a control (C) group (n = 4). The rats were sacrificed on postoperative day 3 (POD 3) and the levels of amylase and lipase in serum and ascites were measured. The intra-abdominal adhesion was scored. Each pancreas was evaluated pathologically, and inflammation was scored. Results: The ascitic amylase levels on POD 3 were 1982 (1738 – 2249) IU/L in the C group and significantly lower at 136 (101 – 198) IU/L in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 02). The ascitic lipase levels on POD 3 were 406 (265 – 478) U/L in the C group and significantly lower at 13 (7 – 17) U/L in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 02). The intra-abdominal adhesion score on POD 3 was 2 (1 – 2) in the C group and significantly lower at 0 (0 – 1) in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 02). The histological evaluation showed that the average of pancreatic inflammatory score was 8. 5 (8 – 9) in the C group and significantly milder at 5 (5 – 7) in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 01).

In colonocytes isolated from rats in the <b>T</b> <b>group,</b> the concentration of GSH (7. 9 ± 1. 4 vs. 11. 3 ± 0. 4 nmol/mg protein, p < 0. 05) and the activities of GST (104. 4 ± 10. 3 vs. 146. 2 ± 18. 5 mU/mg protein, p < 0. 05) and SOD (74. 4 ± 8. 9 vs. 99. 8 ± 7. 5 U/mg protein, p < 0. 05) were lower, but the activity of GPx (430. 0 -± 14. 1 vs. 283. 9 ± 10. 0 mU/mg protein, p < 0. 05) was {{higher than in the}} S group. As expected, the activity of MPO in the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> was higher than in the S group (371. 2 ± 14. 7 vs. 158. 9 ± 8. 4 mU/mg tissue, p< 0. 05) and histologically, colitis was only observed in rats in the <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> In conclusion, the {{functional status}} of antioxidants in the colonic epithelial cells of rats challenged with TNBS solution is impaired. This impariment may make them more susceptible to oxidative damage that may {{contribute to the development of}} the lesions observed in this model. Further studies at the molecular level are necessary to investigate these novel findings in this model and their potential application for testing new therapeutic approaches in inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract...|$|E
40|$|Prenatal {{testosterone}} (T) excess causes reproductive and metabolic disruptions including insulin resistance, {{attributes of}} women with polycystic ovary syndrome. This study tested the hypothesis that insulin resistance contributes toward severity of reproductive disruptions in prenatally T-treated females. Pregnant sheep were injected im with 100 mg of T-propionate semiweekly from d 30 – 90 of gestation. Immediately after the first breeding season, a subset of controls and prenatal T-treated (TR) sheep were administered an insulin sensitizer (rosiglitazone; 8 mg/d) orally for 8 months. Untreated control and prenatal T-treated females (<b>T</b> <b>group)</b> were studied in parallel. Biochemical analyses revealed rosiglitazone to be safe for use in sheep. Glucose tolerance tests performed {{before and after the}} insulin sensitizer treatment found that insulin sensitizer decreased cumulative insulin, cumulative insulin/glucose ratio, and insulin area under the curve by about 50 % and increased the insulin sensitivity index by about 70 % in the TR compared with the <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> Twenty percent of TR females showed a reduced number of cycles in the second relative to first breeding season as opposed to 80 % of <b>T</b> <b>group</b> females showing such deterioration. Insulin sensitizer treatment also decreased the number of aberrant cycles (≥ 18 d) during the second breeding season in the TR group relative to the first as opposed to the <b>T</b> <b>group</b> females showing an increase in the second breeding season relative to the first. These findings provide evidence that insulin sensitizer treatment prevents further deterioration of the reproductive axis in prenatal T-treated sheep, a finding of translational relevance to women with polycystic ovary syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that troponin (Tn) elevation during acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD) may predict {{an increase in}} mortality risk. We performed an observational study of 935 patients admitted to hospital for AECOPD from January 2010 to December 2012. Principal clinical and laboratory data were recorded, especially ischemic heart disease (IHD) history, Tn T values and cardiovascular drug prescription. The occurrence of all-cause death, cardiac death (CD), nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) was assessed on December 2013. Overall, 694 patients respected inclusion and exclusion criteria. We identified 210 (30 %) patients without Tn elevation (negative Tn <b>T</b> <b>group)</b> and 484 (70 %) patients with Tn elevation (positive Tn <b>T</b> <b>group).</b> With the exception of CVA, all adverse events were significantly higher in positive Tn <b>T</b> <b>group</b> as compared to negative Tn <b>T</b> <b>group.</b> At multivariable analysis, positive Tn T failed to predict all-cause death. Contrarily, positive Tn T emerged as independent predictors of CD (HR 1. 61, 95 %CI 1. 2 - 2. 2, p = 0. 04), nonfatal MI (HR 3. 12, 95 %CI 1. 4 - 8. 1, p = 0. 03) and composite endpoint including CD and nonfatal MI (HR 1. 73, 95 %CI 1. 2 - 2. 7, p = 0. 03). Of note, positive Tn T stratified prognosis in patients without IHD history, but not in those with IHD history. In conclusion, after hospital admission for AECOPD, we observed {{a significant increase in the}} risk of cardiac adverse events in patients with Tn T elevation, especially in those without IHD history...|$|E
