25|$|Wittgenstein's {{influence}} has been felt {{in nearly every}} field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright: He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he {{felt as though he}} was writing for people who would <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.|$|E

However, the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace, {{in a set of}} notes written in 1842 about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, a precursor (never built) to modern electronic computers. [...] Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> humanlike way. [...] She wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E
500|$|Today many {{followers}} of universalist {{schools of thought}} continue to oppose the idea of linguistic relativity, seeing it as unsound or even ridiculous. For example, Steven Pinker argues in his book The Language Instinct that thought exists prior to language and independently of it, a view also espoused by philosophers of language such as Jerry Fodor, John Locke and Plato. In this interpretation, language is inconsequential to human thought because humans do not think in [...] "natural" [...] language, i.e. any language used for communication. Rather, we <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> meta-language that precedes natural language, which Pinker following Fodor calls [...] "mentalese." [...] Pinker attacks what he calls [...] "Whorf's radical position", declaring, [...] "the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make." [...] Scholars of a more [...] "relativist" [...] bent such as John A. Lucy and Stephen C. Levinson have criticized Pinker for misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against strawmen.|$|E
500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

Shaky cam… Hopefully what we strived for was to go a little retro in how you shoot action scenes." [...] The film was shot in 3-D and its real 3D shots were done by lead stereographer Florian Maier and his team from Stereotec. Wirkola said: [...] "We shot half of it in real 3D and the other half was post converted. Actually the 3D thing wasn’t there in the beginning. It was something the studio suggested later on. We embraced it and I think it actually really helps in getting people into this fairy tale world." [...] The filming process took three months. A 12-minute B-roll footage was later released on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|Garbage {{wanted to}} write a song that {{incorporated}} a very thumpy and repetitive bass line; this would act as a hook. Continuing to develop the demo throughout the recording process for what would eventually become the band's debut album, the group decided to add textures, guitars, and keys to make [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] dynamic rather than built on complicated chord changes. Marker and Vig then added in elements of ambient sound effects throughout the audio mix; including the [...] "glitchy" [...] sound of a broken DAT player used during the pre-chorus. Marker had been dubbing between audio tracks, resulting in scratchy feedback; he sampled the sound and tuned it to fit the song, unintentionally created by an alternative hook. When Manson recorded her first vocals for [...] "Stupid Girl", the band realised that the key that the song had been arranged in was too low, but instead of re-recording the guitars, Vig re-printed them through a pitch-change patch on an effects unit. Erikson commented that the effects are [...] "just ear candy, but they contribute to the character of the song, make the listener <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain way about the song". Additional percussion on [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was performed by Madison musician Pauli Ryan, while the bass guitar line was played on record by Milwaukee session bassist Mike Kashou, both of whom performed on a number of tracks on the band's debut album.|$|E

I honestly <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way, this is a hint of a delayed reaction, emotionally, to that." [...] Havins felt that JR's murder attempt on Babe seemingly came out of nowhere: It happened so fast, and the resolve was {{in the blink of an}} eye. I would walk away for a lot less! I think she was so wanting to get that family unit back on track that she didn't allow herself the proper time to heal. Then, on top of it, here's Josh.

2500|$|Although McKenna avoided {{giving his}} {{allegiance}} {{to any one}} interpretation (part of his rejection of monotheism), he was open {{to the idea of}} psychedelics as being [...] "trans-dimensional travel". He proposed that DMT sent one to a [...] "parallel dimension" [...] and that psychedelics literally enabled an individual to encounter 'higher dimensional entities' or what could be ancestors or spirits of the Earth, saying that if you can trust your own perceptions it appears that you are entering an [...] "ecology of souls." [...] McKenna also put forward the idea that psychedelics were [...] "doorways into the Gaian mind", suggesting that [...] "the planet has a kind of intelligence, it can actually open a channel of communication with an individual human being" [...] and that the psychedelic plants were the facilitators of this communication. In a more radical version of biophysicist Francis Crick's hypothesis of directed panspermia, McKenna speculated on the idea that psilocybin mushrooms may be a species of high intelligence, which may have arrived on this planet as spores migrating through space and which are attempting to establish a symbiotic relationship with human beings. He postulated that [...] "intelligence, not life, but intelligence may have come here [...] in this spore-bearing life form". He said, [...] "I think that theory will probably be vindicated. I <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hundred years if people do biology they will think it quite silly that people once thought that spores could not be blown from one star system to another by cosmic radiation pressure," [...] and also believed that [...] "few people {{are in a position to}} judge its extraterrestrial potential, because few people in the orthodox sciences have ever experienced the full spectrum of psychedelic effects that are unleashed." ...|$|E

25|$|According to Henry Krystal, {{individuals}} {{suffering from}} alexithymia <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> operative way and {{may appear to}} be superadjusted to reality. <b>In</b> psychotherapy, however, <b>a</b> cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, empathy, and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.|$|R
