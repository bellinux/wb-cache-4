2500|$|The {{combined}} Cassini–Huygens spacecraft {{was launched}} from Earth on October 15, 1997. Huygens {{separated from the}} Cassini orbiter on December 25, 2004, and landed on Titan on January 14, 2005 near the Xanadu region. [...] This is the only landing accomplished in the outer Solar System. It {{was also the first}} landing on a moon other <b>than</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> It touched down on land, although the possibility that it would touch down in an ocean was also taken into account in its design. The probe was designed to gather data for a few hours in the atmosphere, and possibly a short time at the surface. It continued to send data for about 90 minutes after touchdown. It remains the most distant landing of any human-made craft.|$|E

Perhaps {{it is time for}} us to die. If we resist, and try to cling to the fringes, as I have done so far, we are shaken off rudely, or allowed to hang on {{neglected}} and disowned.

2500|$|According to Schafer, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea for Full Throttle while {{listening}} to a traveller's tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. As he listened, it occurred to him that [...] "bikers are kind of like pirates — like another culture that people don't have a window into most of the time, but [...] has its own rules", and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. So he began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson's [...] The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn't get it to [...] "work out" [...] with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of Psychonauts. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of [...] "'We can't believe we paid you to write this.'" [...] "They hated it" [...] he stated. In an interview with Gamasutra, Shafer stated that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated the team was depending [...] "on the [...] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog..." [...] On the game's setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, however he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate <b>than</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> [...] "It was never meant to be post-war or anything like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|A few of {{the core}} {{characters}} from Chrono Cross originate from an earlier game titled Radical Dreamers. Chrono series writer Masato Kato felt that the first game in the series, Chrono Trigger, did not wrap up all its story arcs, and as such, wrote the story of Radical Dreamers to conclude some aspects of it. However, due to the rushed nature of the development schedule, it being a short, text based visual novel, and being released on an obscure add-on for the Super Famicom, the Satellaview, Kato would label the game [...] "unfinished", leading to the conception of a more complete game, which would be Chrono Cross. Serge, Kid, Lynx, Viper, Radius, and Riddel all originate from the game. Additionally, the Radical Dreamers character Magil, who is an amnesiac Magus from Chrono Trigger, was originally {{going to be the}} character Guile in Chrono Cross, before Kato wrote him out of the script, fearing he could not do the character justice in the massive scope of Chrono Cross. While Radical Dreamers characters were used as a base for the characters of Chrono Cross, Kato made changes as well. In Radical Dreamers, Serge acted as the game's narrator, rather than a silent protagonist, and Lynx, is just a regular human, rather than an anthropomorphic cat. With the release of Chrono Cross, the characters and events of Radical Dreamers were retconned as being from a similar but different alternate reality.Kid:...
