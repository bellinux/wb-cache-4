5|$|Yttrium has {{at least}} 20 {{metastable}} ("excited") isomers ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for 80Y and 97Y. While most of yttrium's isomers {{are expected to be}} less stable than <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> state, 78mY, 84mY, 85mY, 96mY, 98m1Y, 100mY, and 102mY have longer half-lives than <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than isomeric transition.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding off}} the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, {{followed}} by the right center.

5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E
5|$|Only {{the large}} Chian navy {{seems to have}} stood <b>their</b> <b>ground,</b> perhaps {{accompanied}} by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties. Eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away back to Chios, thereby ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and {{fled to the}} palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|At 6:49 pm fire crews {{waiting to}} connect to Phoenix {{reported}} she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions. Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole neighborhood was threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold <b>their</b> <b>ground,</b> that they would soon have more water.|$|E

5|$|At least 32 {{metastable}} isomers {{have been}} characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable {{of these is}} 192m2Ir, which decays by isomeric transition with a half-life of 241years, making it more stable than any of iridium's synthetic isotopes in <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> states. The least stable isomer is 190m3Ir with a half-life of only 2µs. The isotope 191Ir {{was the first one}} of any element to be shown to present a Mössbauer effect. This renders it useful for Mössbauer spectroscopy for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.|$|E
5|$|City were relegated again {{five seasons}} later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the 1928–29 season, they broke several club records to earn {{promotion}} back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they {{remained in the}} third and fourth tiers of the English football league system until 1985–86. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> suffered a disastrous fire in which 56people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating promotion.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E

5|$|In September, Serbian troops {{completely}} {{surrounded the}} city of Vukovar. Croatian troops, including the 204th Vukovar Brigade, entrenched themselves within the city and held <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> against elite armored and mechanized brigades of the JNA, as well as Serb paramilitary units. Vukovar was almost completely devastated; 15,000 houses were destroyed. Some ethnic Croatian civilians had taken shelter inside the city. Other members of the civilian population fled the area en masse. Death toll estimates for Vukovar {{as a result of}} the siege range from 1,798 to 5,000. A further 22,000 were exiled from Vukovar immediately after the town was captured.|$|E

The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April. The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold.|$|E

On 8 August, {{one of these}} (from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division) was attacking {{the rear of the}} two SS Panzer Divisions. Although fighting would continue around Mortain for several more days, there was no further prospect of any German success. The Germans issued orders to go on to the defensive along the entire front, but poorly communicated orders resulted in this being impossible to achieve, with some German forces retreating, and others preparing to hold <b>their</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

He helped Eastwood to a play-off position in 2010–11 with a fifth-place finish, although {{they were unable to}} play in them as <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> was not deemed good enough for the Conference Premier.

5|$|On 12–13 April 1916 near Beit Ayeesa, Mesopotamia, Naik Shahamad Khan was {{in charge}} of a machine-gun {{covering}} a gap in our new line within 150 yards of the entrenched enemy.

For three hours he held the gap under very heavy fire and when his gun was knocked out, he and his two belt-fillers held <b>their</b> <b>ground</b> with rifles until ordered to withdraw.

50|$|Over {{the winter}} in {{preparation}} for the 2009 Cricket Season both Lord's and The Oval also had permanent floodlights installed. Both these grounds have telescopic floodlights which can move upwards when required to light up the playing surface. Northamptonshire also installed permanent floodlights at <b>their</b> Wantage Road <b>ground</b> for the 2010 season. This took the total number of counties to have floodlights at <b>their</b> <b>grounds</b> to nine, exactly half of the 18 counties. Kent also installed permanent telescopic floodlights at <b>their</b> Canterbury <b>ground</b> in time for the 2011 cricket season. Durham and Yorkshire installed lights at the Riverside ground and Headingley for the 2015 seasonBoth Leicestershire at <b>their</b> Grace Road <b>ground</b> and Gloucestershire at <b>their</b> Nevil Road <b>ground</b> installed floodlights in time for the 2016 season. Both grounds used the lights for the first time for matches in the T20 Blast competition on Friday 20th May 2016. With Somerset also having received planning permission for floodlights to be installed at <b>their</b> Taunton <b>ground</b> this only leaves Worcestershire as the only county not to have permanent floodlights at <b>their</b> home <b>ground.</b>|$|R
