5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E
5|$|Thompson assumed {{office in}} a Upstate New York district. When Thompson took office in January 2007, he, along with Diane Savino and Jeffrey Klein (both of whom later {{defected}} from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> form {{the core of the}} Independent Democratic Conference), assumed the chairmanship of the New York Democratic Senate Campaign Committee by assuming control of Democratic campaigns development. He retained this position through the 2008 general election.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E
5|$|Kilroy became <b>the</b> first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} <b>the</b> {{district in}} 42 years (since Secrest). She is only <b>the</b> second <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent {{a significant portion}} of Columbus since 1967. <b>The</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent <b>the</b> city, Bob Shamansky, represented the neighboring 12th District from 1981 to 1983.|$|R
50|$|In 1852 Seymour sold <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> Adam Bellis, also {{a staunch}} Democrat.|$|R
50|$|Clinton was <b>the</b> first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win {{re-election}} to {{the presidency}} since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and <b>the</b> first Southern <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win re-election since Andrew Jackson in 1832.|$|R
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E
5|$|McClellan was {{nominated}} by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> run against Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 U.S. presidential election. Following {{the example of}} Winfield Scott, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation {{of the war and}} restoration of the Union (but not the abolition of slavery), but the party platform, written by Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, was opposed to this position. The platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party's choice for vice president, George H. Pendleton, a peace candidate from Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} {{was successful}} in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. Some lawmakers went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate {{the day before the}} balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E
50|$|It statewide {{races for}} {{governor}} and the U.S. Senate, the county has slowly trended Republican. <b>The</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>the</b> county in a gubernatorial race was Tony Sanchez in 2002, while Rick Noriega in 2008 is <b>the</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> carry it in a senatorial race.|$|R
50|$|Fourteen years later, in 1980, Shamansky {{challenged}} Devine again. This time, he {{was successful}} in unseating the long-time incumbent Devine, becoming <b>the</b> first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent <b>the</b> district since 1939. He was also <b>the</b> first <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> represent {{a significant portion of}} the state capital, Columbus, since 1967.|$|R
50|$|The swing was 4.8% from <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Conservatives.|$|R
5|$|The electoral {{majority}} that brought <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> power in 1951 combined organization Democrats with reform-minded independents. While successful {{in winning the}} election, the coalition started to fray soon after taking office. By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell {{just short of the}} two-thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. In doing so, Dallas worked against the wishes of Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green, Jr., siding instead with the reform-minded mayor, Joseph S. Clark, Jr.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised {{his analysis of the}} decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{investment in}} politics, the AFL-CIO had not succeeded in restoring <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> {{a majority in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. Some union presidents began to argue that the AFL-CIO should stop spending money on political causes and divert resources to organizing new members.|$|E

50|$|Saline County, {{like most}} of Kansas, is a Republican stronghold: <b>the</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win a {{majority}} in the county was Lyndon Johnson in 1964, who was also <b>the</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>the</b> stateâ€™s electoral votes. Saline has voted for the statewide winner in every presidential election since 1872, including for James Weaver in 1892.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, Audrey Griscom sold <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> Knight Newspapers, giving <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> {{its first}} {{corporate}} owner. Knight Newspapers built <b>the</b> <b>Democrat's</b> current plant,at 277 N. Magnolia Drive, in 1968, {{coinciding with the}} newspaper's switch from hot type to modern off-set printing. In 1974, Knight Newspapers merged with Ridder Publications to become Knight Ridder Inc. On Jan. 3,1978, <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> converted from an afternoon newspaper to a morning newspaper.|$|R
25|$|It's {{definitely}} {{worth it}} to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> put in the effort if only to keep the party energized. Even if Paul Hackett loses, {{it is very important}} for the party for him to do well. It could be seen as a sign of opportunities for Democrats in other GOP strongholds.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, {{the first}} {{cracks in the}} state Democratic Party began to show {{after the passage of}} the Kansas-Nebraska Act by Congress. Bright and his faction, a {{majority}} of the party, began forcing out anti-slavery members of the party leadership, using support of the act as a litmus test of party loyalty. By then the national debate over the possible break-up of the Union had begun. The Whig party was also on the brink of collapse, and a new coalition party of former Whigs, former Democrats, the anti-immigration Free Soil party, and the anti-slavery Liberty Party came together. The result was the so-called Know-Nothing Party and the first real challenge to Democrat control of the state in a generation. The 1854 mid-term election caused <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> lose seats in the Senate, but still maintain control. The Democrats did, however, lose their majority in the house. The House was spilt with no party attaining majority, and the Whigs caucused with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> control the assembly. The effect was a virtual paralysis to the legislature, and Wright was unable to make any significant accomplishments during his last two years in office.|$|E
25|$|During the 2002 Maryland {{governor}} election, Glendening was {{not eligible}} to run {{due to the}} state constitutional term limit. His lieutenant governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, was nominated by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> run. Townsend was damaged during the election due to wide criticism by rural voters, especially farmers, directed at Glendening for what they considered overzealous environmental legislation aimed at preventing rain runoff of pollutants from farm soils into tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, that significantly raised the cost of participating in agribusiness.|$|E

25|$|Initially, no {{prominent}} Democratic {{candidate was}} prepared to run against a sitting president of the Democratic Party. Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the New Hampshire primary, hoping to pressure <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} revelations, Texas A history {{professor}} Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned {{for the release}} of the information, argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, {{that the purpose of the}} break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats. Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of the New York Times, who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 mid-term elections, the Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate, and the Democrats retook the House after {{absorbing}} the remaining Whigs. The state still only had one US Senator, and the governor was hoping to have the assembly elect one, and nominate Jesse D. Bright {{to return to the}} Senate. The opposition was more hostile to Bright, primarily because of his actions regarding slavery. The Republicans were still angry over Willard's blocking their Senate pick, so the Senate decided to reciprocate his actions, refusing to enter the joint session necessary to elect a senator. Willard instructed <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> meet without the Republicans and elect a Senator anyway. The dubious legality of the issue was considered outrageous by the Republicans and raised the tension to a fever pitch.|$|E
50|$|Wyoming is a Republican bastion. <b>The</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win {{a senate}} {{election}} was Gale W. McGee in 1970. <b>The</b> last <b>Democrat</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> At large seat was Teno Roncalio in 1978. The last time <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> controlled <b>the</b> Wyoming House of Representatives was 1966. <b>The</b> last time <b>Democrats</b> controlled <b>the</b> Wyoming Senate was 1938. The state, however, did elect Democratic governors from 1974 to 2010 with only an eight-year interruption of Jim Geringer's tenure from 1995 too 2003.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, {{it would have been easy}} for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, the long-contemplated {{building}} of the north-south Delaware Railroad finally got underway. In the works since the company was chartered in 1836, funds were finally raised and a route laid out. Constitutional reform was also seriously considered at this time. By 1850, New Castle County had nearly half {{the population of the}} state, but only one third of the representation in the Delaware General Assembly. This and other populist measures led <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> call for a Constitutional Convention to address them. Using methods that were probably unconstitutional, the Democrats managed to get the Convention convened in December 1852, but the majority of the delegates were Whigs. After several months of negotiation, compromises were reached that satisfied no one and the whole effort was resoundingly rejected at the polls. The Constitution of 1831 would remain in effect.|$|E
25|$|Due to the party's {{numbers in}} the Senate, both Liberal and Labor governments {{required}} the assistance of <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>to</b> pass contentious legislation, most notably {{in the case of}} the Howard Government's goods and services tax (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as centrists, occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. The party had no single base, instead drawing on the support of a sometimes uneasy coalition of political moderates, disaffected major-party voters, civil libertarians, and social activists (including environmentalists and anti-war campaigners). Commonalities included an almost uniform social liberalism and an emphasis on participatory democracy. Within the parliamentary party there was frequent internal conflict, with several senators leaving the party at various stages to sit as independents or to join other parties. After Don Chipp's retirement in 1986, only one subsequent leader (Cheryl Kernot) served for more than four years.|$|E
