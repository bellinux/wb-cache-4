5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, {{which allow}} it to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> narrow alleyways common to the casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
5|$|Creeks <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on {{pedestrian}} paths linking {{various areas}} of campus. The footbridges {{make it possible}} to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations. At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.|$|E

5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> Ross Ice Shelf, the first to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E
5|$|The FAA instituted {{new rules}} for the Hudson River {{corridor}} beginning November 19, 2009, establishing three air traffic zones.

5|$|Traditionally in {{adventure}} game engines, non-player {{characters were}} static awaiting the player {{to interact with}} them to trigger an event. However, Virtual Theatre allowed non-player characters to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> world in seemingly random patterns, interacting with their environment. Upon the engine's first release, it rivaled competing engines such as LucasArts' SCUMM engine, and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E
5|$|Connections to San Francisco's local {{light rail}} system, the Muni Metro, are {{facilitated}} primarily through the twin-level Market Street subway. Plans from 1960 called for BART trains to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> Twin Peaks Tunnel, but {{the upper level}} of the subway {{was turned over to}} Muni and both agencies share the Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell and Civic Center stations. Some Muni Metro lines connect with (or pass nearby) the BART system at the Balboa Park and Glen Park stations.|$|E

5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and {{industry}} in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Gifu {{also served}} as the base for the {{creation}} of Japan's fire balloons. These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more airtight.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, plans arose {{to create a}} new highway link {{on the south side of}} Lake Simcoe to connect Highway400 and Highway12. The route for this {{extension}} was announced on June30, 1978. It was to follow 11th Line from Highway400 east to the Holland Marsh, where it would cross towards the northeast onto the alignment of Ravenshoe Road (York Road32). The extension would <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> length of Ravenshoe Road to Lakeridge Road (Durham Road23), where it would zig-zag onto Concession Road7 to end immediately north of Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Paton began {{construction}} of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton {{was put in charge}} of an economic survey of Syria which required him to <b>traverse</b> <b>the</b> country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the {{construction of}} a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Nyasaland.|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route.

Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E
