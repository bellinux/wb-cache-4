50|$|Studdable {{tires are}} {{manufactured}} with molded holes on the rubber tire tread. Typically, there are 80 to 100 molded holes per tire for stud insertion. The insertion {{is done by}} using a special tool that spreads the rubber hole so that a stud jacket can be inserted and the flange {{at the bottom of}} the jacket can be fitted nicely to the bottom of the hole. The metal studs come in specific heights to match the depths of the holes molded into the tire tread based on the <b>tread</b> <b>depths.</b> For this reason, stud metals can only be inserted when the tires have not been driven on. A proper stud insertion results in the metal jacket that is flush with the surface of the tire tread having only the pin part that protrudes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Prevention of {{slipping}} accidents requires {{provision of}} adequate friction {{through the use}} of suitable combinations of footwear and underfoot surfaces. Shoe sole tread groove is one of the important factors on friction coefficient during walking. Objective: To measure the effect of different shoe sole <b>tread</b> groove <b>depths</b> and different surfaces on the required quotient of friction (Q), heel strike velocity and occurrence time of ground reaction forces (GRF) in stance phase during walking on slippery and dry surfaces. Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 22 healthy men were studied under different conditions. The studied independent variables were shoe groove depths (included 1, 2. 5 and 5 mm) and type of walking surface (dry and slippery). Biomechanical gait analysis was carried out with 396 single steps. Data were collected by motion analysis system and two force platform. Results: The occurrence time of GRF was significantly faster on dry surface than slippery surface (p< 0. 01). Q was significantly lower on slippery surface and with groove depths of 1 and 2. 5 mm. The highest value of Q was observed with the deepest groove depth of 5 mm. Heel strike velocity did not differ significantly in the 6 conditions tested. Conclusion: <b>Tread</b> groove <b>depth</b> is a significant factor affecting the Q at the shoes-surface interface on dry and slippery floors. It seems that deeper groove is more appropriate for maintaining the stability during walking. The walking surface affects the occurrence time of GRF; the force components occur sooner on the dry than slippery surface. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Notice {{that the}} {{treadwear}} grade is a ratio {{and not a}} mileage. This is because multiple factors determine treadwear rates {{and most of them}} are a function of driving conditions and operating environment, and not the tire itself. As a result, actual tire wear will vary considerably within the same tire line. However, two tires with exactly the same compound should have a treadwear rating that varies in accordance with <b>tread</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tire {{maintenance}} for {{motor vehicles}} is based on several factors. The chief reason for tire replacement is friction from moving contact with road surfaces, causing the tread on the outer perimeter of tires to eventually wear away. When the <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> becomes too shallow (less than 0.125in./3.2mm), the tire is worn out and should be replaced. The same wheels can usually be used throughout the lifetime of the car. Other problems encountered in tire maintenance include: ...|$|E
5000|$|The slope or {{pitch of}} the stairs is the ratio between the rise and the going (not the <b>tread</b> <b>depth,</b> due to the nosing). It is {{sometimes}} called the rake of the stairs. The pitch line is the imaginary line along {{the tip of the}} nosing of the treads. In the UK, stair pitch is the angle the pitch line makes with the horizontal, measured in degrees. The value of the slope, as a ratio, is then the tangent of the pitch angle.|$|E
5000|$|Wear bars (or wear indicators) {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit.

50|$|Proper vehicle safety {{requires}} specific {{attention to}} inflation pressure, <b>tread</b> <b>depth,</b> and general {{condition of the}} tires. Over-inflated tires {{run the risk of}} explosive decompression (they may pop). On the other hand, under-inflated tires have a higher rolling resistance and suffer from overheating and rapid tread wear particularly on the edges of the tread. As tire tread decreases, there is more traction between the tire and the road resulting in better grip. However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet. Tires worn down past their safety margins and into the casing run the very real risk of rupturing. Also, certain combinations of cross ply and radial tires on different wheels of the same vehicle can lead to vehicle instability, and may also be illegal. Vehicle and tire manufacturers provide owners' manuals with instructions on how to check and maintain tires.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treadwear}} rating or treadwear {{grade is}} how long the tire manufacturers expect the tire to last. A Course Monitoring Tire (the standard tire that a test tire will be compared to) has a rating of [...] "100". If a manufacturer assigns a treadwear rating of 200 to a new tire, they are indicating that they expect the new tire to have a useful lifespan that is 200% {{of the life of}} a Course Monitoring Tire. The [...] "test tires" [...] are all manufacturer-dependent. Brand A's rating of 500 is not necessarily going to offer drivers the same mileage rating as Brand B's tire of the same rating. The testing is non-regulated and can vary greatly. Treadwear ratings are only useful for comparing Brand A's entire lineup against itself.Tread wear, also known as tire wear, is caused by friction between the tire and the road surface. Government legal standards prescribe the minimum allowable <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> for safe operation.|$|E
50|$|One highly {{important}} {{preventative measure}} in avoiding a flat {{is to ensure}} your spare tire is properly inflated and in good, undamaged condition. If the spare tire has an irregular sidewall (bumps, dents, or other deformities) the spare tire needs to be replaced. Also check for dry rot (which looks like small cracks in the sidewall) as well as good <b>tread</b> <b>depth.</b> New spare tires {{can be purchased at}} tire repair shops, automotive dealerships, even over the internet. If for any reason, the process of checking the inflation pressure of your spare is too arduous of a task for you to perform (on some vehicles this requires removing the spare tire if a full-size, could be very heavy or sliding underneath the vehicle on SUVs and pick-up trucks); when getting an oil change done or other routine maintenance one can (and should) request that the technician working on their car checks the spare tire pressure. If one chooses this route, it will help the technician if you remove items that may block access to the spare tire. Most auto technicians will only check the pressures of the tires already on the vehicle, and will ignore the spare tire unless one requests it be checked.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, many bicycle tyres {{made for}} street use are slick. Aquaplaning does not present {{a problem for}} {{bicycles}} due to their narrower width, higher pressure, lower speed, and circular cross section (due {{to the need to}} lean the bicycle in turns); the bicycle tyre can penetrate the water layer to contact the road much more easily. In practice, grooved bicycle tyres do not outperform slick tyres on wet roads. However, many low and medium performance bicycle tyres have substantial <b>tread</b> <b>depth,</b> because the bicycles are designed with off-road excursions in mind: in dirt, gravel or sand, the tread pattern provides significantly improved traction. In addition, high-performance bicycle tyres, although designed for road use only, often have a very fine tread pattern, which appears to provide no difference in performance versus a slick tyre and is only there for marketing purposes and as a tyre-wear indicator. This is clear not only from direct testing of tyres, but also {{from the fact that the}} texture of the road is itself coarser than the minimal tread pattern on these tyres. Some grooveless designs have small [...] "holes" [...] or dimples embedded in the tread as a tyre-wear indicator. This is similar to automobile tyre-wear indicator bars, which contact the road when the tyre is worn to a low tread amount, making the tyre noisy on the road.|$|E
5000|$|Variance on riser {{height and}} <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> between {{steps on the}} same flight should be very low. Building codes require variances no larger than 0.1875 in between depth of {{adjacent}} treads or the height of adjacent risers; within a flight, the tolerance between the largest and smallest riser or between the largest and smallest tread can not exceed 0.375 in. The reason is that on a continuous flight of stairs, people get used to a regular step and may trip {{if there is a}} step that is different, especially at night. The general rule is that all steps on the same flight must be identical. Hence, stairs are typically custom made to fit the particular floor to floor height and horizontal space available. Special care must be taken on the first and last risers. Stairs must be supported directly by the subfloor. If thick flooring (e.g. thick hardwood planks) are added on top of the subfloor, it will cover part of the first riser, reducing the effective height of the first step. Likewise at the top step, if the top riser simply reaches the subfloor and thick flooring is added, the last rise at the top may be higher than the last riser. The first and last riser heights of the rough stairs are modified to adjust for the addition of the finished floor.|$|E
50|$|Spiral stairs, {{sometimes}} referred to in architectural descriptions as vice, wind around a newel (also the central pole). They typically have a handrail on the outer side only, and {{on the inner side}} just the central pole. A squared spiral stair assumes a square stairwell and expands the steps and railing to a square, resulting in unequal steps (larger where they extend into a corner of the square). A pure spiral assumes a circular stairwell and the steps and handrail are equal and positioned screw-symmetrically. A tight spiral stair with a central pole is very space efficient in the use of floor area. Spiral stairs have the disadvantage of being very steep - only if they are tight or are otherwise not supported by a center column. This is because of two reasons. The wider the spiral, the more steps can be accommodated per spiral. Therefore, if the spiral is large in diameter, via having a central support column that is strong (invariably large in diameter) and a special handrail that helps distributes the load, each step may be longer and therefore the rise between each step may be smaller, (equal to that of regular steps.) Otherwise, the circumference of the circle at the walk line will be so small that it will be impossible to maintain a normal <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> and a normal rise height without compromising headroom before reaching the upper floor. To maintain headroom some spiral stairs have very high rises to support a very short diameter. These are typically cases where the stairwell must be a small diameter by design or must not have any center support by design or may not have any perimeter support. An example of perimeter support is the Vatican stairwell shown in the next section or the gothic stairwell shown to the left. That stairwell is only tight because of its design in which the diameter must be small. Many spirals, however, have sufficient width for normal size treads (8 inches) by being supported by any combination of a center pole, perimeter supports attaching to or beneath the treads, and a helical handrail. In this manner, the treads may be wide enough to accommodate low rises. The photo on the right are self-supporting stairs. This means the spiral needs to be necessarily steep to allow the weight to distribute safely down the spiral in the most vertical manner possible. Spiral steps with center columns or perimeter support do not have this limitation. Building codes may limit the use of spiral stairs to small areas or secondary usage if their treads are not sufficiently wide or have risers above 8 or 9 inches.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of load {{carrying}} methods, stair slopes and walking speeds on heart rate and walking postures. Nine participants climbed up and down stairs with various stair slopes (24 °, 30 ° and 36 °), walking speeds (72, 96, and 132 steps per minute), and using different load carrying methods (empty loads, backpack, and hand-held). The effects of these factors on heart rate, Borg-RPE and flexion angles of knee joints, hip joints and trunk angles were investigated. This study demonstrated that increased stair slopes and walking speed were associated with increased heart rate and RPE. The heart rate for empty loads subjects was lowest, followed by backpack load and hand-held load. Climbing stairs with larger inclination was associated with smaller knee joint flexion angle and larger trunk and hip joint flexion angle. In conclusion, it is easier for subjects to carry a load of the same weight up stairs by backpack than by hand. However, the stair slope should be less than 30 °.
