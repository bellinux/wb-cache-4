40|$|Correlations between {{body weight}} and {{measurements}} (body <b>length,</b> <b>thigh</b> circumference, shank <b>length</b> and chest width) at 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks {{of age in}} New Zealand White (NZW), Red Baladi (RB), Black Baladi (BB) breeds of rabbits were studied by factor analysis to disclose the main sources of shared variability, to deduce the factors that describe these characteristics and to quantify breed differences in morphometric size and shape variation during growth. Differences and similarities between NZW and Egyptian rabbit breeds in factors describing variations in size and shape characters are discussed. At marketing age, compared with local breeds (RB and BB), NZW had higher communality (proportion of variance for a variable that is shared in common by other variables) for chest width and lower communality for body weight and other body shape characters. Compared with NZW, Egyptian breeds varied more in size and less in shape characters. Finding indicated {{that most of the}} common variability in live performance traits could be accounted for by two factors with the influence of general factor preponderating. Irrespective of breed, the first factor at various ages was interpreted as a general size factor. The second factor varies with breed and stage of development. In NZW, this factor at all ages (6 to 12 weeks) was described as chest width factor. The second factor in RB was designated to chest width (at 6 and 8 weeks) and a shank length at 10 and 12 weeks. In BB, the second factor was designated to chest width (at 6 weeks), a shank length (at 8 and 10 weeks) and to thigh circumference (at 12 weeks). The importance of the general size factor in relation to the second factor (shape) changes with age. The contribution of the general size factor to the total variance decreased with age in both NZW and RB, but it showed irregular pattern in BB.

5000|$|For {{the first}} half of the 13th century, linen braies were worn and then {{shortened}} to the knee in the second half of the century, which then became drawers or undergarments. Short stockings ended just below the knee and the border was occasionally decorated. Longer stockings, mid <b>thigh</b> <b>length,</b> could also be worn and, as C. Cunnington depicts, were “shaped to fit the leg, widening above the knee so that they could be pulled up over the braies”. The stockings and girdle were tied together at a point in the top front of the stocking by which to keep it in place. Some stockings had stirrups, whole feet, or no feet. For hosiery, made of wool or leather, a “thin leather sole was attached” so that shoes would not need to be worn. [...] Leg wear during the 12th century tended to be brightly coloured and stripes were popular. All classes of men during the 12th century wore shoes or boots. Shoes, as C. Cunnington describes, were “open over the foot and fastened in front of the ankle with a strap secured by a brooch or buckle”. [...] For the wealthy, the bands on shoes were decorated and designs were often found “over the foot or around the heel”. Different styles of shoes began to appear during this era. One such, as C. Cunnington states, was “high around the ankle and slit down the sides or in front” while others were laced or had “short uppers but cut high behind the heel”. Boots were most notably mid calf or knee length and laced down the front or along the inner side. These boots tended to be brightly coloured and had, in C. Cunnington’s words, “turn over tops”. Shorter boots, with pointed toes, were also worn and ended just above the ankle. Boots were made of leather from a cow or ox, cloth, fish skin, or, for those who could afford it, silk. Separate hoods also made an appearance. They were loose with, as C. Cunnington describes, a “pointed cowl” and were attached to a robe stretching to the shoulders. The cape was usually a single piece of material and thus had to be put on over the head. C. Cunnington states that the “pointed Phrygian cap,” or the “small, round cap with stalk or with a rolled brim and with or without the stalk” or the “stalked soft cap, resembling a beret” were worn. Travelers wore “hats with large brims and low crowns…over the hood” which tied under the chin (. Small hats with round crowns and, C. Cunnington says, “turned-down brim, decorated with a knob instead of a stalk” were also worn, as were coifs, which was a “close fitting plain linen bonnet which covered the ears and confined the hair” and tied under the chin. The coif could be worn with other hats or hoods. Accessories for 12th century English men became more decorated. The girdle, mid century, became more elaborate in its ornamentation and in the latter half of the century, was, “tied like a sash in front with hanging ends” or, if “long and elaborate, was fastened with ornamental buckles” as C. Cunnington depicts. Wallets and purses, in the early half of the century, were hung from the girdle or the breech girdle and in the latter half were placed under the tunic, out of sight. During this era gloves became fashionable for the nobility, although they were seldom worn. Rings, brooches, buckles, clasps, and “ornamental fillets of gold and silver” C. Cunnington says were worn by the ruling classes. Wool, linen, and silk continued to be used, as was leather, which the peasants used for tunics and mantle and left the hair on facing outward. Garments were also embroidered during this era.|$|E

A total of 224 one day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly allocated to one of the 16 floor pens in a completely randomised design (four treatments, four replicate groups, 14 chicks in each group). Dietary treatments consisted of 4 different levels of propolis powder including zero (control), 500, 1500, 2000 ppm in the diet throughout the entire experimental period (42 days). The feed was offered ad libitum. All the chickens were grown up in the same environmental and management conditions. Body weight gain, food intake and feed conversion ratio were measured {{at the end of each}} period, also, the production index was calculated at 42 days of age.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} effectiveness of <b>thigh</b> <b>length</b> versus knee length antiembolism stockings {{for the prevention}} of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in surgical patients. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis using direct methods and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Previous systematic reviews and electronic databases were searched to February 2014 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>thigh</b> <b>length</b> or knee length antiembolism stockings in surgical patients. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The primary outcome was incidence of DVT. Analysis of the DVT data was performed using ORs along with 95 % CIs. The I(2) statistic was used to quantify statistical heterogeneity. RESULTS: 23 RCTs were included; there was substantial variation between the trials and many were poorly reported with an unclear risk of bias. Five RCTs directly comparing <b>thigh</b> <b>length</b> versus knee length stockings were pooled and the summary estimate of effect favouring <b>thigh</b> <b>length</b> stockings was not statistically significant (OR 1. 48, 95 % CI 0. 80 to 2. 73). 13 RCTs were included in the network meta-analysis; <b>thigh</b> <b>length</b> stockings with pharmacological prophylaxis were more effective than knee length stockings with pharmacological prophylaxis, but again results were not statistically significant (OR 1. 76, 95 % credible intervals 0. 82 to 3. 53).

Some reported effects of SPA pretreatment on septic shock in mouse models but there is no study which reports the role of SPA pretreatment on the infected incision. Methods: According to count results, bacterial suspension was set at a density of ∼ 1. 8  ×  109 colony forming units/mL. BALB/c mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection with pentobarbital sodium. A longitudinal skin incision was made on the medial side of the right <b>thigh.</b> The <b>length</b> of the incision was 5  mm, and the depth was ∼ 3  mm. The bacterial suspension was gradually dripped and embrocated onto the incision surface to make the wound infection model. Before making the wound infection model for 48  hours and 24  hours, mice were retreated with SPA via intraperitoneal injection. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with SPA 1  mg/kg and the control group was injected with sterile saline to evaluate the biological safety of the best pretreatment dose. Results: A 1 -mL bacterial suspension can be utilized to make the wound infection model of BALB/c mouse lower limb. SPA pretreatment can reduce the inflammatory reactions in wound methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection mouse model and the best pretreatment dose is 1  mg/kg. Intraperitoneal injection 1  mg/kg SPA does not destroy the functions of the organs. A 1 -mg/kg SPA pretreatment can also reduce the inflammatory reactions in wound various bacterial infection mouse models.

Simple and accurate methods to estimate lower limbs LST {{are often used}} in attempts to partition out the influence of body size on performance outputs. The aim {{of the current study}} was to develop and cross-validate a new model to predict lower limbs LST in boys aged 10 - 13 years, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference method. Total body and segmental (lower limbs) composition were assessed with a Hologic Explorer-W QDR DXA scanner in a cross-sectional sample of 75 Portuguese boys (144. 8 +/- 6. 4 cm; 40. 2 +/- 9. 0 kg). Skinfolds were measured at the anterior and posterior mid-thigh, and medial calf. Circumferences were measured at the proximal, mid and distal <b>thigh.</b> Leg <b>length</b> was estimated as stature minus sitting height. Current stature expressed as a percentage of attained predicted mature stature (PMS) was used as an estimate of biological maturity status. Backward proportional allometric models were used to identify the model with the best statistical fit: ln (lower limbs LST) = 0. 838 x ln (body mass) + 0. 476 x ln (leg length) - 0. 135 x ln (mid-thigh circumference) - 0. 053 x ln (anterior mid-thigh skinfold) - 0. 098 x ln (medial calf skinfold) - 2. 680 + 0. 010 x (percentage of attained PMS) (R = 0. 95). The obtained equation was cross-validated using the predicted residuals sum of squares statistics (PRESS) method (R- 2 (PRESS) = 0. 90). Deming repression analysis between predicted and current lower limbs LST showed a standard error of estimation of 0. 52 kg (95 % limits of agreement: 0. 77 to - 1. 27 kg). The new model accurately predicts lower limbs LST in circumpubertal boys...|$|R
