2500|$|Cantinieau {{went to the}} Société Matra {{to build}} a two seat development, the MC-101. [...] This was also an open steel tube design, more complex {{particularly}} in the tail boom, though the undercarriage was reduced to simple skids [...] apart. [...] It had a [...] Hirth HM-504 engine, enclosed in a long, smooth nosed but partially open sided cowling, driving the oscillating rotor hub via a 41:6 reduction gearbox, clutch and Paulstra universal joint. The rotor blades were machined from duralumin. A three blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was <b>driven</b> via another Paulstra joint and cardan shaft.|$|R

50|$|The TSB {{issued an}} update on the {{investigation}} on 18 June 2009, indicating that the pilot may have been trying to perform a controlled landing {{at the time of the}} accident. The main blades were apparently rotating at the time of impact; however, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> gears were severely damaged, which would result in a loss of thrust. An engine shutdown was initiated at an altitude of 500 ft, consistent with a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> failure. The TSB was continuing to investigate the failure of the flotation system, which reportedly had been activated but did not operate correctly.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of mutual, destructive {{impact of the}} worn upper bearing of the WR- 24 transmission on the Mi- 24 helicopter's gearbox was stated. The Mi- 24 is the only helicopter operated in Poland, in which the gearbox is mounted outside the main transmission – in {{the centre of the}} transmission shaft, between the main gearbox and the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Damage to the gears in the gearbox of power generators is equivalent to termination of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor's</b> <b>drive.</b> Such a termination immediately causes rotation of the body in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the main rotor. It is associated with the loss of lift and steering. It may lead to a disaster. Such an incident occurred in January 2011 in Afghanistan – both authors participated in its investigation. The authors, taking into account very good, almost legendary combat properties of the Mi- 24, and their research of the specifics of wear and tear of the transmission elements, they think that, first, funds for development and implementation of the drive unit monitoring system should be made available specially for this helicopter. For this purpose, the authors propose to use the FAM-C method. It is characterised with significant ergonomics. Thank to this, multiple kinematic pairs can be observed simultaneously, and, therefore, the relationships between them as well...|$|R
50|$|At {{the instant}} of engine failure, the main rotor blades are {{producing}} lift and thrust from their {{angle of attack}} and velocity. By immediately lowering collective pitch, which must be done {{in case of an}} engine failure, the pilot reduces lift and drag and the helicopter begins an immediate descent, producing an upward flow of air through the rotor system. This upward flow of air through the rotor provides sufficient thrust to maintain rotor rotational speed throughout the descent. Since the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is <b>driven</b> by the main rotor transmission during autorotation, heading control is maintained as in normal flight.|$|R
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main <b>rotor</b> blades, <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is <b>driven</b> from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed approximately six times that of the main <b>rotor</b> to increase <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} a mix of aluminum and steel tubing. Its 22.0 ft diameter two-bladed rotor has a chord of 8 in and employs a NACA 0012 airfoil. The drive train consists of a primary belt drive connected to a geared transmission built with Volkswagen gears and a belt-driven <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive.</b> The tail rotor has a diameter of 40 in and a chord of 3.5 in.|$|E
50|$|Helicopters play an {{important}} role in enabling the military and law enforcement agencies to conduct special operations behind the enemy line or to carry out humanitarian and relief options. But the threat landscape In these helicopters operate in makes them an easy target for the enemy force or militants. For airborne platforms the threats are not from small arms but from MMG’s, LMG’s and anti-aircraft guns, to name a few. Smart gunners don’t aim to hit a rotary wing aircraft just about anywhere; instead they would aim for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft or the engine itself, rendering the aircraft un-maneuverable and leading to a crash landing thereby seriously injuring the occupants or more so causing inevitable fatalities. Hence aircraft are armoured not only to protect the fuselage but also the tail boom housing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft and engines too. On the other hand combat ready fixed wing aircraft move at such high speeds that they are not an easy target moreover the weight of armouring would severely impede their functionality thus purpose.|$|E
50|$|The 2006-built Sikorsky S-92A, with manufacturers' {{serial number}} 920048, was a 19-passenger {{helicopter}} powered by twin General Electric CT7 turboshaft engines. It has been registered C-GZCH to Cougar International Inc. since 12 April 2007. The main gearbox, which was reported as having lost oil pressure, couples both engines {{to the main}} and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors,</b> and also <b>drives</b> the hydraulic pumps and two electrical generators.|$|R
2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed semi-rigid, teetering {{rotor system}} is being {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, hingeless, bearingless composite rotor system. The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The rotor system has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and <b>drive</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{investigation}} into the crash started the same night as the accident. The flight data recorders were recovered on 17 January 2007 after severe weather hampered earlier recovery attempts. The storms also hampered efforts to find and recover those lost in the incident. Because offshore helicopter operations are so crucial to the day-to-day running of offshore platforms, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) {{felt it necessary to}} release a preliminary bulletin as soon as possible. Special Bulletin S1/2007 stated: [...] "The conclusion of this preliminary examination is that there are no signs of pre-impact malfunction of any major mechanical components, including the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and its <b>drive</b> shaft." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> system {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the tail rotor and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the tail rotor, measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The tail rotor pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the tail rotor in forward flight. The tail rotor pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the tail rotor or the tail rotor flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the tail rotor.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 December 2009, a Mi-24 of the Sri Lankan Air Force {{crashed in}} the Buttala area {{due to a}} {{technical}} failure. It has been found later that a [...] "power generator failure" [...] warning in the cockpit persuaded pilots to perform protective actions which eventually lead to reducing speed. The actual problem was {{a failure of the}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft which was also connected to the power generator and caused the warning. Without tail rotor support, it went out of control and crashed in to the jungle. The crew of two pilots and two gunners were killed.|$|E
40|$|Helicopters {{are complex}} and {{expensive}} aircraft {{with a level of}} technology that is immature compared to fixed- wing counterparts. Helicopters suffer from vibratory loads stemming from the main rotor and exhibit control and stability problems in the low-speed flight regime. Operating a helicopter near the limits of its flight envelope may result in unacceptable high structural loads which adversely affects wear and tear of drive train components. Conservative safety regulations lead to high operating cost where a significant part can be attributed to maintenance. Manufacturers and operators therefore strive to make helicopters more capable and reliable in an effort to reduce operating cost. Structural load alleviation offers an attractive option to achieve this goal by reducing component damage accumulation and subsequent required maintenance. This thesis investigates structural load alleviation in the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train of the UH- 60 Black Hawk. The Black Hawk provides a compelling case for load alleviation research because of its ever growing operational weight and resulting increase of drive train load levels. Furthermore, the lifetime of the UH- 60 is to be extended so that it will fly for many years to come. Current research and applications of rotorcraft structural load alleviation focus on the main rotor but less attention is given to <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train components. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating manoeuvres that result in critical dynamic loads in the UH- 60 <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train. A survey of pertinent literature and interviews with helicopter pilots indicate that pedal inputs for left-hand turns in hover lead to high dynamic loads in the UH- 60 <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train. A flight simulation model is constructed that offers the novel capability to predict dynamic loads in <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shafts. This model consists of an available high fidelity engine model and existing rotor models coupled by a multi body dynamics <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train model with properties that are based on component measurements and CAD drawings. Experiments are conducted to determine the relation between manoeuvre aggressiveness and dynamic loads in <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shafts. Based on the results a manoeuvre load alleviation control strategy is devised to reduce dynamic loads while ensuring applicable Level 1 handling quality requirements. Application of this control strategy will decrease dynamic loads during left-hand yaw manoeuvres in hover. Furthermore, the results highlight what reduction in loads can be achieved for varying levels of manoeuvre aggressiveness. These findings may aid in the design of flight control systems that incorporate <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train load alleviation objectives...|$|E
25|$|In the Scout and Wasp {{the main}} <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> {{is taken from}} the front of the gearbox and is {{transmitted}} beneath the gas generator via a flexible coupling, while the <b>drive</b> for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is taken from the rear of the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|First, {{there is}} no <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the main rotors are contra-rotating. Yaw is {{controlled}} by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> transmission.

40|$|The REDT (Rotor à Entraînement Direct par Turbine – Direct Turbine <b>Driven</b> <b>Rotor)</b> is a {{new concept}} for {{helicopter}} <b>rotor</b> <b>drives</b> developed by Sagita in Belgium. It works without any mechanical link between the engine {{on one side and}} the <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> on the other side. It uses a fuselage-mounted compressor that powers two contra-rotating rotor-mounted free turbines. These free turbines drive a pair of contrarotating rotors that are fitted with rigid hingeless main rotor blades. This novel <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> eliminates the need for either mechanical transmission or a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> The aim of the REDT concept is to lower the maintenance costs and the accident rate, as well as to extend the flight envelope towards much higher airspeeds compared to classical helicopters...|$|R

40|$|With the {{objective}} {{to secure the}} future of the helicopter in times of strongly growing fuel prices, a hybrid drive system is proposed, consisting of Diesel engines, generators and electric engines, replacing turbines, gear boxes and the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train. Instead the electric-engines will drive the main and tail rotor and will thereby allow new degrees of freedom in design and operation. The hybridisation has become attractive by the appearance of advanced high torque, low weight electric motors, high power density batteries and new efficient Diesel engines. The advantages of such systems become visible mainly for missions with moderate TOW or over long distances, since here the beneficial effects of rpm reduction and lower fuel burn dominate...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{lubrication}} {{tests were}} run with OH- 58 A helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft bearings. The tests were run in an outdoor environment with ambient temperatures ranging from 10 to 75 F. Dust was periodically {{applied to the}} bearings to simulate field conditions. The cause of bearing failure was associated with dust penetration. Rotor shaft failure {{was found to be}} caused by the shaft rotating in the standard rubber collar due to seizure of the bearings. Bearings with a positive rubbing seal having a MIL-G- 81322 grease produced lives greater than with bearings having labyrinth seals and a mineral oil paste lubricant. An elongated collar prevented failure of the rotor shaft during bearing seizure. In a limited test, installation of tail boom shrouds over the bearings which excluded dust and water resulted in bearing lives in excess of 1800 hours or 1200 hours greater than the current 600 hours TBO, regardless of the lubricant-bearing combination used...|$|E
5000|$|For {{vertical}} take-off, hovering, low-speed flight, {{and vertical}} landing, the main <b>rotor</b> wing was <b>driven</b> by tip jets, by directing the exhaust from a jet engine through thrust nozzles in the rotor tips. Because the <b>rotor</b> is <b>driven</b> directly by jet thrust, {{there is no}} need for a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to control torque as in a conventional helicopter.|$|R
50|$|Helicopters with teetering rotors—for {{example the}} two-blade {{system on the}} Bell, Robinson and others—must not be {{subjected}} to a low-g condition because such rotor systems do not control the fuselage attitude. This can result in the fuselage assuming an attitude controlled by momentum and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust that causes the tail boom to intersect the main rotor tip-path plane or result in the blade roots contacting the main <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, causing the blades to separate from the hub (mast bumping).|$|R
50|$|The {{propulsion}} system was unusual. Two General Electric J35 turbojet engines were used, sending bleed air {{up through the}} rotor hub. The blades were hollow, and the hot compressed air traveled through the blades to tip jets where fuel was injected. In flight, the rotors spun at a sedate 88 rpm. Since the <b>rotor</b> was <b>driven</b> at the tips rather than the hub, little torque compensation was required. Thus, the XH-17 had a very small <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> compared to its main <b>rotor.</b> This <b>drive</b> system was inefficient, limiting the test aircraft {{to a range of}} only 40 mi.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the third phase}} of work, the objective of which was to overcome the excessive brittleness of the previously developed UH- 1 helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shaft design which demonstrated a shaft train weight savings of 53. 1 % over the current 2024 -T 3 aluminum shaft train. A materials impact program demonstrated exceptionally noteworthy performance of two woven constructions containing E-glass and PRD 49 -III (designation later changed to KEVLAR 49) fibers in an epoxy resin matrix. Thermoplastic matrices and PRD 49 -III fiber provided impact resistance at low weight which was superior to composites having the same fiber in a thermoset resin matrix. A design, fabrication, and test program showed that shaft impact resistance could be improved over the previously developed graphite composite design at a cost in shaft train rate savings. The shaft train weight savings of the most impact tolerant construction was 4. 0 % over the current aluminum shaft train. Alternating plies of graphite and glass appear to provide substantially greater tube impact durability than that provided by hybridization of the two fibers into one tape wound to a ply design equivalent in strength and stiffness {{to that of the}} alternating ply design. Recommendations were made to continue research work to exploit the potential for more impact-durable structures through the use of KEVLAR 49 fiber, woven structures, thermoplastic matrices and THORNEL 50 -S/KEVLAR 49 blends with thermoset matrices...|$|E
40|$|The use of autonomous/Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) in {{variety of}} {{applications}} has been {{increased over the}} last decade. The UAVs are usually classified into two types: fixed wing and rotary wing. The autonomous helicopters are more versatile than the autonomous aeroplanes. They can perform wide range of manoeuvres compare to the aeroplanes, specifically {{they are capable of}} Vertically Taking Off and Landing (VTOL). Due to its high manoeuvrability, it has been used in various applications: agricultural crop dusting, search and rescue missions, inspection of bridges and power lines and surveillance of areas. Though they exhibit higher degree of applicability, they are vulnerable to faults and failures. An autonomous helicopter is naturally highly unstable vehicle and hard to control, specifically during faults/failures. So it is essential to ensure they are fault tolerant to fly safely during failures. The tail rotor failures are the failures that occur most frequently causing accidents in conventional single main rotor and tail rotor helicopters. In general, the tail rotor failures are classified into two types: Tail Rotor Control Failure (TRCF) and <b>Tail</b> <b>Rotor</b> <b>Drive</b> Failure (TRDF). During TRCF, the control over the tail rotor thrust is lost so it cannot be varied by the pilot or the operator and usually described as frozen control state. Where in TRDF condition the tail rotor stops spinning completely due to broken drive shaft ending up with no anti torque to counteract the main rotor torque. In this thesis, the possible TRCFs in small helicopters are investigated and fault tolerant controllers are developed based on various control schemes: PID, fuzzy-PID, LQR, H∞, and μ-synthesis to fly a small unmanned helicopter with TRCF in three different flight modes: hover, descent and forward flight. The developed controllers are tested with linear and nonlinear models and the simulation results are presented. The control of the helicopter with failure in forward flight is comparatively easier than at hover and in descent. The designed controllers are able to perform hover with minimal yaw variation in the event of failure. The proposed novel control scheme based on lateral/yaw augmented structure to utilize the lateral velocity induced yaw control during failure at hover and in forward flight is successfully implemented. A propulsion based FTC control scheme is developed using variable rotor speed as an additional control input to perform descent with failure. The fuzzy logic based controller is designed incorporating the general responses of a manned helicopter to throttle inputs given by a pilot in emergency situations. The developed controller has successfully performed the vertical descent with minimal variations in angular rates and translational velocities. The vehicle is successfully landed with very low impact energy as if it is a fault-free fully controlled descent...|$|E
40|$|Variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{speed is}} {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> In hover, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Reducing the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is ineffective for power reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R
