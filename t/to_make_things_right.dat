50|$|When {{everything}} you believed in for {{your entire life}} {{turns out to be}} a devastating lie, then will you direct your anger at the person who caused it all or forgive that person? This drama tells a story about people who are hell-bent on recovering what they think is rightfully theirs while on the opposite side, there are people who will fight to protect what belongs to them. In the beginning, the two sides hate each other's guts. They do despicable <b>things</b> that will <b>make</b> it impossible <b>to</b> ever <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>right</b> again.

The pent-up anger within themselves softens and they begin a path of rehabilitation and redemption that will allow them to forgive their enemies and bury the hatchet. This drama is not a story about revenge and anguish but a story of rehabilitation and harmony. Viewers will empathize with their agony and pain while also rejoicing at their happiness. The takeaway from it all is that love is a powerful force that can conquer all.|$|R

30|$|This text {{provided}} an overview for ethics in the sustainable fashion field. It was grounded on environmental ethics and value discussion in it. As Ehrenfeld (2015, 61, based on Rittel and Webber 1973) argues ‚Äòsolutions for wicked {{problems are not}} true-or-false but good-or-bad‚Äô, which grounds the discussion in sustainable design on ethics, moral and values. Moreover, {{he points out that}} each ‚Äòimplemented solution to a wicked problem has consequences‚Äô. Sustainable fashion is a wicked problem: there is no simple truth how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> better or <b>right,</b> but only different approaches to improve the current situation. Values and ethics are fundamental grounds also for sustainable fashion, and they might help to widen the discussion and seeing problem areas more holistically and further to include the ethical dimension more tightly to discussion. Ethics is the ground for making choices in the sustainable design and manufacturing and even while considering the business models and profit-making options. It is worthwhile to investigate the value base in sustainable fashion and further to consider the consequences of our design and industrial manufacturing processes for the environment, human health and for societies.|$|R
60|$|I {{protested that}} no bones were broken; but {{he moved with}} me to my own door, {{his hand on my}} shoulder, kindly feeling for a fracture; and on hearing that I had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my {{threshold}} and just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks had represented. It was plain he really feared I was hurt, and the sense of his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me. My cheap review fluttered off into space, and the best things I had said in it became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there. I can see him there still, on my rug, in the firelight and his spotted jacket, his fine, clear face all bright with the desire to be tender to my youth. I don't know what he had at first meant to say, but I think the sight of my relief touched him, excited him, brought up words to his lips from far within. It was so these words presently conveyed to me something that, as I afterwards knew, he had never uttered to any one. I have always done justice to the generous impulse that made him speak; it was simply compunction for a snub unconsciously administered to a man of letters in a position inferior to his own, a man of letters moreover in the very act of praising him. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> the <b>thing</b> <b>right</b> he talked to me exactly as an equal and on the ground of what we both loved best. The hour, the place, the unexpectedness deepened the impression: he couldn't have done anything more exquisitely successful.|$|R

He is very fond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is hampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money to spare--hardly enough to use; and that has led him into card-playing--Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for money, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a little beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet, with all that, looking at him as a whole, I think {{he is one of the}} most blameless men I ever knew.
