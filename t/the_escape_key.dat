50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>key's</b> {{creation}} is credited to Bob Bemer, {{a computer programmer}} who worked for IBM. He created the key in 1960 to allow programmers working with diverse machines to switch from one type of code to another. The name of the equivalent key on some early Teletype Model 33 keyboards was labeled Alt Mode..., the alternative mode of operation causing the escapement to treat the following one character in a special way. Much later printers and computer terminals that would use escape sequences often {{would take more than}} one following byte as part of a special sequence.|$|R

5000|$|Nightlong is {{predominantly}} an inventory management type of game, {{with a few}} puzzles thrown in. The game has backgrounds {{that appear to be}} a mixture of texture-mapped and hand-drawn graphics. The game is played mostly from the third-person perspective, and game characters are cyberpuppets. Background music and sound effects are unobtrusive. The navigation interface uses left-click to examine an object, right-click to use, interact with or combine objects in the game or in inventory. Hotspots are indicated with on-screen text. Many of the game's plot elements rely on finding a single object. For this amount of pixel hunting, a large-screen monitor is recommended. An inventory bar is accessible {{at the bottom of the}} screen, and <b>the</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>key</b> is used for the game control menu. <b>The</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>key</b> can also be used to skip video and dialog sequences, and right-clicking on screen exits avoids waiting for character walking. Useful [...] "Go to..." [...] text indicates previously-unexplored exits. A handy instant-navigation feature is also available for part of the game.|$|E

In a manner that resembles the childhood game of musical chairs, many prey species rapidly retreat to shared, unguarded refuges whenever a predator threatens, and only when refuges are relatively abundant do all prey individuals actually <b>escape.</b> <b>The</b> <b>key</b> feature of this process is that the per capita prey mortality rate depends on the ratio of prey individuals to refuges.

50|$|The Key {{appeared}} to die six years later. He wires {{an entire city}} block of St. Louis, Missouri, with bombs, forcing the Justice League to pass {{through a series of}} traps to reach the device which will stop the detonation. The Key reveals that he was freed by a judge who found Superman's actions an unconstitutional use of cruel and unusual punishment. Incarcerated in a regular prison, he learns the psychoactive drugs he has taken have left him mere months to live. Released on humanitarian grounds, he attempts to destroy the League. The Phantom Stranger impersonates one of the Key-Men, helping to save the League. Green Lantern John Stewart uses his power ring to drive the explosive force of the bombs down into the ground, and <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>escapes</b> at <b>the</b> last moment.|$|R

50|$|Most players say {{vehicles}} are best controlled {{using a computer}} steering wheel, although a joystick or even keyboard can be used. The keyboard is also used for some actions, like requesting pit service and adjusting brake bias. This is analogous to buttons on modern racing car steering wheels, and most computer wheels have buttons that can be mapped to keystrokes. The player can jump directly from the racetrack to the control interface by pressing <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> <b>key</b> (ESC), or entering their pit box.|$|E
40|$|Atmosphere <b>escape</b> is one <b>key</b> process {{controlling}} {{the evolution of}} planets.

50|$|The game is {{composed}} of five levels. Many players never completed the second one (which had a very difficult ending), {{and most of the}} rest never went past level three. When Team17 realized this, they released Project-X SE, a special edition with the difficulty toned down. It was released as a budget game. A hack for the original game to enable the player to skip levels by holding down the fire button and pressing <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> <b>key</b> was also distributed on the coverdisks of several Amiga magazines.|$|E
5000|$|Modal {{controls}} are best placed where {{the focus is}} in the task flow. [...] For example, a modal window can be placed next to the graphical control element that triggers its activation.

After completing the task for which the mode was activated, or after a cancel action such as <b>the</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>key,</b> returning to the previous state when a mode is dismissed will reduce the negative impact.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM PC layout, {{particularly}} the Model M, {{has been extremely}} influential, and today most keyboards use some variant of it. This has caused problems for applications developed with alternative layouts, which require keys that are in awkward positions on the Model M layout - often requiring the pinkie to operate - and thus require remapping for comfortable use. One notable example is <b>the</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>key,</b> used by the vi editor: on the ADM-3A terminal this was located where the Tab key is on the IBM PC, but on the IBM PC <b>the</b> <b>Escape</b> <b>key</b> is in the corner; this is typically solved by remapping Caps Lock to Escape. Another example is the Emacs editor, which makes extensive use of modifier keys, and uses the Control key more than the Meta key (IBM PC instead has the Alt key) - these date to the Knight keyboard, which had the Control key {{on the inside of}} the Meta key, opposite to the Model M, where it is on the outside of the Alt key; and to the space-cadet keyboard, where the four bucky bit keys (Control, Meta, Super, Hyper) are in a row, allowing easy chording to press several, unlike on the Model M layout. This results in the [...] "Emacs pinky" [...] problem.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Ryan Key {{lying on his}} bed in an apartment. Suddenly, he gets {{swallowed}} by the bedsheets (this is where the track starts to play).

Hiding in <b>the</b> bathroom, <b>Key</b> <b>escapes</b> through a window, where he ends up on a neighborhood street. Someone dressed in dark clothing gestures to offer him a drink, when Key notices he is in a bar filled with Asian people. During part of the video, it features the band performing in front of a crowd wearing suits. The chase continues through a hallway, underwater, to a hospital bed, and back. The video is based in a scene of the 1999 film Being John Malkovich, where Cameron Diaz chases Catherine Keener within the subconscious of Malkovich.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the solar wind interaction with the Martian upper atmosphere is presented. Three global models: the 3 ‐D Mars multifluid Block Adaptive Tree Solar‐wind Roe Upwind Scheme MHD code (MF‐MHD), the 3 ‐D Mars Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (M‐GITM), and the Mars exosphere Monte Carlo model Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (M‐AMPS) were used in this study. These models are one‐way coupled; i. e., the MF‐MHD model uses the 3 ‐D neutral inputs from M‐GITM and the 3 ‐D hot oxygen corona distribution from M‐AMPS. By adopting this one‐way coupling approach, the Martian upper atmosphere ion escape rates are investigated in detail with the combined variations of crustal field orientation, solar cycle, and Martian seasonal conditions. <b>The</b> calculated ion <b>escape</b> rates are compared with Mars Express observational data and show reasonable agreement. The variations in solar cycles and seasons can affect the ion loss {{by a factor of}} ∼ 3. 3 and ∼ 1. 3, respectively. The crustal magnetic field has a shielding effect to protect Mars from solar wind interaction, and this effect is the strongest for perihelion conditions, with the crustal field facing the Sun. Furthermore, the fraction of cold escaping heavy ionospheric molecular ions [(2 + and/or 2 +) /Total] are inversely proportional to the fraction of <b>the</b> <b>escaping</b> (ionospheric and corona) atomic ion [O+/Total], whereas 2 + and 2 + ion escape fractions show a positive linear correlation since both ion species are ionospheric ions that follow <b>the</b> same <b>escaping</b> path. <b>Key</b> PointsStudy crustal field, solar cycle, and seasons on Mars' upper atmosphere ion escapeTo understand the long‐term evolution of Mars atmosphere over its historyTo support MAVEN spacecraft mission data analysis (2014 – 2016...|$|R
