25|$|A {{publicist}} by profession, {{famed for}} inventing {{some of the}} most ingenious advertising slogans of his time, O’Neill was unusually adept at manipulating words and using them in an efficacious manner, but he refused to put <b>that</b> <b>talent</b> at the service of a lyrically lofty, feel-good sort of poetry (see ‘Simply Expressive’). Stridently anti-Romantic, concerned to keep humanity in its place as just one of earth’s species, he did not believe that an especially harmonious world was possible, and he abhorred all attempts to escape the world, whether through mystical or poetical exaltations. His one hope, or consolation, explicitly stated in ‘St. Francis’s Empty Sandal’, was in the connection (never entirely peaceful) he felt {{with other members of the}} species.|$|E

Dyess-Nugent praised Rosenbaum's acting, arguing that it shook [...] "the show awake, sending the needle hurtling rudely into the red zone". He ultimately stated that Rosenbaum's acting—in both the finale and the series as a whole—was [...] "one of the great TV series performances of the past 10 years and proof once again <b>that</b> <b>talent</b> will blossom in the least expected places".|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Johnson began his {{recording}} career, {{he was a}} well-known evangelist with a [...] "remarkable technique and {{a wide range of}} songs", as noted by the blues historian Paul Oliver. On December 3, 1927, Johnson was assembled along with Billiken Johnson and Coley Jones at a temporary studio <b>that</b> <b>talent</b> scout Frank Buckley Walker had set up in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Dallas to record for Columbia Records. In the ensuing session, Johnson played six selections, 13 takes in total, and was accompanied by Willie B. Harris on his first recording, [...] "I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole". Among the other songs Johnson recorded in Dallas were [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", [...] "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine", [...] "Mother's Children Have a Hard Time", [...] "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground", and [...] "If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down".

I'm still struggling to try and capture <b>that</b> <b>talent</b> on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who can literally do anything. If you watch this thing, he's doing nunchuck tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements." ...|$|E

We have to question this claim.

2500|$|Naïve art first {{appeared}} in Croatia {{at the beginning of}} the 1930s when the Zagreb Art Pavilion showcased an exhibition of the artists' association entitled Country (Zemlja) on 13 September 1931. Of the artists exhibited, two particularly stood out: Ivan Generalić, who showed three drawings and nine watercolors, and Franjo Mraz, who exhibited three watercolors. The artists sought to show <b>that</b> <b>talent</b> does not only reside in certain social classes or privilege and started the association with naïve art and paintings of villages or by artists from the countryside rather than cities. Themes in Croatian naïve art branched out in the 1950s from villages to [...] "personal classics," [...] which included architectural monuments and objects and opened a period known as [...] "modern primitive art." ...|$|E

[...] USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and Mike Clark wrote, [...] "Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979's A Little Romance." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all <b>that</b> <b>talent</b> wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Unfaithful shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be.

[...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for The New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Ultimately Unfaithful is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it on that level, even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there's almost no humor," [...] and concluded that it was [...] "one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups." ...|$|E
