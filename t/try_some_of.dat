Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to <b>try</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E

25|$|Now when ye meet {{in battle}} those who disbelieve, {{then it is}} smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and {{afterward}} either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens.

500|$|Lou Lombardo, having {{previously}} worked with Peckinpah on Noon Wine, was personally {{hired by the}} director to edit The Wild Bunch. Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions. One of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series Felony Squad he edited in 1967. The episode, entitled [...] "My Mommy Got Lost", included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. [...] Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: [...] "Let's <b>try</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> that when we get down to Mexico!" [...] The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{legal experts}} {{have said that}} the United States could be obligated to <b>try</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its {{soldiers}} for war crimes. Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a [...] "grave breach". In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the root}} in other verses carries {{a sense of}} [...] "trial" [...] as simply a kind of test of a person's {{commitment}} to their faith (without necessarily implying that the testing results from something bad happening, as the sense of trial as [...] "tribulation" [...] might bear). For example, Qur'an [...] says, in part, [...] "And even so do We <b>try</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them by others." [...] Things widely recognized as good things in life may serve as trials, as Qur'an [...] and [...] make clear by describing one's own wealth and children as trials. Qur'an [...] also carries this sense of trial by something good; there, God's own [...] "boon" [...] (or [...] "blessing") {{is described as a}} trial for certain people. Again, in Qur'an , God will give those idolaters who decide to [...] "tread the right path" [...] an abundance of good [...] "that We may test them thereby," [...] to see whether they will turn away from God once they have obtained his favor or whether they will be steadfast in faith.|$|E
