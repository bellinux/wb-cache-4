Even Superboy fails when the Sun-Eater blasts him with red solar radiation. Ferro Lad tries to reach and destroy the cloud's core, but is rebuffed by an energy blast and does no damage to the cloud at all. The Sun-Eater reforms, prompting Tharok to construct an Absorbatron bomb, which can destroy the cloud if it is detonated at the core. Since Tharok {{had no time to}} build a propulsion device, one of them must carry the bomb to the core and detonate it manually — an act which would result in that person's death. Superboy is about to take the bomb, citing he has the best chance to survive, but he is still weak from the red sun rays. Ferro Lad punches Superboy, grabs the bomb and speeds toward the cloud. Reaching the core, Ferro Lad detonates the bomb, destroying both the Sun-Eater and himself.|$|E

50|$|Every state now {{implements}} Part C fully. The original legislation {{provided a}} five-year phase-in period {{for states to}} develop their comprehensive system of service for the affected population. Although IDEA does not mandate states' participation in Part H/C, powerful financial incentives {{from the federal government}} have led every state to participate. States were provided extensions of the 5-year period as they struggled with the logistic, interagency, and financial demands of developing a statewide system. To ensure a coordinated approach to service delivery and financing of services, federal regulations of Part C require that states develop interagency agreements that define the financial responsibility of each agency and impanel a state interagency coordinating council to assist the lead agency in implementing the statewide system. Regulations also prohibit the substitution of funds and reduction of benefits once <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> in each state (United States Department of Education, 1993). As states and federal territories (for example, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands) began to plan for implementation of P.L. 99-457 and later IDEA, their first obligation was to designate an agency that would provide leadership in the planning and administration of the state's comprehensive system. In 1989, 22 states or territories had the department of education as lead agency, 11 others had the department of health, another 9 had the department of human services, and the remaining states had combined departments or departments of mental health or developmental disabilities (Trohanis, 1989).|$|E

40|$|Currently, Haze {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} environmental problems with serious impacts on human health in China, especially in capital region (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region).

However, there is doubt whether these targets can be achieved once <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>implemented.</b> In this work, the effectiveness of NAPCAP is analyzed by developing models of the statistical relationship between PM 2. 5 concentrations and air pollutant emissions (SO 2, NOx, smoke and dust), while taking into account wind and neighboring transfer impacts. The model can also identify ways of calculating the intended emission levels in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. The results indicate that haze concentration control targets will not be attained by following the NAPCAP, and that the amount of progress needed to meet the targets is unrealistic. A more appropriate approach to reducing air emissions is proposed, which addresses joint regional efforts...|$|E

40|$|When {{transportation}} {{plans are}} developed, problem parameters {{are often not}} known with certainty. In addition, the parameters may vary throughout the time period during which <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>implemented.</b> Thus, improvements can often {{be made in the}} quality of such plans by accounting for this variability. However, incorporating stochasticity into problems that are already large-scale and difficult to solve is a significant challenge. Heuristic methods are often helpful, as is de-coupling a large problem into a series of smaller problems for which solution techniques may already exist. To contribute to the building of a toolkit for tackling such complex planning problems in a robust manner, we have chosen to focus on solving the stochastic knapsack problem with random weights (SKPRW). The deterministic knapsack problem is a classical problem {{with a wide range of}} transportation applications and a substantial body of literature. In this problem, there are a collection of objects, each with a given weight and value. The objective is to choose the set of objects with maximum collective value without exceeding an upper bound on their combined weight. We extend this deterministic knapsack problem literature by allowing the weights of each object to be random. We can view the SKPRW as a resource allocation problem. A planner is choosing amongst a series of business opportunities (for example, possible shipping customers). Each customer requires some quantity of a resource such as time, labor, physical materials, or space on a transportation link. The planner has a known, fixed, and finit...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Various curricular {{innovations}} {{were adopted}} by medical schools worldwide {{in an attempt}} to produce medical graduates that could meet future healthcare needs of society locally and globally. This paper presents findings on curricular approaches implemented in Malaysian medical schools, in trying to meet those needs. METHODS: Information was obtained from published records, responses from various questionnaires, personal communication and involvement with curricular development. RESULTS: Curricular innovations tended to be implemented in new medical schools upon their establishment. Established medical schools seemed to implement these innovations much later. Curricular trends appear to move towards integration, student-centred and problem-based learning as well as community-oriented medical education, with the Student-centred learning, Problem-based learning, Integrated teaching, Community-based education, Electives and Systematic programme (SPICES) model used as a reference. The focus is {{based on the premise that}} although the short-term aim of undergraduate medical education in Malaysia is to prepare graduates for the pre-registration house officer year, they must be able to practise and make decisions independently and be sensitive to the needs of the country's multiracial, multi-religious, and often remote communities. CONCLUSION: In most cases, curricular planning starts with a prescriptive model where planners focus on several intended outcomes. However, as <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> and evaluated it becomes descriptive as the planners reassess the internal and external factors that affect outcomes. A common trend in community-oriented educational activities is evident, with the introduction of interesting variations, to ensure that the curriculum can be implemented, sustained and the intended outcomes achieved...|$|E
