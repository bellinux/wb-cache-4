5|$|In 1669, <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House was {{demolished}} and the Crown Jewels {{moved into}} Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public. This was exploited {{two years later}} when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House keeper. Although they laid {{their hands on the}} Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Board of Works in 1751 concluded that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation. In particular, it lacked a kitchen and scullery, and the cooking was still being {{carried out in the}} ground floor rooms of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower. Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. <b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E

5|$|Since 1994, the Crown Jewels {{have been}} on display in <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House in the Waterloo Block. Some of the pieces are used {{regularly}} by the Queen. The display includes 23,578 gemstones, the 800-year-old Coronation Spoon, St. Edward's Crown (worn during all crownings at Westminster Abbey) and the Imperial State Crown.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower {{diminished in}} importance; {{probably}} during the 16th century, the palace walls {{on either side}} of the building were demolished, and part of the moat was filled in during 1551. By the 1590s, the tower had begun to be used both for the storage of the Lords' records and as a house for the parliamentary clerk. In 1600, a three-storey timber extension was built on the side of the tower for the clerk's use, as part of a wider renovation of the tower at a cost of £166, and the complex began to be termed the Parliament Office rather than <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower. The ground floor of the tower may have begun to be used as a kitchen and scullery for the new house at around this time.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower {{was taken}} over by the newly formed Standard Weights and Measures Department in 1869, who used it for storing and testing {{official}} weights and measures. The rising levels of London traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War, and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower is managed by English Heritage, receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.|$|E

5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} display in <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House took the regalia {{out of a}} {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E

In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense beds in the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliamentary}} clerk {{continued to}} live alongside the tower, except during the interregnum of 1649 and 1660, when the House of Lords was temporarily abolished. The sewer feeding into the moat was blocked up around {{the middle of the}} century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E
5|$|The ship's timbers and {{artefacts}} {{were shown}} {{to the public for}} the first time in 2011.

5|$|Following Panggilan Darah, Oriental– {{which had}} been losing money steadily– {{released}} its contract for the ANIF studio, which {{was taken over by}} the Dutch-run Multi Film. Despite hopes that they would continue producing narrative films, perhaps with less modern equipment, the company was dissolved. Oriental's actors and crew members migrated to different studios. Suska was signed to Java Industrial Film and directed a single film for them, Ratna Moetoe Manikam. Dhalia went to Populair's Film and acted in one production, Moestika dari Djemar (<b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> of Djemar; 1942), before the Japanese occupation in March 1942 closed that studio. Soerip, meanwhile, joined Njoo and Young at Majestic Film, acting in two productions before that studio was closed.|$|E
5|$|The house {{alongside}} <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower {{was taken}} over by the new department in 1869, and the standards and testing equipment were installed in the tower itself, which was felt to be particularly suitable for making scientific measurements, because of its thick walls.

5|$|The {{tower was}} placed into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works in 1948. The ministry carried out extensive repairs, attempting {{to retain a}} mixture of the medieval and newer features in the building. They removed the old medieval elm and oak foundations {{and replaced them with}} concrete supports, and installed a replacement roof in 1949, removing the first floor entrance and reinstalling the spiral staircase from the ground floor in 1953. The inside of the tower was rendered to hide the traces of the various work. <b>The</b> <b>Jewel</b> Tower was opened for tourists in 1956, and drew between 500 and 800 visitors each week.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession. Fonts are used at royal christenings, and altar plate {{is used for}} weddings, Royal Maundy, {{and a few other}} occasions. Many pieces have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used once. When not in use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year. Although {{they are part of the}} Royal Collection and owned by the king or queen for the duration of his or her reign, the Crown Jewels do not belong to the monarch personally.|$|E
5|$|Since the Restoration, {{there have}} been many {{additions}} and alterations to the regalia. A new set of regalia was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, CharlesII having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when MaryII was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband WilliamIII. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with paste and crystals for display in <b>the</b> <b>Jewel</b> House, a practice which continued until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
