5|$|The {{morning after}} the arrests the {{soldiers}} continued marching north, proceeding 10 miles (16 kilometers) further to <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> of Fishing Creek and {{the base of the}} mountains in northern Columbia County. From here they marched up the valley of East Branch Fishing Creek to its headwaters. The soldiers extensively searched the mountains of northern Columbia County for half a day, going as far north as <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> of East Branch Fishing Creek in southern Sullivan County, where they {{climbed to the top of}} North Mountain in three groups. At <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> of East Branch Fishing Creek the soldiers turned south again, then headed up West Branch Fishing Creek as far as the Sullivan County line. They found some evidence that people had been in the area, but these appeared to have been hunting or logging camps.|$|E

This situation is described and evaluated in the work. On the base of the results such corrective measures are suggested, which lead to ecological stability increase in <b>the</b> <b>headwater</b> basin, especially regarding drainage conditions. This measures can serve as the base for the initiation and realization of comprehensive landscape adjustments. For these purposes the management of the individual municipalities will be asked for their opinion regarding the realization of the comprehensive landscape adjustments...|$|R
