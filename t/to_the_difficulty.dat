5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|Few zoos hold termites, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{in keeping}} them captive {{and to the}} {{reluctance}} of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E

5|$|Lobster {{fishing was}} done {{on a small scale}} {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely to}} eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} estimated containment date had been delayed until July 7. According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely rough terrain that was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated containment date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because {{of the threat of}} flare ups within the burn area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final {{mix of the}} song on 21 April 1967. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> in getting the two 4-track machines to play {{at exactly the same}} time, only a mono mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this mono mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than using the April 1967 mono mix.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of components for chemical weapons {{were removed from}} Syria by a Norwegian/Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014. The 31 December deadline for complete removal of priority chemicals had been missed; on 7 January, the New York Times assessed the delay was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of overland transport of chemical weapons {{in the middle of}} a civil war. A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} also subject to criticism, however. Next Generation objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> level, {{wondering}} if the challenge was added to prolong the gameplay. The Electric Playground pointed to the unusual control scheme and lack of configuration options. GameSpy cited the camera's behavior, the learning curve for the controls, and graphical shortcomings such as flickering and jagginess. GameSpot criticized the game's conclusion for its dramatic change in gameplay to a rail shooter-like style at the story's climax, {{as well as a}} leveling-off of the difficulty. Lastly, Gamecritics felt that the story was overly short and the characters were underdeveloped.|$|E

5|$|This diverse {{range of}} music was only {{featured}} during the first series due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> in obtaining rights for commercial releases (leading to episodes of the first series being remade as an LP album without the proprietary background music in 1979). For series two Paddy Kingsland was commissioned to provide background music and for the third to fifth series Paul 'Wix' Wickens was chosen.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man. The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of Man, the force was not reorganised there partly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by {{the scope of the}} legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty,</b> many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

5|$|Almost There is {{the first}} major-label studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Pete Kipley, the album was {{released}} on August 14, 2001 by INO Records. After releasing six independent records, the band decided to pursue a record contract due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of selling, booking, and managing for themselves. The band signed with the newly formed INO Records, and were assigned to work with Kipley, who had not produced a major project before. Four of the songs on the album had previously appeared on the band's independent records; the rest were newly recorded songs. The album is a worship and pop rock album, and adopts a more radio-friendly sound than the band's independent albums.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{of travel}} in the late 18th century, {{very few of the}} {{selected}} delegates were present on the designated day of May 14, 1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured. (New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.) James Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation produced the Virginia Plan, which was designed and written by James Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
