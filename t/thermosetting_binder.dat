40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{machinability}} of aluminium nitride green bodies obtained from dry pressing of spray-dried granules. The characterisation of the green machinability of ceramics is not easy. Indeed, to date, no conventional mechanical test able to represent the machining behaviour of green powder ceramic compacts. Therefore, the first target of this work is to determine possible correlations between mechanical properties, microstructure and machinability and to propose suitable tests. Three types of aluminium nitride granules are investigated. Two of theses types of granules are commercial grades using a thermoplastic binder: a conventional grade for pressing and a specific grade especially developed for green machining. The third grade is under development and uses a <b>thermoset</b> <b>binder.</b> From this work {{it appears that the}} compacts containing the <b>thermoset</b> <b>binder</b> exhibit simultaneously the highest mechanical properties and the best behaviour at machining. The good machinability has been correlated to a highwork of fracture together with a transgranular mode of fracture of the material...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{processing}} {{technique was}} recently developed to realize plastic deformation in wood impregnated with a <b>thermoset</b> <b>binder.</b> This paper proposes a new flow forming technique where a thermoplastic binder {{is used instead}} of a <b>thermoset</b> <b>binder</b> {{with the expectation that}} the formability and recyclability of the products will be improved. To clarify the effect of the thermoplastic binder on the flow deformation behavior of wood, capillary fluidity tests were performed using impregnated wood with various contents of thermoplastic binder (polymer). The extrusion load of the impregnated wood through the capillary decreased with an increase of the polymer content in the wood. Results of the second fluidity test using the first extruded material reveals that the recycled impregnated wood can flow again. The extrusion load of the second extrusion was equal to or lower than the first. These results indicate that the recyclability of the wood impregnated with a thermoplastic binder is highly promising. The internal configuration of the impregnated wood during extrusion was also dependent on the polymer content...|$|R

In the present paper a newly developed method for the manufacturing of binder rovings is defined. The binder roving consists of heavy tow carbon fibers combined with <b>thermoset</b> <b>binder</b> material. Different manufacturing units, such as the binder conveying system or the binder application system, were developed and optimized regarding the distribution quality and the output rate. For all tests a 50 k SGL roving and a Huntsman XB 3366 binder material were used as input material...|$|R

Experimental test for checking the {{possibility of}} component combination has been carried out. Quality of materials has been examined.

40|$|Shell mold casting or {{shell molding}} is a metal casting process in {{manufacturing}} industry {{in which the}} mold is a thin hardened shell of sand and <b>thermosetting</b> resin <b>binder</b> backed up by some other material. The internal surface of the shell mold is very smooth and rigid. This allows for an easy flow of the liquid metal through the mold cavity during the pouring of the casting, giving castings a very good surface finish. Shell mold casting enables the manufacture of complex parts with thin sections and smaller projections than green sand mold casting. Manufacturing with the shell mold process also imparts high dimensional accuracy. Tolerances of. 010 inches (. 25 mm) are possible. Further machining is usually unnecessary when casting by this process. Shell mold casting is particularly suitable for steel castings under 20 lbs; however almost any metal that can be cast in sand can be cast with shell molding process. Also much larger parts have been manufactured with shell molding. Typical parts manufactured in industry using the shell mold casting process include cylinder heads, gears, bushings, connecting rods, camshafts and valve bodies...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymer (GFRP) waste recycling {{is very limited}} and restricted by <b>thermoset</b> nature of <b>binder</b> matrix and lack of economically viable enduse applications for the recyclates. In this study, efforts were made in order to recycle grinded GFRP waste proceeding from pultrusion production scrap, into new and sustainable composite materials. For this purpose, GFRP waste recyclates, a mix of powdered and fibrous materials, were incorporated into polyester based mortars as fine aggregate and filler replacements, at different load contents (between 4 % up to 12 % of total mass) and particle size distributions. Potential recycling solution was assessed by mechanical behaviour of resultant GFRP waste modified polymer mortars. Test results revealed that GFRP waste filled polymer mortars present improved flexural and compressive behaviour over unmodified polyester based mortars, thus indicating the feasibility of GFRP waste reuse in concrete-polymer composites...|$|R
40|$|A {{microfabrication}} {{process is}} described that {{provides for the}} batch realization of miniature rare earth based permanent magnets. Prismatic geometry with features as small as 5 microns, thicknesses up through several hundred microns and with submicron tolerances may be accommodated. The processing {{is based on a}} molding technique using deep x-ray lithography as a means to generate high aspect-ratio precision molds from PMMA (poly methyl methacrylate) used as an x-ray photoresist. Subsequent molding of rare-earth permanent magnet (REPM) powder combined with a <b>thermosetting</b> plastic <b>binder</b> may take place directly in the PMMA mold. Further approaches generate an alumina form replicated from the PMMA mold that becomes an intermediate mold for pressing higher density REPM material and allows for higher process temperatures. Maximum energy products of 3 [...] 8 MGOe (Mega Gauss Oersted, 1 MGOe = 100 / 4 {pi} kJ/m{sup 3 }) are obtained for bonded isotropic forms of REPM with dimensions on the scale of 100 microns and up to 23 MGOe for more dense anisotropic REPM material using higher temperature processing. The utility of miniature precision REPMs is revealed by the demonstration of a miniature multipole brushless DC motor that possesses a pole-anisotropic rotor with dimensions that would otherwise prohibit multipole magnetization using a multipole magnetizing fixture at this scale. Subsequent multipole assembly also leads to miniaturized Halbach arrays, efficient magnetic microactuators, and mechanical spring-like elements which can offset miniaturized mechanical scaling behavior...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{injection}} moulding (MIM) is an innovative {{injection moulding}} technique widely {{used to produce}} complex shaped components from feedstock composed of metal powders and <b>thermosetting</b> or thermoplastic <b>binders.</b> In MIM, binder selection and formulation are considered as critical processes since binder characteristics dictate the success of MIM. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the feasibility of polyvinyl butyryl (PVB) based binder system in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V(wt. %) /binder feedstock, as well as to understand the effects of key parameters, such as powder loading and mixing conditions on the rheological properties of a feedstock. In this study, PVB, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and stearic acid (SA) were chosen to formulate a multi-component binder system to prepare Ti- 6 Al- 4 V based feedstock with the aid of three types of mixers: a compounder, a modified mechanical mixer and a twin screw extruder. Further, morphological analysis was performed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Thermal analysis was performed using simultaneous differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. Results showed that binder formulation was reasonably successful with the aid of both mechanical mixer and a twin screw extruder under certain mixing conditions, and the critical powder loading was 68 vol. %, resulting in an optimum powder loading of 63 vol. %...|$|R
