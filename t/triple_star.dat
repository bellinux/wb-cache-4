40|$|We {{consider}} {{the formation of}} binary black hole mergers through the evolution of field massive <b>triple</b> <b>stars.</b> In this scenario, favorable conditions for the inspiral {{of a black hole}} binary are initiated by its gravitational interaction with a distant companion, rather than by a common-envelope phase invoked in standard binary evolution models. We use a code that follows self-consistently the evolution of massive <b>triple</b> <b>stars,</b> combining the secular triple dynamics (Lidov-Kozai cycles) with stellar evolution. After a black hole triple is formed, its dynamical evolution is computed using either the orbit-averaged equations of motion, or a high-precision direct integrator for triples with weaker hierarchies for which the secular perturbation theory breaks down. Most black hole mergers in our models are produced in the latter non-secular dynamical regime. We derive the properties of the merging binaries and compute a black hole merger rate in the range (0. 3 - 1. 3) Gpc^{- 3 }yr^{- 1 }, or up to ~ 2. 5 Gpc^{- 3 }yr^{- 1 } if the black hole orbital planes have initially random orientation. Finally, we show that black hole mergers from the triple channel have significantly higher eccentricities than those formed through the evolution of massive binaries or in dense star clusters. Measured eccentricities could therefore be used to uniquely identify binary mergers formed through the evolution of <b>triple</b> <b>stars.</b> While our results suggest up to ~ 10 detections per year with Advanced-LIGO, the high eccentricities could render the merging binaries harder to detect with planned space based interferometers such as LISA.

5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of <b>triple</b> <b>star</b> systems.

The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|Theta Muscae is a <b>triple</b> <b>star</b> system {{thought to}} be around 7,500light-years distant. It {{consists}} of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolf–Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous: combined, {{they are likely to}} be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15times that of the Sun. The stars are so close that they are in contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4days.|$|E
5|$|The {{star system}} is the {{prototype}} {{of a group of}} eclipsing binary stars named Algol variables, though it has a third member to make up what is actually a <b>triple</b> <b>star</b> system. The brightest component is a blue-white main-sequence star of spectral type B8V, which is 3.5 times as massive and 180 times as luminous as the Sun. The secondary component is an orange subgiant star of type K0IV that has begun cooling and expanding to 3.5 times the radius of the Sun, and has 4.5 times the luminosity and 80% of its mass. These two are separated by only 0.05 astronomical units (AU)—five percent of the distance between the Earth and Sun; the main dip in brightness arises when the larger fainter companion passes in front of the hotter brighter primary. The tertiary component is a main sequence star of type A7, which is located on average 2.69 AU from the other two stars. AG Persei is another Algol variable in Perseus, whose primary component is a B-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.69. Phi Persei is a double star, although the two components do not eclipse each other.

Zeta is a <b>triple</b> <b>star</b> system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{observational}} surveys have revealed that high-order multiple-star systems (e. g. triples, quadruples, etc.), and triples in particular, are common in our Galaxy. In this paper, we consider the dynamical significance of this transformation {{in our understanding of}} stellar multiplicity. Using empirically constrained binary and triple fractions in those star clusters for which these values are available in the literature, we compare analytic rates for encounters involving single, binary, and <b>triple</b> <b>stars.</b> Our results show that, even for relatively low triple fractions, dynamical interactions involving triples occur roughly as often as encounters involving either single or binary stars alone, particularly in low-mass star clusters. More generally, using empirically-derived multiple star catalogues for the young star-forming association Taurus-Auriga and the Galactic field, we show that the data are consistent with the gravitationally-focused cross section for encounters increasing with increasing multiplicity. Consequently, <b>triple</b> <b>stars,</b> and even higher-order multiples, could be more important than previously realized for a number of astrophysical phenomena, including the formation and destruction of compact binaries and various types of stellar exotica, and the dynamical evolution of star clusters.
