5000|$|Spun yarn {{is made by}} {{twisting}} staple fibres {{together to}} make a cohesive thread, or [...] "single." [...] Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic, and yarn spinning was one of the very first processes to be industrialized. Spun yarns may contain a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre,</b> or be a blend of various types. Combining synthetic fibres (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} as break {{spinning}} or rotor spinning. The principle behind open-end spinning {{is similar to that of}} a clothes dryer spinning full of sheets. If you could open the door and pull out a sheet, it would spin together as you pulled it out. Sliver from the card goes into the rotor, is spun into yarn and comes out, wrapped up on a bobbin, all ready to go to the next step. There is no roving stage or re-packaging on an auto-coner. This system is much less labour-intensive and faster than ring spinning with rotor speeds up to 140,000 rpm. The Rotor design is the key to the operation of the open-ended spinners. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> may require a different rotor design for optimal product quality and processing speed.|$|E

The response of two of these instruments (FM- 7400 and Fibrecheck FC- 2) was compared with the conventional method of sampling on filters and counting by phase contrast microscopy. Four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> were studied at different concentrations and relative humidity levels. The FM- 7400 can be calibrated by the manufacturer for two different levels of sensitivity (standard and high). For the tests where it was set to the sensitivity level with which it had been calibrated, {{the ratio of the}} concentration measured by the instrument to the concentration obtained by the conventional method varied in the range 0. 5 – 1 for the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> studied (chrysotile, glass wool and ceramic fibres). The Fibrecheck FC- 2 is a much less versatile instrument. On the basis of a calibration allowing correct detection <b>of</b> asbestos <b>fibres,</b> it greatly overestimated the concentration <b>of</b> man-made mineral <b>fibres.</b> In its normal calibration state a fine chrysotile aerosol was poorly detected. For man-made mineral fibres, the response was highly dependent on the nature <b>of</b> the <b>fibres.</b> These instruments require calibration with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> to be studied. Unfortunately, this operation is not always accessible to the user and may require the services of a specialized laboratory, as the manufacturer is not always in a position to carry this out...|$|R

5000|$|A rebozo {{is a long}} {{straight}} {{piece of}} cloth {{which looks like a}} cross between a scarf and a shawl. Like ponchos, huipils and sarapes they are classic Mexican garments made of straight, mostly uncut cloth, but rebozos have their own characteristics. It is classically a woman’s garment, traditionally hand woven, distinguished by complicated finger woven fringes called rapacejos. The wearing of the rebozo is said to make the movement of a woman more graceful. The wearing of a rebozo by many women is a sign of Mexican heritage, and for that reason, sales of the garment can double before Mexican Independence Day on September 16. [...] Because {{of the nature of the}} garment, especially the fringes, they should be hand washed. The dye may or may not be colorfast so mild soap should be used.While all rebozos are rectangular woven cloth with fringes, there is significant variation within these constraints. There are three classes of rebozos. Traditional ones have a design created with the ikat dying technique and come in various set patterns. Regional rebozos are more colorful and their origins can be identified, especially those from Oaxaca, Chiapas and Guerrero. Contemporary rebozos experiment with non-traditional fibres and designs. Sizes vary with lengths varying anywhere from 1.5 to about 3.5 meters long. [...] Most Mexican rebozos are made from cotton, wool, silk or rayon. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> used is the main factor in determining a price of a piece which can vary from a couple hundred pesos to thousands of pesos, with fine pure silk pieces being the most expensive. The finest silk rebozos can be passed through a wedding ring.Rebozo colors and patterns vary widely and traditional designs can usually identify where it was made. For example, a tightly woven black and indigo version is identified with the mountains areas of the state of Michoacán. [...] Designs are generally classified as “classic” and “indigenous.” Classic rebozos come in various colors with designs based on the pre Hispanic art of plumaría, or creating images with feathers. Some of these have their fringes knotted to form images of animals and stares. However, almost all are created with the ikat technique. The most famous classic rebozo style is called “de bolitas” whose name comes from little knots of string tied onto groups of threads used in its production. Among indigenous groups designs and colors almost always indicate with group the woman belongs. [...] While most rebozos use more than one color, monochrome versions are called “chalinas.” ...|$|E
