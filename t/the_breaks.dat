5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC being described as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC {{with a group of}} core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new experiences for players.|$|E

40|$|In fission yeast mating-type {{switching}} is {{initiated by}} {{the formation of a}} double-strand DNA <b>break</b> at <b>the</b> mating-type locus. A prerequisite for generation of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is some 'imprinting' of the DNA in the previous cell cycle.

On one strand <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is situated very close to the right-hand border of the expressed mat 1 cassette. Cells of opposite mating type, P and M, have their breaks at slightly different positions on this strand. On the other DNA strand of both alleles the ends are probably masked by tightly bound proteins and therefore the precise nature of <b>the</b> <b>break</b> could not be determined. Since <b>the</b> <b>break</b> is stable throughout the cell cycle, these proteins may function in vivo to confer structural stability on the chromosomes having <b>the</b> <b>break.</b> <b>The</b> implications of these findings for models of mating-type switching are discussed...|$|R

25|$|William John Simmons III {{was born}} on September 25, 1969, to William Simmons and Jan Corbo. His father was a school administrator, and his stepmother, Molly Clark, is a doctor. Simmons {{was an only child}} and grew up in Marlborough and Brookline, Massachusetts, before moving to Stamford, Connecticut, to live with his mother after his parents {{divorced}} when he was 13. He attended the Greenwich Country Day School and then Brunswick School in Greenwich, Connecticut, for high school. In 1988, he completed a postgraduate year at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school located in Wallingford, Connecticut. As a child Simmons read David Halberstam's book <b>The</b> <b>Breaks</b> of the Game, which he credited as the single most formative development in his sportswriting career.|$|E
25|$|Later in his career, Halberstam {{turned to}} sports, {{publishing}} <b>The</b> <b>Breaks</b> of the Game, {{an inside look}} at Bill Walton and the 1979-80 Portland Trail Blazers basketball team; Summer of '49, on the baseball pennant race battle between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox; October 1964, on the 1964 World Series between the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals; Playing for Keeps, an ambitious book on Michael Jordan in 1999; The Teammates: A Portrait of a Friendship, focusing on the relationships between several members of the Boston Red Sox in the 1940s; and The Education of a Coach, about New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Much of his sports writing, particularly his baseball books, focuses on the personalities of the players and the times they lived in as much as on the games themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{damage was}} {{greatest}} both near, and well {{north of the}} surface faulting, {{as well as at}} the foot of the mountains. The hospital buildings, the freeway overpasses, and the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility were situated on coarse alluvium that overlaid thousands of feet of loosely consolidated sedimentary material. Underground water, sewer, and gas systems did not fare well in the city of San Fernando where <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> were too numerous to count, and some sections were so badly damaged that they were abandoned. Ground displacement damaged sidewalks and roadways, with cracks in the more rigid asphalt and concrete often exceeding the width of the shift in the underlying soil. Accentuated damage near alluvium had been documented previously during the investigation of the effects of the 1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes. A band of similarly intense damage further away near Ventura Boulevard at the southern end of the valley was also identified as having been related to soil type.|$|E
25|$|Each Okazaki {{fragment}} is {{preceded by}} an RNA primer, which is {{displaced by the}} procession of the next Okazaki fragment during synthesis. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA hybrids that are created {{by the use of}} RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand, leaving behind a primer:template junction. DNA polymerase α, recognizes these sites and elongates <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> left by primer removal. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases. At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by DNA ligase I, which repairs the nicks that are left between the 3'-OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand. Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic Okazaki fragment, DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading-strand synthesis. DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates an {{efficient}} estimation method for a cointegrating regression model with structural change.

25|$|From 2009 onwards, Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{expanded}} its temporary ordination program {{by making it}} nationwide.

The program was held twice a year, and the participants who decided to stay in the monkhood were encouraged to revive abandoned temples. In 2010, 10,685 monks joined the program. As part of the ordination programs, Wat Phra Dhammakaya started to organize pilgrimages passing important places in the life of Luang Pu Sodh. This was done through a procession by over a thousand monks through the areas of Central Thailand that were flooded before, while life-size images of Luang Pu Sodh were ceremonially brought to install in pilgrimage places. During <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> between the walks, the monks spent their time meditating, chanting and making good wishes to those affected by the floods.|$|E
