5|$|The {{panel is}} rich in Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} the shift in religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. The painting is devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} starts {{on the topic}} of Greek {{philosophy}}. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E
5|$|This belief persisted {{into the}} Medieval era, with many {{scholars}} arguing that Virgil not only prophesied Christ {{prior to his}} birth but also {{that he was a}} pre-Christian prophet. Dante Alighieri included Virgil as a main character in his Divine Comedy, and Michelangelo included the Cumaean Sibyl on the ceiling painting of the Sistine Chapel (a reference to the widespread belief that the Sibyl herself prophesied <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> and Virgil used her prophecies to craft his poem). Modern scholars, such as Robin Nisbet, tend to eschew this interpretation, arguing that seemingly Judeo-Christian elements of the poem can be explained through means other than divine prophecy.|$|E

5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a {{set back}} for his health but he soon {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E
5|$|Altdorfer's primary {{point of}} {{reference}} in his research was probably Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated world history published in Nuremberg in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his Chronicle {{was one of the}} first books produced on the printing press. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the seven ages of human history, from Creation to <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> and ending with the Apocalypse. Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in The Battle of Alexander at Issus: the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist. Since the Chronicle describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the Apostle Paul, which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal. Another source may have been the writings of Quintus Curtius Rufus, a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.|$|E
5|$|In October 1604, {{a bright}} new evening star (SN 1604) appeared, but Kepler {{did not believe}} the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began {{systematically}} observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon, the start of the about 800-year cycle of great conjunctions; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne (c. 800 years earlier) and <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his De Stella Nova. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the Star of Bethlehem—analogous to the present new star—would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.|$|E

25|$|One of the longest-established {{minority}} religious faiths in Italy is Judaism, Jews {{having been}} present in Ancient Rome since before <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> Italy has for centuries welcomed Jews expelled from other countries, notably Spain.

25|$|The {{earliest}} extant Christian {{writings on}} {{the age of the}} world according to the Biblical chronology are by Theophilus (AD 115–181), the sixth bishop of Antioch from the Apostles, in his apologetic work To Autolycus, and by Julius Africanus (AD 200–245) in his Five Books of Chronology. Both of these early Christian writers, following the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, determined the age of the world to have been about 5,530 years at <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} the portal may be arched, or may be set with a lintel {{supporting}} a tympanum, generally carved, but in Italy sometimes decorated with mosaic or fresco.

Lateral doors may include other subjects such as <b>the</b> <b>Birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> The portal may be protected by a porch, with simple open porches being typical of Italy, and more elaborate structures typical of France and Spain.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish scriptures were {{translated}} into Greek {{in the two}} centuries immediately before <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> The Greek version of these books is called the Septuagint. The Jewish Bible in Hebrew is called the Masoretic text (meaning passing down after a Hebrew word Masorah; for Jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text). The Greek (Septuagint) version of Ezekiel differs considerably from the Hebrew (Masoretic) version – it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book we have today (according to the masoretic tradition) – while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both.|$|E
25|$|The longest-established {{religious}} faith in Italy is Judaism, Jews having been present in Ancient Rome before <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Christ.</b> Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as Luigi Luzzatti, who {{took office in}} 1910, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). During the Holocaust, Italy took in many Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. However, {{with the creation of}} the Nazi-backed puppet Italian Social Republic, about 15% of Italy's Jews were killed, despite the Fascist government's refusal to deport Jews to Nazi death camps. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.|$|E
