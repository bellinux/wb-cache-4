5000|$|Polyester is {{the most}} recent film base to have been developed. It was first used for {{specialized}} photography applications in 1955, {{but it was only}} in the 1990s that it became overwhelmingly popular for motion picture prints. It is highly preferable for post-production, exhibition, and archival purposes because of its flexibility, strength, and stability. Its strength is sometimes also seen as a disadvantage, however, in that polyester-base films are so resistant to breakage that they are often more likely to break the film equipment should a jam or extra tension occur.

40|$|International audienceAmong natural biopolymers, polysaccharides and {{proteins}} {{are very}} promising for biodegradable and edible wraps with different characteristics, {{so that their}} formulations can be tailor-made to suit {{the needs of a}} specific commodity. Films prepared from polysaccharides have good gas barrier properties but exhibit lower resistance to moisture compared to protein films (edible) <b>or</b> <b>polylactide</b> films (biodegradable). Protein-based films show better mechanical and oxygen barrier properties compared to polysaccharide films. For that reason, film performances may be enhanced by producing blend systems, where hydrocolloids (mixtures of proteins and/or polysaccharides) form a continuous and more cohesive network. However, the lower water barrier properties of hydrocolloid films and their lower mechanical strength in comparison with synthetic polymers limit their applications in food packaging. Therefore, the enhancement of biopolymer film properties has been studied to attain appropriate applications.

Joining such thin films requires a tight control of several process parameters and of material homogeneity. Among the available technologies, heat sealing is widely applied along with solvent based gluing that is the more traditional technique. In this paper, welds of thin polymeric films have been produced {{by means of a}} solid-state Laser source and the solvent based technique with the aim to compare their performances.

Polymer micelles from amphiphilic block copolymers are supramolecular core-shell type assemblies of some tens of nanometers in diameter. They are highly stable {{in aqueous solution}} because of their low intrinsic critical micelle concentration, which prevents their dissociation upon dilution in the blood stream after intravenous injection. The combination of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with hydrophobic aliphatic polyesters, such as poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) <b>or</b> <b>polylactide</b> (PLA), allows to prepare stealthy drug nanocarriers (thanks to PEO), which are biodegradable and biocompatible and capable of encapsulating a hydrophobic drug (due to the aliphatic polyester). In this field, the inclusion of an additional pH-responsive block in the supramolecular assembly is a promising strategy to improve the targeting of tumor tissues {{by taking advantage of}} the lower pH at the vicinity of tumor cells. A variety of novel amphiphilic and pH-sensitive copolymers have been synthesized and tested as building blocks for the design of smart nanocarriers able to expose selectively the targeting unit at the vicinity of tumor. Various macromolecular architectures combining PEO, PCL and P 2 VP have been accordingly synthesized such as linear and star shape di- and triblock copolymers. Their (co) -micellization has been studied in terms of size, particle shape (DLS, TEM) and stealth behavior.

40|$|Aliphatic polyesters such as polycaprolactone and {{polylactide}} {{have received}} more attention {{in recent years}} for their use in biomedical applications because of their biodegradable nature. These polymers are often synthesized using homogeneous metal complexes. Unfortunately, using homogeneous metals as catalysts leads to metal contamination in the product polymer, a result which is highly undesirable in a polymer intended for biomedical use. More recent work has shown that these polymers can be synthesized using homogeneous metal-free complexes. These catatlysts are generally less active than metal catalysts, and although they do not contaminate the polymer with metal residue, they are still difficult to recover and hence recycle for further use. In this work, we attempted to create a metal-free, silica-supported catalyst {{for use in the}} synthesis of polycaprolactone <b>or</b> <b>polylactide.</b> Ultimately, n-propylsulfonic acid-functionalized porous and nonporous silica materials are evaluated in the ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone. All catalysts allow for the controlled polymerization of the monomer, producing polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow polydispersities. Polymerization rates are low, with site-time-yields generally one to three orders of magnitude lower than metal-based systems. The catalysts are easily recovered from the polymerization solution after use and are shown to contain significant residual adsorbed polymer. Solvent extraction techniques are useful for removing most of the polymer, although the extracted solids are not effective catalysts in recycle experiments.

By end-capping the hydrophilic segment by a targeting moiety so that they may interact with membrane receptors, the biodistribution of polymeric micelles and nanoparticles stabilized with this copolymer can be modulated and can induce specific cellular uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. One class of interesting targeting agent is the saccharides, in particular the mannose, because of its specific interaction with mannose receptor, which are found on peripheral and bone marrow macrophages, dendritic cells and sinusoidal liver cells. In this study, the reductive amination reaction is use to attach this targeting agent. After optimisation of the reaction with amino fluorescein, a model amine, mannosylated copolymer of PEO and PCL has been prepared. The surface availability of the saccharide upon the micelles in aqueous phosphate buffer was then assessed by DLS through binding with the protein Concanavalin A (ConA), a known mannose receptor.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} {{was to examine the}} effects of {{electron}} radiation on physicochemical properties of pristine poly(lactic acid) (PLA), <b>or</b> <b>polylactide,</b> and of polylactide containing a selected crosslinking agent. Design/methodology/approach: Samples to be examined were prepared in granulated forms or as moulded pieces and then treated with the high-energy electron radiation (ca. 10 MeV). The methods of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), rheology, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMA) were used to determine physicochemical properties of the samples. A humidity sensor was utilised to determine water vapour permeability. Findings: It has been found that PLA undergoes degradation upon the electron radiation. Triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) when introduced into polylactide causes plasticization of this polymer whereas irradiation of polylactide containing TAIC leads to crosslinking of PLA. Crosslinked PLA exhibits limited plastic flow or no flow at all and an elevated glass transition temperature. Water vapour permeability of a film made of PLA modified this way is much less than that of a film produced from original PLA. Research limitations/implications: Further studies of crosslinked PLA are advisable, especially assessment of the gelation degree, strength of the plasticized material, and biodegradation. Practical implications: Crosslinked PLA may be applied in practical processes, especially in thermoforming in which increased resistance of a material against deformation at elevated temperatures is required. Originality/value: Substantial influence of the electron radiation on properties of PLA was established. The material undergoes significant degradation upon even relatively small radiation doses. In order to crosslink PLA, TAIC in the amount of ca. 3 wt% and the electron radiation doses of up to ca. 60 kGy have to be applied...|$|R

The lack of biocompatibility of the dialysis membrane, which results in low-grade inflammation, could be responsible for this malnutrition.

Methods: Five patients were dialyzed during 2 periods of 3 weeks (cross-over) with either a single-use low-flux polysulfone <b>or</b> cellulose <b>triacetate</b> (biocompatible) <b>or</b> a single-use cuprophan (bio-incompatible) membrane.

Results: Cuprophan was a more powerful activator of the complement system than other membranes. Protein metabolism parameters during both study protocols were not different and resulted in the same protein balance during polysulfone/cellulose triacetate (- 15 +/- 3) and cuprophan (- 13 +/- 2 mu mol/kg/h) dialysis.

40|$|Introduction: Polylactic acid <b>or</b> <b>polylactide</b> (PLA, Poly) is a {{biodegradable}} thermoplastic aliphatic polyester {{derived from}} renewable resources, such as corn starch, tapioca roots, chips or starch, or sugarcane. Biopolymer nanocomposites are {{of great interest}} to the packaging industry as they can overcome the limitations of biopolymers compared to synthetic polymers. In the last two decades, the nanocomposites have been studied intensively, once the addition of fillers such as organoclays, in particular, montmorillonite (MMT), can improve rheological, thermal and mechanical properties of the biopolymers (Jollands M. et al. 2010). The presence of MMT can lead to materials which generally exhibit great property enhancements, mainly due to its intercalation or exfoliation into the polymer chains. In this work, PLA was incorporated with 5 % (w/w) Cloisite Na+ prepared through a two-step process: first extrusion of pellets and secondly melted matter was pressed. The nanocomposite was used to pack a model food (salami) in order to evaluate of the ability of the new packaging to inhibit lipid oxidation. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) assay was used to evaluate the lipid oxidation stage. This assay allows to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) content, which is formed in the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Material and Methods: Packaged salami was homogenized with trichloroacetic acid (10 %) in 0. 02 M of orthophosphoric acid and the solution was filtered. The filtered solution was homogenized with thiobarbituric acid aqueous solution (0. 02 M) and heated at 100 °C for 40 min. Solutions were cooled down and absorbance was measured at 530 nm. Results were expressed as mg MDA per kg of salami. Results and Discussion: Salami slices were packaged with a control film and with the nanocomposite and analysed at initial time and after 15, 30, 60 and 90 days of contact. Results showed that salami packaged with the nanocomposite presented lower amount of MDA after all contact periods, except after 60 days, where there were no differences between control and nanofilm. Conclusion: Although the results showed that the new nanocomposite tends to reduce the production of MDA, further studies should be carried out to confirm the inhibition of lipid oxidation, such as the peroxide index, p-anisidine value, or the monitorization of a lipid oxidation indicator like hexanal.

40|$|One {{constrain}} {{in the use}} of micellar carriers as {{drug delivery}} systems (DDSs) is their low stability in aqueous solution. In this study "tree-shaped" copolymers of general formula mPEG-(PLA) n (n = 1, 2 or 4; mPEG = poly(ethylene glycol) monomethylether 2 K or 5 K Da; PLA = atactic <b>or</b> isotactic <b>poly(lactide))</b> were synthesized to evaluate the architecture and chemical composition effect on the micelles formation and stability. Copolymers with mPEG/PLA ratio of about 1 : 1 wt/wt were obtained using a "core-first" synthetic route. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), and Zeta Potential measurements showed that mPEG 2 K-(PD,LLA) 2 copolymer, characterized by mPEG chain of 2000 Da and two blocks of atactic PLA, was able to form monodisperse and stable micelles. To analyze the interaction among micelles and tumor cells, FITC conjugated mPEG-(PLA) n were synthesized. The derived micelles were tested on two, histological different, tumor cell lines: HEK 293 t and HeLa cells. Fluorescence Activated Cells Sorter (FACS) analysis showed that the FITC conjugated mPEG 2 K-(PD,LLA) 2 copolymer stain tumor cells with high efficiency. Our data demonstrate that both PEG size and PLA structure control the biological interaction between the micelles and biological systems. Moreover, using confocal microscopy analysis, the staining of tumor cells obtained after incubation with mPEG 2 K-(PD,LLA) 2 was shown to be localized inside the tumor cells. Indeed, the mPEG 2 K-(PD,LLA) 2 paclitaxel-loaded micelles mediate a potent antitumor cytotoxicity effect. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new modality for administering aminoglycosides to hemodialysis (HD) patients, namely, {{a modification of}} the once-daily regimen which consists of administering the aminoglycosides over 60 min by drip infusion just before each HD session, with a preplanned peak concentration being reached {{at the beginning of}} the session and then with a rapidly decreasing concentration being achieved by the start of HD. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), i. e., the accumulation of the drug in the body, is thus minimized by this modality. Arbekacin (ABK) was given at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight to 10 HD patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for 2 weeks (six sessions in total), resulting in the complete disappearance of MRSA in 5 patients. A high rate of elimination of ABK was attained for each patient while the patient was on HD (range, 0. 20 to 0. 42 h- 1; mean 0. 28 +/- 0. 08 h- 1) by using high-performance dialyzers provided with membranes made of either polymethylmethacrylate, cellulose <b>triacetate</b> (CTA), <b>or</b> ethylene vinyl alcohol. The best results were obtained with the CTA membrane, as revealed by the overall mass transfer coefficient (Ko). The AUC in the simulation model for the variation in the serum ABK concentration in this modality was calculated to be 40 % of that of the conventional post-HD dosing modality, suggesting that a much higher dose could be administered to HD patients who receive HD thrice weekly (4 h per session), giving, e. g., 4 mg/kg initially and before the HD sessions, when there is an interval of 68 h from HD session to HD session, and giving 2 mg/kg before the other sessions...|$|R
