5|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the {{development}} of {{the first phase of the}} Lower Churchill Project—Muskrat Falls. Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> for Muskrat Falls. <b>The</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would reduce <b>the</b> cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development.

40|$|ACL- 2 International audienceWe analyze in {{this paper}} how various forms of state {{intervention}} can impact microfinance institutions’ lending behavior. Using a simple model where entrepreneurs receive individual uncollateralized loans, we show that, not surprisingly, state intervention through <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> increases <b>the</b> number of entrepreneurs receiving a loan. However, after modeling business development services (BDS) provided by the microfinance institution, we show that <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> can have a counterproductive effect by {{reducing the number of}} entrepreneurs benefiting from such services. We therefore analyze an alternative policy: BDS subsidization. We show that if BDS are efficient enough and are targeted toward less performing borrowers, then-for fixed government expenditures-such subsidies do better in terms of financial inclusion than <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Moreover, we argue that-under similar conditions-BDS subsidization alone does better in terms of financial inclusion than a mix of policies.

40|$|Excerpt] The American {{automobile}} industry has serious financial problems. Corporate executives from the Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) have testified before Congress about {{their need for}} federal credit (direct <b>loans</b> and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>loans).</b> This report examines <b>the</b> Chrysler <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> program for possible insights that could assist Members of Congress in evaluating proposals to provide federal credit assistance. In 1979, Chrysler applied for federal <b>loan</b> <b>guarantees.</b> In 1979 and 1980, the economy was in recession {{and the price of}} oil had unexpectedly increased dramatically. However, at that time there was no financial liquidity crisis, as is the case today. Most of the arguments for and against <b>the</b> proposed Chrysler <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> program are relevant to current proposals for credit assistance to the Big Three. For example, in the 1979 debate, proponents argued that <b>the</b> Chrysler <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would save many jobs. But opponents contended that the financial capital obtained for Chrysler by <b>the</b> proposed <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> would have been used by other firms to expand their productive facilities, output, and employment. Thus, any Chrysler job losses could be offset by gains at other firms. Provisions in <b>the</b> Chrysler <b>Loan</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Act of 1979 included the establishment of a Chrysler <b>Loan</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Board, extensive federal oversight of Chrysler’s operations, detailed reporting requirements by Chrysler’s management, shared sacrifice of parties benefiting from <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee,</b> and protection of the federal government’s interest. Chrysler used federal <b>loan</b> <b>guarantees</b> to borrow $ 1. 2 billion of the $ 1. 5 billion available and redeemed its <b>guaranteed</b> <b>loans</b> in 1982. Some critics argued that Chrysler was only able to return to profitability because of the imposition by the U. S. government of “voluntary” import quotas on Japanese vehicles. In 1980, <b>the</b> Chrysler <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> was treated as a contingent liability with no initial cost at the time the guarantee was provided. Because Chrysler repaid all of its <b>guaranteed</b> <b>loans,</b> <b>the</b> U. S. government incurred no budgetary cost. Furthermore, the U. S. government received warrants to buy Chrysler stock, which it subsequently sold at auction to Chrysler for $ 311 million. Thus, {{it can be argued that}} the U. S. government made a profit from <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> program. Currently, <b>the</b> Federal Credit Reform Act requires that the reported budgetary cost of a credit program equal the estimated subsidy costs to the taxpayer at the time the credit is provided. For proposed legislation establishing a new credit program, the Congressional Budget Office is responsible for making the initial estimate of the subsidy cost. Once legislation has been enacted, the Office of Management and Budget estimates the subsidy cost on the credit program. An appropriation for the annual subsidy cost of each credit program is made into a budget account called a “credit program” account. Thus, under today’s budgetary rule, legislation providing direct <b>loans</b> or <b>loan</b> <b>guarantees</b> to assist <b>the</b> {{automobile industry}} would require the inclusion of the estimated subsidy cost, which would require an appropriation of budget authority.

5000|$|Chrysler {{struggled}} {{to adapt to}} the changing environment of the 1970s. When consumer tastes shifted to smaller cars in the early 1970s, particularly after the 1973 oil crisis, Chrysler could not meet the demand. Additional burdens came from increased US import competition, and tougher government regulation of car safety, fuel economy, and emissions. As the smallest of the Big 3 US automakers, Chrysler lacked the financial resources to meet all of these challenges. In 1978, Lee Iacocca was brought in to turn the company around, and in 1979 Iacocca sought US government help. Congress later passed <b>the</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Act providing $1.5 billion in <b>loan</b> <b>guarantees.</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Act required that Chrysler also obtain $2 billion in concessions or aid from sources outside the federal government, which included interest rate reductions for $650 million of the savings, asset sales of $300 million, local and state tax concessions of $250 million, and wage reductions of about $590 million along with a $50 million stock offering. $180 million was to come from concessions from dealers and suppliers.|$|R
40|$|In many countries, <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> {{programs}} are {{important elements of}} government policy with respect to {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). If <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> schemes are to be effective, a majority of firms obtaining assistance through such a scheme ought {{not to be able to}} obtain financing from existing sources: a property known as incrementality or additionality. This paper describes a new approach to measuring incrementality. This work uses a two-stage process to estimate <b>the</b> incrementality of <b>loans</b> made under <b>the</b> terms of the Canada Small Business Financing (CSBF) program. First, a logistic regression-based model of loan outcomes (essentially a credit-scoring model) is estimated based on a large representative sample of SMEs. The resulting model was consistent with prior expectations and exhibited high levels of goodness-of-fit. The model was then employed to classify a sample of firms that had received <b>loans</b> under <b>the</b> terms of <b>the</b> <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> scheme. Incremental <b>loans</b> ought to be classified as “turndowns” by the model; hence <b>the</b> proportion of <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> recipients that <b>the</b> model classified as turndowns is a direct measure of incrementality. For <b>the</b> CSBF <b>loan</b> <b>guarantee</b> program incrementality was estimated (with 95 % confidence) as 74. 8 ± 9. 0 %.
