25|$|Many {{participants}} in BMX racing {{have left their}} mark. Most are pure racers while some promoted and sponsored races; others have created unique maneuvers and invented or helped design equipment as well have raced themselves.

25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E

500|$|Animals {{can also}} appear {{coloured}} due to structural colour, {{the result of}} coherent scattering perceived as iridescence. The structures themselves are colourless. [...] Light typically passes through multiple layers and is reflected more than once. The multiple reflections compound one another and intensify the colours. [...] Structural colour differs according to the observer's position whereas pigments appear the same regardless of the angle-of-view. Animals that show iridescence include mother of pearl seashells, fish, and peacocks. [...] <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> examples of animals with this quality, but it is most pronounced in the butterfly family.|$|E
