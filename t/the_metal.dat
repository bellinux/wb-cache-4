30|$|The {{health risk}} of <b>the</b> <b>metals</b> can be {{analysed}} {{by using the}} Risk Assessment Code, RAC (Jain et al. 2007).

50|$|The {{production}} of <b>the</b> <b>metals</b> itself is difficult {{due to their}} reactivity.

25|$|Slater divides <b>the</b> <b>metals</b> 'fairly definitely, {{though not}} {{perfectly}} sharply' into <b>the</b> ordinary <b>metals</b> and <b>the</b> peculiar <b>metals,</b> <b>the</b> latter of which verge on the nonmetals. <b>The</b> peculiar <b>metals</b> occur towards <b>the</b> {{ends of the}} rows of the periodic table and include 'approximately:' gallium, indium, and thallium; carbon, silicon '(both of which have some metallic properties, though we have previously treated them as nonmetals),' germanium and tin; arsenic, antimony, and bismuth; and selenium '(which is partly metallic)' and tellurium. <b>The</b> ordinary <b>metals</b> have centro-symmetrical crystalline structures whereas <b>the</b> peculiar <b>metals</b> have structures involving directional bonding. More recently, Joshua observed that <b>the</b> peculiar <b>metals</b> have mixed metallic-covalent bonding.|$|R
5|$|Plutonium is a {{reactive}} metal. In {{moist air}} or moist argon, <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> oxidizes rapidly, producing {{a mixture of}} oxides and hydrides. If <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> is exposed long enough to {{a limited amount of}} water vapor, a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed. Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of vanadium metal proved difficult. In 1831, Berzelius reported {{the production of}} <b>the</b> <b>metal,</b> but Henry Enfield Roscoe showed that Berzelius had in fact produced the nitride, vanadium nitride (VN). Roscoe eventually produced <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> in 1867 by reduction of vanadium(II) chloride, VCl2, with hydrogen. In 1927, pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium.|$|E

40|$|The {{parts of}} an {{electrical}} contact device are treated by sputter etching to remove <b>the</b> parent <b>metal</b> oxide. Prior to {{exposure of the}} electrodes to any oxygen, a sacrificial metal is sputter deposited on the parts. Preferably this sacrificial metal is one that oxidizes slowly and is readily dissolved by <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal.</b> <b>The</b> sacrificial <b>metal</b> may then be removed from unwanted areas. The remainder of the ring and the probe to be wet by <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal</b> are submerged in <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal</b> or <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal</b> is flushed over these areas, preferably while they are being slightly abraded, unitl all the sacrificial material on these portions is wet by <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal.</b> In doing so <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal</b> dissolves <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>metal</b> and permanently wets <b>the</b> parent <b>metal.</b> Preferred materials used {{in the process and}} for the electrodes of electrical contact devices are high purity (99. 0 %) nickel or AISI type 304 stainless steel for the electrical contact devices, gallium as <b>the</b> liquid <b>metal,</b> and gold as the sacrificial material...|$|R

5|$|Because of Monitors {{advanced}} state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered.

5|$|Chromium, unlike such metals as {{iron and}} nickel, does not suffer from {{hydrogen}} embrittlement.

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in <b>the</b> <b>Metal</b> Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in <b>the</b> <b>Metal</b> Gear series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} the welding {{mechanical}} heterogeneity on the damage evolution of notched round-bar tensile specimens were investigated numerically using a fully coupled elastic-plastic damage finite element method. Some parameters reflecting the welding mechanical heterogeneity such as strength mismatching, rupture strain and weld metal width were taken into account to study their effects on the damage evolution of <b>the</b> weld <b>metal.</b> <b>The</b> calculation {{results show that the}} damage evolution of <b>the</b> weld <b>metal</b> is affected strongly by the welding mechanical heterogeneity. The damage evolution of <b>the</b> weld <b>metal</b> becomes larger with the decrease of both the rupture strain and yielding stress of <b>the</b> base <b>metal.</b> <b>The</b> {{effects of the}} mechanical properties of <b>the</b> base <b>metal</b> on <b>the</b> damage evolution of <b>the</b> weld <b>metal</b> decreases with <b>the</b> increase of <b>the</b> weld <b>metal</b> width...|$|R
50|$|In {{the story}} proper, chemists of the Polesotechnic League {{are working to}} produce {{elements}} that theoretically exist on the 'island of stability' of the periodic table; stable elements that are surrounded by short-lived unstable ones. Progress is nil, when an organization appears, offering commercial quantities of 'supermetals' for sale.

5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. <b>The</b> <b>metal</b> forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>metals</b> can be {{classified}} into groups/types according to several classification systems {{in the context of}} study objectives.
