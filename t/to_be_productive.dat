Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive.</b> To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree from Georgia Tech. On January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to be able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive</b> as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout with speed and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E
5|$|Upon Tallon's {{return to}} Australia, {{he made an}} unbeaten 146 in Bradman's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948. He {{featured}} in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with Geff Noblet, who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively. This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match. Tallon also made seven dismissals for the match. Queensland lost more than they won during the season, but Tallon continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive,</b> scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 dismissals in seven matches.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{his career}} as a fast-medium swing and seam bowler, Pathan broke into the {{national}} team soon after turning 19, and evoked comparisons with Pakistan's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing. In early 2006, Pathan became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match (vs Pakistan at Karachi). However, the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006, Pathan began to steadily lose pace and swing, and his wicket-taking dwindled. Although Pathan's batting continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive,</b> he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006, and by 2007 was no longer in the squad until return in 2007 World Twenty20.|$|E
5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive.</b> Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive</b> workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

40|$|Do wage {{differences}} between workers with {{high and low}} levels of education, between males and females and between workers with different levels of experience reflect differences in productivity? We address this set of questions {{on the basis of a}} data set with variables for individual workers matched with a comprehensive data set for manufacturing plants in Norway for the period 1986 - 93. The results suggest that workers with higher education tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>productive,</b> roughly in accordance to their wage premium. Female workers are cet. par. found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>productive</b> than male workers, and this is reflected in their wages. Experienced workers are on average found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>productive.</b> For workers with 8 to 15 years of experience, the productivity premium exceeds the wage premium, while the opposite is the case for workers with more than 15 years of experience.

25|$|Although most slaves had {{lives that}} were very {{restricted}} {{in terms of their}} movements and agency, exceptions existed to virtually every generalization; for instance, there were also slaves who had considerable freedom in their daily lives: slaves allowed to rent out their labor and who might live independently of their master in cities, slaves who employed white workers, and slave doctors who treated upper-class white patients. After 1820, in response to the inability to import new slaves from Africa and in part to abolitionist criticism, some slaveholders improved the living conditions of their slaves, to encourage them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive</b> and to try to prevent escapes. It was part of a paternalistic approach in the antebellum era that was encouraged by ministers trying to use Christianity to improve the treatment of slaves. Slaveholders published articles in southern agricultural journals to share best practices in treatment and management of slaves; they intended to show that their system was better than the living conditions of northern industrial workers.|$|E

500|$|Another of Przybylo's articles, Asexuality and {{the feminist}} {{politics}} of 'not doing it, published in 2011, takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality. Pryzyblo argues that asexuality {{is made possible}} only through the Western context of [...] "sexual, coital, and heterosexual imperatives". She addresses earlier works by Dana Densmore, Valerie Solanas, and Breanne Fahs, who argued for [...] "asexuality and celibacy" [...] as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy. While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy, she considers blurring the lines between the two <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>productive</b> for a feminist understanding of the topic. In her 2013 article, [...] "Producing Facts: Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex," [...] Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research - that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s, which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality, and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert's 2004 study (see above) and has popularized the subject and made it more [...] "culturally visible". In this article, Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon, {{and continues to be}} critical of its scientific study.|$|E
