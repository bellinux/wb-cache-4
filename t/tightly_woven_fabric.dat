40|$|There was a 1000 -fold {{difference}} between the highest and the lowest mean rate of dispersal of bacteria-carrying particles during exercise {{among a group of}} three male and three female subjects. Differences in the numbers of skin fragments dispersed and in the proportion of these carrying bacteria were almost equally responsible for this. Since there is little {{difference between}} individuals in the rate of skin replacement the differences in the rates of dispersal of skin fragments during exercise must reflect large variations in the amount of skin surface removed in other ways. The skin fragments dispersed had a wide size range extending below 5 micrometer for the minimum projected diameter (MPD). The median MPD was about 20 micrometer with 7 - 10 % less than 10 micrometer. Many of the particles could therefore pass freely through <b>tightly</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> with pores up to 10 - 15 micrometer which might seem to be impenetrable to whole corneocytes, typically larger than 30 X 40 micrometer in the hydrated state...|$|R

Uncoated fabrics constitute the vast majority of fabrics used in curtains, and are composed of a <b>tightly</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> most typically a cotton/polyester blend, which is mostly [...] when viewed in ambient light. Uncoated fabrics provide a reasonable level of heat insulation due to the tight weave of the fabric. However, the fabric itself is typically not thick enough to completely absorb strong light sources. As a result, when curtains made from uncoated fabrics are closed in an attempt to block out direct sunlight, light will still be visible through the curtain.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} ends per inch {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends per inch, which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends per inch will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends per inch (and picks per inch) and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. <b>Tightly</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> shrinks more (and thus the number of ends per inch increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|E

As shown in SEM observed the pesticide-residual state on the surface of three-types protective clothing specimens; before pesticide spraying, 3. 5 hours after spraying, and after 1 time water-cleaning, the pesticide quantities of permeation and residue were detected little bit different states in each other specimens. This results determined that Sontara and Gore-Tex than PU-coated nylon tends to retain more pesticide residue, and Gore-Tex was detected as almost negligible amount of pesticide residue. In other words, regular farm work clothing materials made of light weight, <b>tightly</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> gives worker great protection.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{of skin cancer}} is increasing by epidemic proportions. Basal cell cancer remains the most common skin neoplasm, and simple excision is generally curative. On the other hand, aggressive local growth and metastasis are common features of malignant melanoma, which accounts for 75 percent of all deaths associated with skin cancer. In Croatia only, more than 20. 000 new cases of skin cancer has been diagnosed in 2008 of which melanoma 286 new cases and 118 yearly deaths in men, and 275 new cases and 79 deaths in women population. The back sides in men and women, {{as well as the}} lower limbs in women, are the most common site for melanomas. The primary cause of skin cancer is believed to be a long exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation crossed with the amount of skin pigmentation in the population. There are indications that other parts of solar spectrum (e. g. blue light) might also have effects on skin and eyes. Most people think all clothing will protect them, but that’s not the case. UV clothing can show UV protection, but in the most cases it does not provide full sun screening properties. UV protection ability highly depends on large number of factors such are type of fi ber, fabric surface and construction, type and concentration of dyestuff, fl uorescent whitening agent (FWA), UV-B protective agents, as well as nanoparticles, if applied. For that reason, jeans and <b>tightly</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> offer a very good level of protection. However, on a hot summer day, those aren’t the kinds of clothing people usually reach for.

This dissertation analyzes the textual and argumentative strategies used {{to debate the}} meaning of the past in an attempt to influence the present and future in seventeenth-century British polemic. I focus on two pamphlet wars occurring between 1678 and 1685. The first concerned whether bishops had the right to participate in the trial of one of Charles II's most important ministers. The second arose between a Scottish lawyer and two English clerics when one of the Englishmen tried to debunk the traditional Scottish narrative that their kingdom and royal dynasty had been founded in 330 B. C. I draw upon the well-developed scholarly literature on political and religious ideology for this time period to help explain the conceptual vocabulary used in the arguments and the political theory underlying those ideas. I expand the analysis through a more explicit attention to how writers used histories of certain important institutions to define ideological positions. The role of historical narratives about institutions is an important element of ideological argument, which allows me to develop insights {{about the role of the}} past in how a society defined itself and tried to solve its problems.

Consumers place high value on nonprescription drug therapy; however, self-medicating patients frequently need assistance from a learned intermediary to assure optimal integration of nonprescription drug therapy into the total care regimen. Pharmacist-assisted self-care holds vast potential to serve the public interest, but this expanded practice role will require higher levels of professional practice commitment by American pharmacy. That commitment must be supported by practice-relevant, competency-based, patient-centered college and school of pharmacy curricula and continuing education that assures perpetual intellectual proficiency in nonprescription drug pharmacotherapy. That knowledge and competency must be integrated holistically into the total mix of patient comorbidity and polypharmacy. The pharmacist-assisted self-care business and professional practice model must be further facilitated by state and national pharmacy organizations, chain and independent community pharmacy, pharmacy wholesalers, and others.

The increasing utilisation of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs), such as the Internet, across all sectors of society has led many to conceive of Britain and other advanced industrial economies as Information Societies.
