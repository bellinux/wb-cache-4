5|$|The network began <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> New Zealand in 1997, when {{a number}} of {{licences}} were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $3.6 million. Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting on 30 August 1998, with a nightly local news program in both Waikato and Christchurch. Prime also expanded into Argentina with {{the purchase of the}} Canal 9 network.|$|E

5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|After also {{suffering}} financial {{losses and}} ownership struggles, the Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated {{the team to}} Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's attempts <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the southern United States. Initially replacing the Thrashers in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division, {{as part of a}} realignment to four divisions, the Jets were moved to the Western Conference's Central Division before the 2013–14 season. The Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets were then assigned to the Eastern Conference's Atlantic and Metropolitan divisions, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Carlton Hill's {{pattern of}} {{development}} {{was defined by}} the long-established structure of land ownership around Brighton, whereby land was divided into long, narrow strips with many different owners. This encouraged the development of terraced housing—the predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and high-density rebuilding in the mid-20th century. This work introduced more open space and varied land uses: Brighton Art College was able <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the area, and American Express opened a large, visually dominant headquarters.|$|E

5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
5|$|All Star Pro-Wrestling was {{announced}} in January 1999 as part of Square's desire <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> more diverse game genres on the PlayStation 2 than their usual role-playing games. While DreamFactory developed most of Square's previous fighting games (namely Tobal No. 1, Tobal 2, and Ehrgeiz), Square decided to develop a wrestling game internally as Dream Factory was already working on The Bouncer, another Square title. The game was produced by Yusuke Hirata of Parasite Eve 2 fame, head of Square's Osaka-based fifth production team. The score, which was never released in album form, consists mostly of rock music and was composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Kenichiro Fukui, and Kumi Tanioka.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and to make it easier <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E

5|$|However Butlin did {{not remain}} celebrating for long; he {{required}} a further $2.25 million (2011:£) {{to complete the}} camp, and {{to make matters worse}} American tourists were not used to the holiday camp mentality so the venture held little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe. In the late 1940s Butlin had successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E
5|$|Máel Sechnaill died in 862, and his {{territory}} in Meath was split between two rulers, Lorcán mac Cathail and Conchobar mac Donnchada. Amlaíb and Ímar, now joined in Ireland by their younger brother Auisle, {{sought to make}} use of this change to extend their influence in the lands of the Southern Uí Néill. In 863 the three brothers raided Brega in alliance with Lorcán, and the following year Amlaíb drowned Conchobar at Clonard Abbey. Muirecán mac Diarmata, overking of the Uí Dúnchada, was killed by Vikings in 863, probably by Amlaíb and his kin trying <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> Leinster.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's father, King Thomas, {{had great}} ambitions for him. An attempt <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> Croatia proper by marrying Stephen to a wealthy widow failed, and {{negotiations}} for a marital {{alliance with the}} Sforzas of Milan were abandoned when a more prestigious opportunity presented itself: marriage to the heiress Maria of Serbia in April 1459 made Stephen the ruler of {{the remnants of the}} neighbouring country. The intent was to unite the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Serbian Despotate under Stephen to combat the expanding Ottoman Empire. Stephen's Catholicism made him unpopular in Orthodox Serbia. After ruling it for merely two months, however, Stephen surrendered it to the encroaching Ottoman forces and fled back to his father's court, which earned him the contempt of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus and other Christian rulers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The French did {{not fully}} comply with the {{commerce}} provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico, renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish. Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out.|$|E
5|$|The ability <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> new environments {{throughout}} Africa and, ultimately, the world, {{displays a}} level of adaptability and, consequently, innovativeness that is often seen as characteristic of behavioral modernity. This, however, {{is not the only}} evidence of innovativeness that can be seen in early Homo sapiens. The development of new, regionally relevant tools, such as those used for the collection of marine resources seen at Abdur, Ethiopia, Pinnacle Point Cave, South Africa, and Blombos Cave, South Africa. The use of fire demonstrates another innovative aspect of human behavior when it is used in order to create stronger tools, such as the heated silcrete at Blombos, Howiesons Poort and Still Bay, and the heat treated bone tools from Still Bay.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
5|$|Adamson {{continued}} the company's plans <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> new markets such as universities, gas stations, airports and sports arenas {{with the intention}} of looking into new channels of distribution. Over the next year and a half he worked on a series of initiatives to strengthen the company; in a back to basics campaign, he oversaw a streamlining Burger King's menu and worked to improve and strengthen relations with franchisees. His changes were credited with a 28 percent increase in sales in BK's fiscal year 1995 and same store sales that were up 6 percent. He left in early 1995 when Denny's made him an offer to take the reins of the competitor; he left the company credited with fixing the deficiencies left by Gibbons and was temporarily replaced with David Nash. He was elevated to Chairman in July, with Robert Lowes as CEO. Lowes became chairman in November.|$|E
5|$|By 2006, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas {{managed to}} defeat {{the forces of the}} Sinaloa Cartel in Nuevo Laredo. The latter cartel {{concentrated}} its efforts in northeastern Mexico, becoming dominant there. Los Zetas started <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>into</b> other criminal activities beyond drug trafficking. Under Treviño Morales, the organization smuggled immigrants to the United States, carried out extortions and kidnappings, sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs, and intimidated and/or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them. Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, until March 2007. He was reassigned to the coastal state of Veracruz, shortly after high-ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres (alias Z-14) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race. Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003, he reportedly directed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; when he was extradited to the United States in 2007, Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas' independence from the Gulf Cartel.|$|E
