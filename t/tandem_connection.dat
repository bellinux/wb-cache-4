40|$|Given an {{available}} {{number of}} arithmetic operations per data sample, the <b>tandem</b> <b>connection</b> of a transform source code and a Reed-Solomon channel code is optimized to minimize meansquared error when transmitting Gauss-Markov data across a binary symmetric channel. The {{goal is to}} learn how well-designed systems allocate complexity, i. e. arithmetic operations, between source and channel coding. The tandem system considered here is chosen to be as representative as possible. For the range of source and channel parameters tested, {{it is found that}} when at least moderate complexity is available, a well-designed system allocates 10 to 35 % of its complexity to the source code. 1. Introduction Ever since Shannon showed that one can optimally communicate data over a channel using the <b>tandem</b> <b>connection</b> of independently designed source and channel codes, a division of labor has occurred.

40|$|A {{conventional}} Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) conference bridge {{reduces the}} speech quality due to tandeming the mixed multi-speaker signal with high compression speech codecs. One {{solution is to}} select and forward the compressed signal(s) to the endpoints, where they are decoded and mixed. In such arrange-ments, speaker selection is usually accomplished with an order-based approach which prevents listeners from interrupting the cur-rent speaker(s). This paper presents an alternative in which talking privileges are assigned based on order of activity and signal power. Subjective evaluations indicate that speaker switching is smooth, nearly transparent, and unanimously preferred over a VoIP confer-ence with <b>tandemed</b> <b>connections.</b> 1...|$|R
3000|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} signal based quality estimation algorithms {{perform well}} for traditional telephony applications but {{recent studies have}} found large [...] "per-call" [...] quality estimation errors and error variance [7 – 9]. Large estimation errors limit the use of signal-based methods for online quality monitoring and control purposes [10]. Parameter-based methods, on the other hand, can provide lower per-call quality estimation errors [11, 12] and have been widely deployed in VoIP communication services. The major disadvantage of parameter-based measurement is that distortions that are not captured by the connection parameters are not accounted for. Examples of such distortions include acoustic noise type, temporal clippings, noise suppression artifacts, as well as distortions in <b>tandem</b> <b>connections</b> caused by unidentified equipment and signal conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A hybrid signal-and-link-parametric {{approach}} to speech quality measurement for voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) communications is described. Connection parameters {{are used to}} determine a base quality representative of the transmission link. Degradation factors, computed from perceptual features extracted from the decoded speech signal, are used to quantify distortions not captured by the connection parameters. The algorithm is tested on speech degraded by acoustic noise, temporal clippings, and noise suppression artifacts, thus simulating degradations present in wireless-VoIP <b>tandem</b> <b>connections.</b> Hybrid measurement is shown to overcome the limitations of pure link parametric and pure signal-based measurement methods, resulting in better measurement accuracy for modern VoIP communications. In addition, the proposed algorithm incurs modest computational overhead relative to pure link parametric measurement and attains up to 88 % reduction in processing time relative to the ITU-T standard P. 563 signal-based algorithm.

40|$|The {{separation}} performance using plate-and-frame modules with ion-exchange membranes {{was investigated}} in this study. The proteins employed were lysozyme, BSA and gamma-globulin. In the batch adsorption, the adsorption behaviors of lysozyme onto cation-exchange membranes and BSA onto anion-exchange membranes, both showing the heterogeneous adsorption, could be described more appropriately with the Suen model than the Langmuir model. In the flow process using a single plate-and-frame module. operating conditions greatly influenced the separation performance. At the elution stage, a better performance was achieved by using the cross-flow mode. Other operating conditions such {{as the number of}} membranes in a stack. the pH value at adsorption, and the mixed mode in the membrane stack also affected the separation performance. As to the two-module experiments, two different operation designs were tested: <b>connection</b> in <b>tandem</b> and <b>connection</b> in parallel. The tandem design resulted in a better protein recovery than the parallel design when only one kind of ion-exchange membrane was adopted. Regarding the mixed-mode effect in the tandem design, when the ion-exchange membranes suitable for the target protein were placed in the second module, the target protein could gain a longer time for adsorption and, hence. a better recovery was accomplished.

Limited retransmissions are allowed, and packet loss concealment is utilized. We consider several alternative scenarios, including tandem free operation with G. 711 in both links, G. 711 over UDP in the wired link and G. 711 with unequal error protection (UEP) in the WLAN, and G. 729 in the wired backbone in tandem with G. 711 UEP in the WLAN.

40|$|A new C-band {{accelerator}} {{structure for}} the SuperKEKB injector linac is under development. This structure corresponds to an upstream half part in a <b>tandem</b> <b>connection</b> of two structures. A measure against RF breakdown is required because the upstream structure is exposed to higher RF field {{than that of the}} downstream structure. In order to suppress a RF breakdown around a coupler iris, a fat and smooth iris is adopted for the structure. The coupler dimensions such as an aperture of the iris and a diameter of the coupler cavity is first optimized by computer simulation and then decided by cold model measurements. Electric field symmetry is retained by shifting the coupler cavity from a beam centre. An amount of offset is also decided by simulations. The coupler body is made with a milling machine. A rather rough surface of the inner coupler is finished by an electro-polishing method. This structure will be installed in the beam line of the KEKB injector linac this summer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{nonlinear}} Volterra equalizer is presented. We {{define a}} framework for nonlinear second-order Volterra models, which is applicable to different applications in engineering. We use this framework to define the channel and to model the equalizer. We then solve the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) problem explicitly for the <b>tandem</b> <b>connection</b> of the two second-order Volterra systems. Optimal solutions for a simplified, linear version of the MMSE equalizer are also presented. The novel equalizer was tested when applied to a nonlinear ultra-wideband transmitted reference receiver front end. As a comparison, a least mean squares (LMS) equalizer with a training sequence {{has been used to}} verify the performance of the newly proposed equalizer. The simulation results show that the LMS equalizer is only able to attain the proposed MMSE equalizer after very long training, which might not be desirable in a communication system.

40|$|Importance {{sampling}} is {{a technique}} that is commonly used to speed up Monte Carlo simulation of rare events. However, little is known regarding the design of efficient importance sampling algorithms {{in the context of}} queueing networks. The standard approach, which simulates the system using an a priori fixed change of measure suggested by large deviation analysis, has been shown to fail in even the simplest network setting (e. g., a two-node <b>tandem</b> network). Exploiting <b>connections</b> between importance sampling, differential games, and classical subsolutions of the corresponding Isaacs equation, we show how to design and analyze simple and efficient dynamic importance sampling schemes for general classes of networks. The models used to illustrate the approach include $d$-node tandem Jackson networks and a two-node network with feedback, and the rare events studied are those of large queueing backlogs, including total population overflow and the overflow of individual buffers.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} reducing the hysteresis found in the actuation of most smart materials. They are divided in two groups: systems with no saturation (e. g. piezoelectric actuators), and systems with saturation (e. g. Shape Memory Actuators). For {{the control of the}} first group the concept of phaser is introduced, an operator which shifts the phase of a periodic signal but keeps its magnitude unchanged. Since it is possible to approximate phasers with linear filters, it is possible to design practical compensators. The design of a phaser requires the knowledge of one parameter OE, easily identified from experimental transfer function estimates. For the second group, two phasers are used in a <b>tandem</b> <b>connection.</b> One phaser is designed as described before, and the second is designed so as to vary with the input. This compensation reduces the hysteresis to a single saturation. To show its effectiveness, simulation results are provided using the hystery model, then the method [...] ...|$|E

But the technological process used in sewage works is not able to eliminate these substances and these ones influence the particular items of the environment.

40|$|A Message Channel is dejined as a <b>tandem</b> <b>connection</b> {{of single}} server queues {{in which the}} {{successive}} service times experienced by any particular customer are scaled {{versions of the same}} random variable, and thus it serves as a model for sparsely connected store-and-forward data communications networks (or network segments) where messages typically preserve their lengths as they traverse the system. A particular instance of such a nonstandard queueing model is analyzed in this paper. The system consists of two single server queues in tandem subject to a Poisson arrival process (at the first queue) and providing service according to scaled versions of a sequence of two-level, discrete random variables. A set of recursive equations {{that can be used to}} solve the model for any given scaling factor at the second queue (normalized with respect to the jirst queue service) is explicitly derived. In addition, complete solutions are displayed for several cases of interest, and the equilibrium mean cumulative waiting times for these instances are compared as a method of indicating the impact of the scaling factor on the operation of the system. The extension of several results to systems with more general service time processes is discussed. 1. introduction One of the inherent complexities associated with queueing models for store-and-forward data communications networks arises from the fact that messages typicall...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project {{reported in this}} thesis considers Multiple Distributed Replications in Parallel (MDRIP), a hybrid approach to parallelisation of quantitative stochastic discrete-event simulation. Parallel Discrete-Event Simulation (PDES) generally covers distributed simulation or simulation with replicated trials. Distributed simulation requires model partitioning and synchronisation among submodels. Simulation with replicated trials can be executed on-line by applying Multiple Replications in Parallel (MRIP). MDRIP has been proposed for overcoming problems related to the large size of simulated models and their complexity, {{as well as with}} the problem of controlling the accuracy of the final simulation results. A survey of PDES investigates several primary issues which are directly related to the parallelisation of DES. A secondary issue related to implementation efficiency is also covered. Statistical analysis as a supporting issue is described. The AKAROA 2 package is an implementation of making such supporting issue effortless. Existing solutions proposed for PDES have exclusively focused on collecting of output data during simulation and conducting analysis of these data when simulation is finished. Such off-line statistical analysis of output data offers no control of statistical errors of the final estimates. On-line control of statistical errors during simulation has been successfully implemented in AKAROA 2, an automated controller of output data analysis during simulation executed in MRIP. However, AKAROA 2 cannot be applied directly to distributed simulation. This thesis reports results of a {{research project}} aimed at employing AKAROA 2 for launching multiple replications of distributed simulation models and for on-line sequential control of statistical errors associated with a distributed performance measure; i. e. with a performance measure which depends on output data being generated by a number of submodels of distributed simulation. We report changes required in the architecture of AKAROA 2 to make MDRIP possible. A new MDRIP-related component of AKAROA 2, a distributed simulation engine mdrip engine, is introduced. Stochastic simulation in its MDRIP version, as implemented in AKAROA 2, has been tested in a number of simulation scenarios. We discuss two specific simulation models employed in our tests: (i) a model consisting of independent queues, and (ii) a queueing network consisting of <b>tandem</b> <b>connection</b> of queueing systems. In the first case, we look at the correctness of message orderings from the distributed messages. In the second case, we look at the correctness of output data analysis when the analysed performance measures require data from all submodels of a given (distributed) simulation model. Our tests confirm correctness of our mdrip engine design in the cases considered; i. e. in models in which causality errors do not occur. However, we argue that the same design principles should be applicable in the case of distributed simulation models with (potential) causality errors...|$|E
