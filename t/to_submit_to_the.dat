5|$|The law had its detractors, {{even among}} those groups {{protected}} by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, they were being required <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pope, whom they {{considered to be the}} antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church.|$|E
5|$|To {{solve these}} {{problems}} Michael Palaeologus began consolidating his rule; he had the younger co-emperor John IV blinded, which resulted in much resentment. To counter this, the Byzantine Emperor installed a new Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanus III, ordering him to lift an excommunication that had been placed against him by the former Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos and <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authority of Rome in order to alleviate the Latin threat.|$|E
5|$|After Henry of Anjou's {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of England as Henry II in 1154, Foliot persuaded the Earl of Hereford <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new king's demand that he return the custody of certain royal castles to the king. In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to Pope Alexander III, whom the king had just recognised as pope instead of Alexander's rival, Victor IV, intimating that the canonisation of King Edward the Confessor, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor Innocent II, might be warranted {{as a reward for}} Henry's recognition of Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Fuad Pasha advised Karam {{to pursue}} and capture Shahin, while the British consul communicated {{his desire to}} see Karam restore the Khazens to their former {{position}} in Keserwan. Shahin ultimately reconciled with Karam on 12 April under the mediation of the French general Charles de Beaufort. Shahin agreed <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Qaimaqamate's authority without conditions. Later in 1861, Shahin relinquished the republic that he established in Keserwan. Subsequent to his retirement from politics, Shahin served as a judicial official in Rayfoun. There, in 1895, he died in relative obscurity. He left no memoirs {{about his role in}} the civil war.|$|E
5|$|However, Ladislaus {{could not}} restore royal power in Hungary. A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus {{consolidate}} his authority, but the prelate {{was shocked at}} the presence of thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary. Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused to obey the legate's demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} and winter of 1382, Flanders had been invaded by Charles VI of France. Philip Van Artevelde had fallen at the Battle of Roosebeke {{and the country}} had been {{compelled}} <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French king, who obliged all the conquered towns to recognise Clement VII. In response to events in Flanders, Pope Urban issued bulls for the proclamation of a crusade, choosing Bishop Despenser to lead a campaign against the followers of Clement VII in Flanders. He granted Despenser extraordinary powers for the fulfillment of his mission and plenary indulgence to those who should take part in or contribute support to it.|$|E

5|$|Next was {{the main}} event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against The Great Khali. Khali {{attacked}} Cena early in the match, but Cena countered and gained the advantage. Cena performed a diving legdrop bulldog and followed by putting Khali in the STFU. Cena forced Khali <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hold, but Khali's foot was under the rope, meaning Cena should have broken the hold. The referee, however, did not see this and declared Cena the winner. Cena retained the WWE Championship and gained possession of the belt, which Khali had kayfabe stolen prior to the event.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} {{and this time}} Venetian rule would last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with the Pope and Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E

5|$|Several of the Tarim Basin oasis states {{switched}} {{their allegiance}} from the Tang Dynasty to the Western Turks. The oasis states Kashgar and Khotan {{surrendered to the}} Chinese in 632, as did the kingdom of Yarkand in 635. Tang military campaigns expanded further west against the remaining kingdoms of the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang beginning in 640. The king of Gaochang refused <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tang Dynasty as a suzerain. In 638, Emperor Taizong ordered a campaign led by general Hou Junji to invade Gaochang. Tang troops arrived in 640 and annexed the kingdom. A Western Turk army, sent to support Gaochang, retreated as the Tang forces approached.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} for the World Tag Team Championships between La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) against Edge and Chris Benoit, the two {{individuals}} who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight championship. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all the superstars were {{able to participate in}} the match. Edge abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle La Résistance by himself. Benoit fought them off {{and he was able to}} get the upper hand over Grenier. The match concluded with Benoit forcing Conway <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crippler Crossface to win the title for his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship {{involving}} reigning champion Chris Benoit, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels, which Benoit won after forcing Michaels <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sharpshooter.

5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Backlash was between Chris Benoit, Triple H, and Shawn Michaels over the World Heavyweight Championship. Chris Benoit won the title one month prior at WrestleMania XX when he {{defeated}} Michaels and then-champion Triple H in a Triple Threat match. Benoit won the match by forcing Triple H <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crippler Crossface. The following night on Raw, Benoit and Michaels defeated Evolution (Randy Orton, Ric Flair, and Batista) in a 3-on-2 Handicap tag team match. Benoit and Michaels won the match after Benoit forced Batista <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sharpshooter. On March 22, Triple H was drafted {{over to the}} SmackDown! brand, and Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced that Michaels would receive a World title match against Benoit at Backlash. Four days later on the March 25 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown! General Manager Kurt Angle announced that Triple H had been traded back to Raw in exchange for The Dudley Boyz and Booker T. The next week on Raw, Bischoff made the one-on-one World Heavyweight Championship match between champion Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels, a Triple Threat match also involving Triple H.|$|E

Lashley won the match by pinning Shane McMahon; however, he did not win the title since he did not pin the champion, Vince McMahon.|$|E
5|$|Among Mahler's fellow {{students}} at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable <b>to</b> <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, {{and most of the}} audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.|$|E
