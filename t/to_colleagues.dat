While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal <b>to</b> <b>colleagues,</b> advising them of Miami's need for a state university.

40|$|Individuals {{engage in}} job {{crafting}} {{to create a}} better fit between their job and their preferences, skills, and abilities. However, the individual focus may overlook the impact of job crafting on the job context or well-being of colleagues. Therefore, an important question that is addressed {{in this study is}} whether the crafting of one person is related to the job characteristics and well-being of a colleague. This study explores the potential negative effects of a seemingly positive strategy for the individual on a colleague. Namely, we predict that when employees decrease their hindering job demands, their colleagues {{will be more likely to}} report a higher workload and more conflict. In turn, we hypothesise that colleague reports of workload and conflict are related <b>to</b> <b>colleague</b> burnout. Data were collected among 103 dyads and analyzed with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. The results largely supported the hypothesised relationships: Decreasing hindering job demands was positively related <b>to</b> <b>colleague</b> workload and conflict, which, in turn, related positively <b>to</b> <b>colleague</b> burnout. These findings suggest that proactively decreasing hindering job demands not only relates to personal job experiences, but also <b>to</b> <b>colleague</b> job characteristics and well-being...|$|R

25|$|By this time, Taylor's {{relationship}} with Khánh had already broken {{down over the}} issue of the HNC, and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to an expansion of the war. Knowing that he was close to being forced out, Khánh tried to start negotiations with the communists, but this only increased the plotting. In early February, Taylor told Kỳ, who then passed on the message <b>to</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the junta, that the United States was “in no way propping up General Khanh or backing him in any fashion.” Taylor thought his message had been effective.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{price of}} the event was {{reportedly}} £20million. The Australian newspaper Herald Sun estimated A$32million for security and A$800,000 for flowers. Estimates of {{the cost to the}} economy of extra public holidays, such as that allowed for the wedding, vary between £1.2billion and £6billion. The British government tourist authority VisitBritain predicted the wedding would trigger a tourism boom that would last several years, eventually pulling in an additional 4million visitors and generating £2billion. However, VisitBritain's head of research and forecasting, David Edwards, suggested <b>to</b> <b>colleagues</b> two days after the engagement was announced that the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism. He noted that the number of visitors to Britain was down significantly in July 1981, when Prince Charles and Diana were married, from the same period in other years, and also July 1986, when Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were married, was down from July 1985.|$|E

500|$|Bo spent {{seventeen}} {{years in the}} city of Dalian, a lengthy term in comparison <b>to</b> <b>colleagues</b> of the same rank, who are often transferred to different locales throughout their careers. Despite the accompanying economic growth and rise in living standards, Bo's tenure in Dalian has sometimes been criticized as having been too focused on aesthetic development projects such as expansive boulevards, monuments, and large public parks. To make way for his large-scale projects, Bo's administration moved large numbers of local residents from downtown areas into new homes in the city's outskirts. Dalian's greenery was dubbed [...] "Xilai Grass". He also reputedly had a remote control in the Mayor's office for the fountains on the city's main square. In addition, he spearheaded the construction of a huabiao in the city. In 2000, Bo was frontrunner for the post of Mayor of Shenzhen, based on his success in making Dalian the [...] "Hong Kong of the North".

500|$|Bare-faced Messiah {{covers a}} period from 1911, when Hubbard was born, {{to his death}} in 1986, with some {{additional}} background on his family history. It describes his early life, his success as a science fiction writer in the 1930s and 1940s, his military career during the Second World War, the rise of Dianetics and Scientology in the 1950s, his journeys at sea with his followers in the 1960s and early 1970s and his legal problems and period as a recluse from the mid-1970s to 1986. The author draws on previously unpublished materials, such as Hubbard's teenage diaries and personal correspondence <b>to</b> <b>colleagues,</b> employers and the FBI, as well as government documents like Hubbard's military service record and FBI file. In an [...] "author's note", Miller writes that the book {{would have been impossible}} without the Freedom of Information Act. Among the private papers quoted in the book are a letter written by Hubbard to the FBI denouncing his wife as a Soviet spy, another in which he tells his daughter Alexis that he is not really her father and an internal letter in which he suggests that Scientology should pursue religious status for business reasons. Other sources used by Miller include news articles and comments from interviews that he conducted with Hubbard's old acquaintances and family members.|$|E

Taylor thought his message had been effective and sent a cable to Washington claiming his words [...] had [...] "fallen on fertile ground". He then had the message repeated to seven other key generals. At this stage, Taylor and his staff in Saigon thought highly of three officers as possible replacements for Khánh: Thiệu, the commander of II Corps Có, and the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Admiral Chung Tấn Cang. A US Defense Department report described Có as an [...] "outstanding officer ... friendly to Americans" [...] and deemed Cang [...] "a good leader ... anti-communist; friendly towards U.S". Thiệu was quoted in a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report as being described by an unnamed American official as [...] "intelligent, highly ambitious, and likely to remain a coup plotter with the aim of personal advancement". At the same time, the CIA was aware that Có had become disillusioned with Khánh and had stopped attending junta meetings after Khánh accused him of [...] "having been bought off by the Americans". Taylor also did not rule out supporting a return to power for Khiêm, despite having agreed with Khánh's decision to exile him after the September 1964 coup.|$|E

500|$|Playing for MCC {{under the}} {{captaincy}} of Arthur Gilligan, Kilner made 103 against Western Australia on his maiden first-class appearance in Australia. He continued to show good all-round {{form in the}} less important, non first-class matches, but in first-class matches {{leading up to the}} Tests he was less successful. Kilner passed fifty runs just once after his century and with the ball took one wicket in 81 overs during seven innings. He did not play in the first two Test matches, both of which were lost by England, but was selected for the third when the selectors altered the bowling attack. During the match, a series of injuries <b>to</b> <b>colleagues</b> left Kilner with a heavy workload. Australia batted first and scored 489, a total which looked unlikely when they lost three wickets for 22 and later six wickets for 119. England's pace bowlers, Gilligan and Maurice Tate, had to leave the field injured, allowing Australia to recover; later the spinner Tich Freeman hurt his wrist and could not bowl. The only fit front-line bowlers remaining were Kilner and Frank Woolley. England fielded for nearly nine hours, and Kilner bowled 56 eight-ball overs to take four for 127, his first wicket in Test matches being Arthur Richardson. Given the injuries, Gilligan later said Kilner gave [...] "a truly great performance". England could not match Australia's total, scoring only 365, but when the hosts batted again, rain fell and affected the pitch, making it responsive to spin bowling. Australia lost their last seven wickets for 39 runs in an hour and Kilner took four for 14 in his final spell of bowling to end with four for 51. Needing 375 to win, Kilner scored 24 but England fell just short to lose by 11 runs. Consequently, Australia took an unbeatable 3–0 series lead. Between the third and fourth matches in the series, Kilner recorded good bowling performances, with five for 35 against Tasmania and match figures of ten for 66 against Victoria, and kept his place for the final two Tests.|$|E
