40|$|Because {{microorganisms}} {{are sensitive}} to temperature, ongoing global <b>warming</b> is predicted <b>to</b> influence microbial community structure and function. We used large-scale warming experiments established at two sites near {{the northern and southern}} boundaries of US eastern deciduous forests to explore how microbial communities and their function respond <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> at sites with differing climatic regimes. Soil microbial community structure and function responded <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> at the southern but not the northern site. However, changes in microbial community structure and function at the southern site did not result in changes in cellulose decomposition rates. While most global change models rest on the assumption that taxa will respond similarly <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> across sites and their ranges, these results suggest that the responses of microorganisms <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> may be mediated by differences across the geographic boundaries of ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Studying soil carbon (C) {{losses and}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{feedbacks}} to the atmosphere under global climate change allows us to quantify and understand how our ecosystems are responding <b>to</b> <b>warming.</b> <b>To</b> accurately project {{the fate of the}} terrestrial C, we need to incorporate processes that are pivotal in shaping microbial communities that are responsible of processing the C in the soil. One of these processes is the evolutionary adaptation <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> which has been difficult to study because it may only be noticeable on the long term. The goal of my dissertation was to examine soil microbes, their response and adaptation <b>to</b> <b>warming,</b> and consequences <b>to</b> the C cycle. In Chapter 1, I synthesized data from 25 field <b>warming</b> experiments <b>to</b> assess the effect of microbial responses ─relevant to the C cycle─ <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> over time. I found that the effect of soil respiration decreases as warming progresses and explored the potential microbial-related causes of this decrease. In my second chapter, I experimentally adapted the model fungus Neurospora discreta <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> and analyzed physiological traits important for the C cycle before and after adaptation. I discovered that when N. discreta adapts <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> it allocates more resources to increase its fitness by producing more spores at the expense of biomass. I found that adaptation <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> is accompanied by increases in CO 2 respiration potentially due to higher production of energetically expensive spores. In this chapter, I discussed the potential consequences for the terrestrial C if the soil microbial community adapts in a similar manner as N. discreta. Finally, in my third chapter, I quantified decomposition of specific C fractions in litter in a long-term field warming experiment. I found that the proportional losses of recalcitrant vs non-recalcitrant C was higher in <b>warmed</b> plots compared <b>to</b> control plots. Similarly, the ratio of microbial extracellular enzyme activities responsible for breaking down recalcitrant C was higher under <b>warming</b> compared <b>to</b> enzymes that break down non-recalcitrant C. Collectively, in my dissertation research I integrated the process of evolutionary adaptation of microbes <b>to</b> <b>warming,</b> thus providing an overview of the potential long-term effects of <b>warming</b> <b>to</b> decomposition and the C cycle...|$|R
5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps.

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice.

Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} if the response of arctic plants <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> is consistent across species, locations and time. This study examined the impact of experimental warming and natural temperature variation on plants at Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska beginning in 1994. We considered observations of plant performance collected from 1994 - 2000 "short-term" and those from 2007 - 2012 "long-term". The plant traits reported are the number of inflorescences, inflorescence height, leaf length, and day of flower emergence. These traits can inform us about larger scale processes such as plant reproductive effort, plant growth, and plant phenology, and therefore provide valuable insight into community dynamics, carbon uptake, and trophic interactions. We categorized traits of all species monitored at each site into temperature response types. We then compared response types across traits, plant growth forms, sites, and over time to analyze the consistency of plant response <b>to</b> <b>warming.</b> Graminoids were the most responsive <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> and showed a positive response to temperature, while shrubs were generally the least responsive. Almost half (49 %) of response types (across all traits, species, and sites combined) changed from short-term to long-term. The percent of plants responsive <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> decreased from 57 % (short-term) to 46 % (long-term). These results indicate that the response of plants <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> varies over time and has diminished overall in recent years...|$|R

The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> the engine to operating temperature.

40|$|By {{the year}} 2100, it is {{projected}} that average global temperatures will increase by ~ 4 C. Shifts in species distributions have been evidenced {{as a common}} response <b>to</b> climate <b>warming</b> across taxonomic groups with migration to higher latitudes and elevations in response <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> being common. Species responses <b>to</b> climate <b>warming</b> can {{be influenced by the}} local adaptations of their populations. I hypothesized that populations of M. canadense from warmer locations would respond negatively <b>to</b> <b>warming,</b> while populations from cooler sites would exhibit neutral or positive responses <b>to</b> <b>warming.</b> Maianthemum canadense is a species that is associated with cool, moist microsites across its distribution. To examine the role of local adaptation within the context of projected climate warming across a wide-ranging species in the Appalachian region, I grew Maianthemum canadense individuals in controlled-environment growth chambers that simulated current and future projected average growing season temperatures throughout the sampled range. The individuals were propagated from rhizomes collected from distinct naturally occurring populations of this species in Tennessee, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. As such, populations from warmer locations may already be experiencing the high temperature range limit for this species. I used a two-way factorial design with temperature assigned to growth chambers as main plots and population as a split-plot factor within chambers. Findings suggest that M. canadense does not respond well <b>to</b> <b>warming</b> overall at the species level and that populations in warmer parts of the current range could be most negatively impacted by future climate warming. Since M. canadense is a common understory monocot herb with wide distribution throughout the Appalachian region, and as such, could represent the responses of similar species as a response <b>to</b> future <b>warming...</b>|$|R

5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern margins of the sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern margins of the Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air <b>to</b> <b>warm</b> and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E
