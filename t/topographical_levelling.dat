40|$|Persistent virus {{infections are}} {{discussed}} from the virus {{point of view}} in terms of the bodily sites in which the infection persists. Glands and body surfaces are thought to be significant because they give the virus protection at the <b>topographical</b> <b>level</b> from immune forces, and because they are appropriate sites for the shedding of virus to the exterior. Germ cells are relevant sites because infection can thus be transmitted vertically from generation to generation in the host. The central nervous system, however, is generally a 'dead end' from which there is no shedding to the exterior. Persistance in blood may be relevant when continued arthropod transmission becomes possible. Most persistent viruses infect lymphoreticular tissues, and this is interpreted by suggesting that it results in an impaired immune response to the infecting virus, which in turn favours persistence. It is suggested that the biological function of virus transformation and the integration of viral into host cell DNA is that it enables the infection to persist in the host and undergo reactivation. Papovaviruses, adenoviruses and oncornaviruses are considered from this point of view...|$|R
50|$|The {{title was}} {{originally}} built and demonstrated with touchscreen features for the Wii U, but the developers found that {{looking away from}} the main screen distracted from the game. The features were removed when the game moved to tandem development across the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. The Wii U GamePad also affected the game's animations. Though the series protagonist Link is canonically left-handed, he is right-handed in the game to match the GamePad's control scheme, which has its sword-swinging buttons on its right side. The Switch version performs better than the Wii U release when docked to a television, though when undocked, both run at the same resolution. The Switch version also has higher-quality environmental sounds. On the game's art style and direction, Aonuma stated that it was inspired by gouache and en plein air art to help identify the vast world.

The objective {{of this study was}} to report patients with different lesions of central origin clinically presenting as wrist drop and with a semiology similar to that produced by peripheral lesions of the radial nerve at different <b>topographical</b> <b>levels.</b> Methods: This is a case series study of patients presenting with wrist drop during the acute phase of stroke who were assessed by clinical examination and CT and MRI brain scans. Results: Three cases presenting as monoparesis were evaluated. In all patients, the MRI revealed restricted diffusion in the pre- and post-central gyrus. Electromyography showed that the functionality of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves were intact in all three cases. The monoparesis resolved completely within 1 month of rehabilitation therapy, and no evidence of recurrent or new events was reported during the 6 -month follow-up after stenting. Conclusion: The central message of this study is that when acute onset symptoms are present in a relatively old patient with vascular risk factors, stroke should be considered as the possible aetiology until proven otherwise, and the appropriate steps should be taken to avoid a delay in the treatment and to improve outcomes...|$|R

The objective of this literature review was to highlight the main stages and precise time ranges of human upper lip development, as well as to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of normal morphogenesis and possible congenital malformations. The structures {{of the head and neck}} arise from the lateral portion of the neural tube, which forms five pairs of branchial arches. Recent studies have identified various molecular pathways (including Bmp, Fgf and Shh signaling) and genetic mechanisms in human face development. Primordial structures of the upper lip begin to appear early within the 6 th week of ontogenesis; their development involves a number of highly coordinated, genetically programmed ontogenetic mechanisms that include growth and expansion of the facial prominences, programmed cell death, active fusion and breakdown of the epithelial seam between the initially freely maxillary, medial nasal, and lateral nasal processes. Defects of epithelial and mesenchymal fusion during upper lip formation result in orofacial cleft.

40|$|International audienceVariation of {{dead wood}} decay rates among {{tropical}} trees remains {{one source of}} uncertainty in global models of the carbon cycle. Taking advantage of a broad forest plot network surveyed for tree mortality over a 23 -year period, we measured the remaining fraction of boles from 367 dead trees from 26 neotropical species widely varying in wood density (0. 23 – 1. 24 g cm- 3) and tree circumference at death time (31. 5 – 272. 0 cm). We modeled decay rates within a Bayesian framework assuming a first order differential equation to model the decomposition process and tested {{for the effects of}} forest management (selective logging vs. unexploited), of mode of death (standing vs. downed) and of <b>topographical</b> <b>levels</b> (bottomlands vs. hillsides vs. hilltops) on wood decay rates. The general decay model predicts the observed remaining fraction of dead wood (R 2 = 60 %) with only two biological predictors: tree circumference at death time and wood specific density. Neither selective logging nor local topography had a differential effect on wood decay rates. Including the mode of death into the model revealed thatstanding dead trees decomposed faster than downed dead trees, but the gain of model accuracy remains rather marginal. Overall, these results suggest that the release of carbon from tropical dead trees to the atmosphere can be simply estimated using tree circumference at death time and wood density...|$|R

Such situation creates unpleasant and discomfort living condition to the households. This study investigates performance of waste water supply system within Ikuti Sub-Urbs and proposes an innovative concrete trapezoidal channel that would hygienically convey wastes to a disposal unit. A survey was conducted to outline waste water performance issues: i. e. waste water generation, awareness and consciousness by the community about these waste water’s effects, identifying current initiatives by respondents and identifying distances between houses together with the <b>topographical</b> <b>levels</b> of the underlying ground.

Graft integration was verified by turning behavior tests and from the <b>topographical</b> <b>levels</b> of the DA transporter, tagged autoradiographically with 3 nM [3 H]GBR 12935 (average increase in grafted dorsal striatum compared to nongrafted side, 60 %). Autoradiography of 80 nM [3 H]CNQX and 100 nM NMDA-sensitive [3 H]glutamate binding was carried out to visualize the topography of non-NMDA and NMDA receptors, respectively, in +/+ mice and in recipient weaver mutants 3 months after grafting. Increases of 30 % or more were found for [3 H]CNQX binding in the dorsal nongrafted weaver striatum compared to +/+, and a further 6 - 9 % increase in grafted weaver compared to nongrafted side. The added increase of non-NMDA receptors in the transplanted striatum might be explained by a presence of such receptors on DA presynaptic endings of graft origin. A 20 % increase in NMDA-sensitive [3 H]glutamate binding was measured in the dorsal nongrafted weaver striatum compared to +/+. NMDA-sensitive [3 H]glutamate binding in the transplanted side of weaver mutants tended to be slightly higher {{in all areas of}} the striatal complex compared to the nongrafted side, without reaching conventional levels of statistical significance. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry with synthetic 32 P-labeled oligonucleotide probes, we investigated RNA transcripts encoding the four AMPA receptor subunits. RNA transcripts in the striatum are seen with a decreasing signal intensity in the following order: GluRB > GluRA > GluRC > GluRD. The weaver caudate-putamen shows a 12 % increase in GluRA subunit mRNA compared to +/+, whereas mesencephalic neuron transplantation leads to slight increases (3 %) in the levels of GluRB mRNA in the nucleus accumbens. The results are placed {{in the context of the}} important interaction between the converging glutamatergic corticostriatal and the DAergic nigrostriatal pathways in controlling the functional output of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and in experimental models of DA deficiency.

Topos de elevações, onde os solos são caracterizados pela unicidade de {{material}} de origem, podem constituir ambiente especial para estudos de gênese de solos e datações de eventos cíclicos relacionados com a dinâmica do clima regional. Depois de um levantamento detalhado de solos no topo da Serra São José (Prados - Minas Gerais), dois perfis de solo (P 1 e P 2), originados de metarenitos da Formação Tiradentes e caracterizados por deposições sucessivas de camadas arenosas alternadas com camadas arenosas enriquecidas com matéria orgânica, foram estudados, com intuito de encontrar testemunhos de paleoambientes. O pequeno platô localiza-se a 1. 350 m acima do nível de mar e 350 m acima do nível topográfico regional dominante. No P 1, foram identificadas trinta e três camadas enriquecidas com matéria orgânica, alternadas com camadas de areia. Três camadas no P 1 (20 - 30, 70 - 80 e 100 - 110 cm), com conteúdo de C orgânico respectivamente de 0. 5, 7 e 1 dag kg- 1, apresentam idades radiocarbônicas The {{diversity of}} ecosystems in southeastern Brazil {{can not always}} be related to edaphic, geomorphologic, or hydrologic factors. Mountain summits, where soils are characterized by common parent material, offer a special environment for studies of soil genesis and dating of cyclic events related to regional climate dynamics. After a detailed investigation of soils from the São José Hills (Prados - Minas Gerais State, Brazil), two soil profiles (P 1 and P 2) originated from arenite of the Tiradentes Formation were studied. They are characterized by successive depositions of sandy layers alternated with layers of sand enriched with organic matter. The study site lies 1, 350 m above sea level and 350 m above the dominant <b>topographical</b> <b>level</b> of the region. Thirty-three layers with organic matter, alternated with sand layers, were identified in P 1. Three layers in P 1 (20 - 30, 70 - 80, and 100 - 110 cm depth) with an organic C content of 0, 5, 7, and 1 dag kg- 1, respectively, present radiocarbon (14 C) ages < 40, 180 ± 60, and 350 ± 80 years BP, respectively, and deposition rates of 0. 177 cm year- 1 at depths between 110 and 170 cm and of 0. 357 cm year- 1 between 70 and 20 cm layer. In P 2, the layers enriched with organic matter are thicker (between 10 and 130 mm), with abrupt discontinuity. They lie between 20 - 30, 80 - 90 110 - 120, and 170 - 180 cm deep, have a C content of 3, 2. 5, 21, and 1. 5 dag kg- 1, and a 14 C age of 3580 ± 80, 3750 ± 80, 21210 ± 180, and 24060 ± 130 year- 1 BP, respectively. Their deposition rates are 0. 352 cm year- 1 between 20 and 80 cm, 0. 002 cm year- 1 between 80 and 110 cm and 0. 021 cm year- 1 at depths between 110 and 170 cm. In both soil profiles, the C/N ratio increases with depth and age. The amount of Ti and Zr, elements of low mobility, are higher in the oldest profile layers, while Cu and Pb are more concentrated in the layers higher in organic matter. A plant fragment (diameter 5 cm, 62 cm long) found {{at the bottom of}} P 2 dated back to 32220 ± 290 years BP, and is associated with the beginning of this profile formation. The soils at the summit of São José Hills had its origin in the Tiradentes Formation without contribution of other geologic material. Rain water is the main factor that adds energy to this environmental energy. Therefore, soil formation is related to climate attributes. P 1 is a holocenic (Fluvic Entisol) soil, formed by episodic depositions of sand, alternated with sand enriched with organic matter. The formation of P 2 (Paleosol) began in the Pleistocene and lasted until the Holocene. The morphology of its buried peat layers is related to oscillations of the water surface of a lake, reflecting drier and more humid climate phases. The assessed radiocarbonic ages are related to Pleistocene and Holocene climate alternations in P 2 and holocenic in P 1. Profile P 2 is an appealing site for palynological studies, where ecotypes that were present in the area beginning in the late Pleistocene can be identified and related to the palaeoclimates...|$|R
40|$|A surface forces {{apparatus}} (SFA) {{was used}} to measure the intermolecular forces between a biodegradable demulsifier (ethyl cellulose, EC) and asphaltenes immobilized individually on molecularly smooth mica surfaces in an organic solvent. A steric repulsion on approach between the immobilized EC layers and asphaltenes was measured despite strong adhesion (Fad/R ≈ − 2 mN/m; Wad = 0. 42 mJ/m 2) during retraction. The measured adhesion was attributed to the interpenetration and tangling of aliphatic branches of swollen asphaltenes and solvated chains of EC macromolecules. Competitive adsorption of EC on/in immobilized asphaltene layers was confirmed by combining SFA force measurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Following the injection of EC-in-toluene solution, an immediate (< 5 min) increase in the confined layer thickness of the immobilized asphaltene layers was measured. Irreversibly adsorbed asphaltenes were displaced by EC macromolecules through binding with unoccupied surface sites on mica, followed by the spreading of EC across the mica substrate due to increased surface activity governed by the higher number of hydroxyl groups per EC molecule. AFM imaging confirmed that the increase in confined layer thickness resulted from the formation of larger asphaltene aggregates/clusters protruding from the mica substrate. Molecular <b>level</b> <b>topographical</b> images showed that the asphaltenes were not resolvated in the organic phase but self-associated as the EC macromolecules spread across the hydrophilic mica substrate. The results from this study provide not only fundamental insights into the basic interaction mechanisms of asphaltenes with EC macromolecules as a demulsifier in organic media but also directions toward enhancing demulsification of water-in-oil emulsions...|$|R
40|$|In Mediterranean {{areas the}} {{dynamics}} of gully development act as an important indicator of desertification. However, {{little is known about}} the influence of climate and land-use changes, and almost no field data exist to assess the sensitivity of a landscape to gully erosion. Two important components of gully erosion studies are the prediction of where gullies begin and where they end. To address some of these issues, topographical thresholds for gully initiation and sedimentation in six different Mediterranean study areas were established. Field measurements of local soil surface slope (S) and drainage-basin area (A) at the point of initiation of ephemeral gullies in intensively cultivated fields (five datasets) and permanent gullies in rangelands (three datasets) were carried out. A negative power relationship of the form S = aA(-b) was fitted through all datasets, and defined as the mean topographical threshold for gullying in the respective area. Topographically controlled slopes of sedimentation at the gully bottom were also measured. Compared to theoretical relationships for channel initiation by overland flow, relatively low values for b are obtained, suggesting a dominance of overland flow and an influence of subsurface flow. The influence of landsliding at steeper slopes appeared from the flattening of the overall negative trend in the higher slope range (S > 0. 30) of the integrated dataset. Comparing the threshold lines of our datasets to the average trend lines through data found in literature revealed that vegetation type and cover could better explain differences in <b>topographical</b> thresholds <b>level</b> than climatic conditions. In cultivated fields, soil structure and moisture conditions, as determined by the rainfall distribution, are critical factors influencing topographical thresholds rather than daily rainfall amounts of the gully-initiating events. In rangelands, vegetation cover at the time of incision appears to be the most important factor differentiating between topographical thresholds, overruling the effect of average annual rainfall amounts. Soil texture and rock fragment cover contributed little to the explanation of the relative threshold levels. Differences in regression slopes (b) between the S-A relationships found in this study have been attributed to the soil characteristics in the different study areas, determining the relative importance of subsurface flow and Hortonian overland flow. Sedimentation slopes where both ephemeral and permanent gullies end were generally high because of the high rock fragment content of the transported sediment. A positive relationship was found between the rock fragment content at the apex of the sedimentation fan and the slope of the soil surface at this location.
