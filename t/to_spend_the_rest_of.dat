5|$|While {{shedding}} {{much of the}} blood's liquid facilitates flight takeoff, the bat {{still has}} added almost 20–30% of its body weight in blood. To take off from the ground, the bat generates extra lift by crouching and flinging itself into the air. Typically, within two hours of setting out in search of food, the common vampire bat returns to its roost and settles down <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the night digesting its meal.|$|E
5|$|Orhan, the Ottoman Turkish {{prince of}} Bithynia {{was married to}} Theodora, {{daughter}} of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. The Greek clergy believed that the marriage of a Christian princess and a prominent Muslim would increase the region's power. Orhan already had several other wives, and although Theodora was permitted to keep her religion, she was required <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> her life in an Islamic harem. Kantakouzenos hoped that Orhan would become his ally in any future wars, but Orhan, like his fellow Turks, became his enemy in the Genoese war. As part of the alliance, the Ottoman prince was permitted to sell the Christians he had captured at Constantinople as slaves in the public market.|$|E

5|$|After sending Stewie out {{for more}} paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then complains that he will now have <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> {{his life in a}} wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E

Steve arrives shortly {{thereafter}} and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him.

Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E
5|$|Gower {{remained}} {{in command of}} Neptune until his promotion to rear-admiral of the white, at which point Herbert Sawyer became her acting-captain. Sawyer was in command until 22 January 1799, and Gower left her on 28 February 1799. Command of the ship formally passed to Captain James Vashon on 5 March 1799. The first half of 1799 was spent with the Channel Fleet, and in June Neptune was one of 15 ships of the line assigned to join Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's fleet in the Mediterranean. The squadron, commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, rendezvoused with Keith's force at Menorca on 7 July, bringing the British fleet in the Mediterranean up to 31 ships. Keith intended to intercept a large Franco-Spanish force of 42 ships under Admirals Étienne Eustache Bruix and Jose Mazarredo, {{and set out to}} sea on 10 July. Bruix' expedition evaded Keith, and reached the safety of Brest on 9 August.

50|$|The {{second part}} of the story skips ahead to the far future when {{humanity}} has colonized the stars. Trevindor the Philosopher commits the unprecedented act of challenging the political and philosophical orthodoxy of this peaceful but uniform galaxy-spanning civilization, where dissent, criminality, violence and any form of conflict, are all virtually unknown. Instead of promising to give up his unorthodoxy, Trevindor chooses exile into future time, when the Sun is entering its red giant phase, and Earth is a parched, virtually lifeless desert. Trevindor explores the dying Earth, and has almost resigned himself <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life in isolation, when he finds the Master's hibernaculum, now exposed on the surface by millennia of erosion.|$|R

5|$|In 1882 Stowe {{purchased}} {{a plot of}} land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with plants and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across. She died in 1896.|$|E
5|$|On {{the deserted}} island with the {{surviving}} crew, Judy {{managed to find}} a fresh water source saving them all. They {{made their way to}} Singkep in the Dutch East Indies and afterwards to Sumatra aiming to link up with the evacuating British forces. After trekking across 200 miles of jungle for five weeks, during which Judy survived an attack from a crocodile, the crew arrived a day after the final vessel had left and subsequently became prisoners of war of the Japanese. She was eventually smuggled into the Medan camp, where she met Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams for the first time, who she would go on <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> her life with. Williams convinced the camp Commandant to register her as an official prisoner of war, with the number '81A Gloergoer Medan'. She was the only dog to be registered as a prisoner of war during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, {{but other than}} that fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and Jeremias Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars {{in the middle of the}} century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E
