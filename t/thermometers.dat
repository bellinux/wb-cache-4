5|$|RNA <b>thermometers</b> and riboswitches {{are thought}} to be {{evolutionarily}} ancient due to their wide-scale distribution in distantly-related organisms.

40|$|Abstract: A hybrid-type surface <b>thermometer</b> {{combines}} the contact and non-contact methods, which {{allows us to}} overcome the shortcomings of both methods. The hybrid-type surface <b>thermometer</b> is a modified radiation <b>thermometer.</b> Temperature measurement using this <b>thermometer</b> is possible within a random error of ± 0. 5 K at temperatures of around 1000 K. This <b>thermometer</b> provides a useful means for calibration of in-situ temperature measurement in various processes, especially in the semiconductor industry. This paper introduces the basic idea of the hybrid-type surface <b>thermometer,</b> presents experimental results and discussions, and finally describes an application...|$|R

50|$|The sea {{temperature}} {{at the water}} sampling depth is recorded {{by means of a}} reversing <b>thermometer</b> fixed to the Nansen bottle. This is a mercury <b>thermometer</b> with a constriction in its capillary tube which, when the <b>thermometer</b> is inverted, causes the thread to break and trap the mercury, fixing the temperature reading. Since water pressure at depth will compress the <b>thermometer</b> walls and affect the indicated temperature, the <b>thermometer</b> is protected by a rigid enclosure. A non-protected <b>thermometer</b> is paired with the protected one, and comparison of the two temperature readings allows both temperature and pressure at the sampling point to be determined.|$|R
5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal <b>thermometers,</b> since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool <b>thermometers</b> as well as on <b>thermometers</b> for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.|$|E
