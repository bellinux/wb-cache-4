The center for US testing of the herbicides used in Ranch Hand was Eglin AFB, primarily on Range C-52A. For ten years, 1961 to 1971, 222,530 liters of herbicides (Agents Purple, Orange, White and Blue) were sprayed at a <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> on the base reservation. These herbicides were estimated to contain at least 3.1kg of dioxin. Soil sampling at the test site conducted in 1970–1987 confirmed that there was TCDD contamination, though only about 1 percent remained. [...] "Researchers theorized that much of the dioxin was broken down in the hot Florida sun or relocated due to wind or water erosion. At the storage and loading site west of the airstrip, residual dioxin was also found. [...] Mitigation efforts were conducted, including the construction of a concrete drainage ditch and the building of a sediment pond to keep the dioxin from migrating into the nearby ravine and water bodies that lead to the city of Fort Walton Beach water supply. In 2001, the area around Hardstand 7 was capped with concrete and remediation activities concluded." ...|$|E

40|$|Glaucoma is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease that affects the retinal ganglion cells leading to a progressive loss of visual function that develops in characteristic scotoma patterns. The ability to distinguish normal and glaucomatous patients purely from patterns of visual field threshold data using supervised machine learning classifiers is explored in Chapter 2. While these classifiers can separate the data, they do not make explicit the underlying differences in the spatial patterns of thresholds between the two groups. These spatial patterns are explored in Chapter 3 using statistical resampling techniques. The patterns of luminance threshold changes are related to existing abnormalities found at baseline and follow the structure- function relationship of the underlying retinal nerve fiber bundle projections. The results suggest that increasing {{the density of the}} visual function exam's <b>testing</b> <b>grid</b> may allow for earlier detection of local changes and for better spatial characterization of glaucomatous progression. A technique for assessing progression in visual field exams with condensed <b>test</b> <b>grids,</b> Scotoma Oriented Perimetry (SCOPE), is proposed in Chapter 4. The method regresses neighboring groups of locations and has the potential for increasing the number of detected progression events and decreasing the time to detection relative to traditional, point-wise progression techniques that assess threshold changes in each location separately. Finally, in Chapter 5, the proposed grouped- location progression method is applied to visual field series data from participants who have undergone testing with traditional, pattern 24 - 2 <b>grids</b> and condensed <b>test</b> <b>grids.</b> Grouped-location progression analysis of condensed <b>test</b> <b>grids</b> identifies more progression events than in pattern 24 - 2 <b>test</b> <b>grids.</b> In addition, these changes are detected earlier than traditional, point-wise progression analysis of pattern 24 - 2 grids...|$|R

Interruptions that has occurred on 10 kV voltage level and on overhead lines or underground cable was examined. The examined interruptions {{are based on the}} DARWin data from Mälarenergi Elnät. The examined interruptions resulted in four different test grids. <b>Test</b> <b>grid</b> A are overhead line grid in rural area, <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> B are mixed grid in rural area, <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> C are underground cable grid in semi urban area and <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> D are underground cable grid in urban area. <b>Test</b> <b>grid</b> C and D which have the highest customer density were then used for reliability analysis.

Another focus for the reliability analysis was introducing breakers at key-points in <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> C. The primarily cause of interruptions on overhead line grids are weather related events and on underground cable grids it is digging and fabrication or material errors.

40|$|PURPOSE: To cluster {{test points}} in {{glaucoma}} patients' 30 - 2 and 10 - 2 visual field (VF) (Humphrey Field Analyzer: HFA, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) {{in order to}} map the different regions damaged by the disease. METHOD: This retrospective study included 128 eyes from 128 patients. 142 total deviation (TD) values (74 from the 30 - 2 VF and 68 from the 10 - 2 VF) were clustered using the 'Hierarchical Ordered Partitioning And Collapsing Hybrid-Partitioning Around Medoids' algorithm. The stability of the identified clusters was evaluated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: 65 sectors were identified in total: 38 sectors were located outside the 10 - 2 VF whereas 29 sectors were located inside the 10 - 2 VF (two sectors overlap in both grids). The mapping of many sectors appeared to follow the distribution of retinal nerve fiber bundles. The results of bootstrapping suggested clusters were stable whether they were outside or inside the 10 - 2 VF. CONCLUSION: A considerable number of sectors were identified in the 10 - 2 VF area, {{despite the fact that}} clustering was carried out on all points in both the 30 - 2 VF and 10 - 2 VF simultaneously. These findings suggest that glaucomatous central VF deterioration cannot be picked up by the 30 - 2 <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> alone, because of poor spatial sampling; denser estimation of the central ten degrees, than offered by the 30 - 2 <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> alone, is needed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In each of the 10 rabbits, 4 titanium cylinders were placed on the external cortical plates of their calvaria. Four treatment modalities were randomly allocated: (i) empty, (ii) HA/SiO, (iii) DBBM, and (iv) DBBM plus rhBMP- 2 (DBBM/BMP). The animals were sacrificed at week 8. Descriptive histology and histomorphometric assessment using a superimposed <b>test</b> <b>grid</b> of points and cycloids were performed.
