5|$|As {{the second}} English {{football}} club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, {{with which it}} further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Persian carpet {{is a part}} of Persian (Iranian) art and culture. Carpet-weaving in Persia {{dates back}} to the Bronze Age. The {{earliest}} surviving corpus of Persian carpets come from the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736) in the 16th century. However, painted depictions prove a longer history of production. There is much variety among classical Persian carpets of the 16th and 17th century. Common motifs include scrolling vine networks, arabesques, palmettes, cloud bands, medallions, and overlapping geometric compartments rather than animals and humans. This is because Islam, the dominant religion in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> forbids their depiction. Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes. The majority of these carpets are wool, but several silk examples produced in Kashan survive.|$|E

25|$|A major advance {{occurred}} in 1969, when David Attenborough commissioned the snooker tournament Pot Black {{to demonstrate the}} potential of colour television, with the green table and multi-coloured balls being ideal for showing off the advantages of colour broadcasting. The TV series became a ratings success and was for a time the second most popular show on BBC Two. Interest in the game increased and the 1978 World Snooker Championship {{was the first to}} be fully televised. The game quickly became a mainstream game in the UK, Ireland and much of the Commonwealth and has enjoyed much success since the late 1970s, with most of the ranking tournaments being televised. In 1985 a total of 18.5 million viewers watched the concluding frame of the world championship final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis. The loss of tobacco sponsorship during the 2000s led to a {{decrease in the number of}} professional tournaments, although some new sponsors were sourced; and the popularity of the game in the Far East and China, with emerging talents such as Liang Wenbo and more established players such as Ding Junhui and Marco Fu, boosted the sport in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
500|$|In January 1941 the British Army began {{planning}} for operations in Greece. Fairley and his British colleague, Colonel J. S. K.

Drawing {{on the experience}} of the Salonika front in the First World War, where very heavy casualties suffered from malaria, plus Fairley's more recent experience in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> they painted a gloomy picture, emphasising the grave risks, and {{going so far as to}} suggest that the Germans might attempt to entice the allies into a summer campaign in which they could be destroyed by malaria. The British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell decried their report as [...] "typical of a very non-medical and non-military spirit", but a face-to-face meeting with Boyd and Fairley convinced Wavell that they were serious and not merely uncooperative, and Wavell promised his assistance in mitigating the danger. The campaign plan was altered to position allied forces further south, away from the plains of Macedonia and the Vardar and Struma River basins, where malaria was hyper-endemic and heavy casualties had been suffered from malaria by British troops during the First World War.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} legends in Greece {{surrounding}} the Fall of Constantinople.

Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick fog, a condition unknown in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about {{the dome of the}} Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the Holy Spirit departing from the city. [...] "This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears." [...] For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of John Hunyadi who had come to relieve the city.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1943, Churchill visited Turkey {{and at the}} Adana {{summit with}} Inönü {{appeared}} to have won a promise that the Turks would enter the war {{on the side of}} the Allied state later that year. Papen frustrated this British diplomatic gambit partly by getting Hitler to send a letter to Inönü assuring him that Germany had no interest in invading Turkey and partly by threatening to have the Luftwaffe bomb Istanbul if Turks joined the Allies, telling Inönü that most of the buildings in Turkey's largest city were wooden and would burn well if the Luftwaffe were to bomb that city. In July 1943, the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) recruited a wealthy Czech Jewish businessman living in Istanbul named Alfred Schwartz, whose codename was [...] "Dogwood" [...] and who became the chief OSS agent in Turkey. Schwartz formed the so-called [...] "Dogwood" [...] spy network, which was based in Turkey and stretched all over the Balkans and into Central Europe, and which was the OSS's principal source of information in <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> On his own initiative, Schwartz [...] sought to determine whether American support for anti-Nazi conservatives could be arranged in order to stop the war before the Red Army arrived in Central Europe; and at times Schwartz's agenda contradicted the American policy of unconditional surrender, as he had surmised that the United States was willing to make a negotiated peace with Germany. The OSS via Schwartz tried to infiltrate the German embassy by recruiting a volksdeutsch (ethnic German) journalist from Slovakia living in Turkey named Fritz Fiala, formerly an ardent Nazi who decided to switch sides after the Battle of Stalingrad and who started to work for the OSS in 1943. Fiala was in regular contact with Papen, but Bauer described him as probably a double agent who was merely trying to play off both sides to his own advantage as all of the information he provided to the Americans was [...] "old" [...] and [...] "inaccurate". The Dogwood group was in contact with Paul Leverkühn, the chief Abwehr station chief in Turkey, who also happened to be a friend of Papen, and although Papen did not negotiate with the Dogwood group, instead dealing with the American OSS agents directly, nevertheless Papen had gotten the idea that the United States wanted a negotiated peace, based on what Leverkühn had told him from his dealings with the Dogwood group.|$|E

2500|$|The {{policies}} of Weltpolitik, especially the Tirpitz Plan {{brought about a}} period of Anglo-German tension {{in the first years}} of the 20th century. Chamberlain who detested the land of his birth had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain who came to hate Britain expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own. In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom.. in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined...We find ourselves in such a time today." [...] Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and the good of the rest of the world. In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of [...] "stupid" [...] Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood, without the German blood in the House of Romanov [...] "nothing would remain but a decaying matière brute" [...] in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a [...] "Dollar dynasty", writing: From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, not a moment longer. <b>That</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> it may be proven, creates sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past. Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: [...] "The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth". To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing, völkisch Pan-German League.|$|E
