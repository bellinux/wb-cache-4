5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's <b>temperature</b> <b>resistance.</b> Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

The evaporated films, which were typically ∼ 20 Å thick, were deposited between layers of SiOx on a sapphire substrate. Suitable films had room <b>temperature</b> <b>resistances</b> per square in the range 10 - 13 KΩ and these values increased to 105 - 106 Ω at 1 °K. By using very short (25 µ) conduction paths in parallel, device resistances were reduced to ∼ 100 Ω at 1 °K. We have tested devices down to 0. 1 °K and two serious problems limit their usefulness : the low <b>temperature</b> <b>resistances</b> are quite non-ohmic for small currents; the thermal time constants are surprisingly long...|$|R

25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest <b>temperature</b> <b>resistance,</b> which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E
25|$|One design {{weakness}} of the two-fluid design is the necessity for a barrier wall between the core and the blanket region, a wall {{that would have to}} be replaced periodically because of fast neutron damage. Graphite was the material chosen by ORNL because of its low neutron absorption, compatibility with the molten salts, high <b>temperature</b> <b>resistance,</b> and sufficient strength and integrity to separate the fuel and blanket salts. The effect of neutron radiation on graphite is to slowly shrink and then swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and a deterioration in physical properties. Graphite pipes would change length, and may crack and leak. ORNL chose not to pursue the two-fluid design, and no examples of the two-fluid reactor were ever constructed.|$|E

2500|$|Although this {{technique}} is rather simple, it represents an enormous fabrication problem. A new kind of cell pattern potentially introduces as much as twice the amount of fabrication cost and infrastructure; the number of possible quantum dot locations on an [...] grid is doubled and an overall increase in geometric design complexity is inevitable. Yet another problem {{this technique}} presents is that the additional space between cells of the same orientation decreases the energy barriers between a cell's ground state and a cell’s first excited state.

2500|$|Aluminium {{was widely}} used in the speaker {{industry}} due to its low cost, ease of bonding, and structural strength. When higher power amplifiers emerged, especially in professional sound, the limitations of aluminium were exposed. It rather efficiently but inconveniently transfers heat from the voice coil into the adhesive bonds of the loudspeaker, thermally degrading or even burning them. [...] Motion of the aluminium bobbin in the magnetic gap creates eddy currents within the material, which further increase the temperature, hindering long-term survival. In 1955 DuPont developed Kapton, a polyimide plastic film which did not suffer from aluminium's deficiencies, so Kapton, and later Kaneka Apical were widely adopted for voice coils. As successful as these dark brown plastic films were for most hi-fi voice coils, they also had some less attractive properties, principally their cost, and an unfortunate tendency to soften when hot. Hisco P450, developed in 1992 to address the softening issue in professional speakers, is a thermoset composite of thin glassfibre cloth, impregnated with polyimide resin, combining the best characteristics of polyimide with the <b>temperature</b> <b>resistance</b> and stiffness of glassfibre. It withstands brutal physical stresses and operating temperatures up to 300°C, while its stiffness helps maintain the speaker's 'cold' frequency response.|$|E
