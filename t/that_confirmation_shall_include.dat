50|$|With {{the liberation}} of Montenegro from the Central Powers' {{occupation}} by the Serbian armed forces after the break through the Balkan Front, Popović attempted to secure the return of Nicholas and the Government to Montenegro on 16 November 1918 at the British Court, but this attempt has met only refusal. Although also failing to secure France's support for Nicholas' return, {{he has managed to}} get <b>confirmation</b> <b>that</b> France <b>shall</b> respect the legal Montenegrin authorities in exile and secure that the local military administration shall administer {{in the name of the}} King. France also claimed it will remain neutral for Montenegro's internal affairs, respecting the King's authority but also not opposing the desire and free will of the Montenegrin people to decide. Popović's government and King Nicholas have accepted these terms, which henceforth became the basis for the Podgorica Assembly.|$|R
