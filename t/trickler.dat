25|$|A {{precision}} scale is a near necessity for reloading. While {{it is possible}} to load using nothing but a powder measure and a weight to volume conversion chart, this greatly limits the precision with which a load can be adjusted, increasing the danger for accidentally overloading cartridges with powder for loads near or at the maximum safe load. With a powder scale, an adjustable powder measure can be calibrated more precisely for the powder in question, and spot checks can be made during loading {{to make sure that the}} measure is not drifting. With a powder <b>trickler,</b> a charge can be measured directly into the scale, giving the most accurate measure.|$|E
500|$|To further his investigations, Tintin {{decides to}} visit Akass' villa. Arriving at Ischia, Tintin and Haddock receive death threats warning them to leave. When Castafiore hears {{that they are}} on the island, she welcomes them to Akass' villa, informing them that Akass himself is in Rome. At the villa, they meet a number of acquaintances, the corrupt {{industrialists}} W.R. Gibbons (from The Blue Lotus) and R.W. <b>Trickler</b> (from The Broken Ear), Emir Ben Kalish Ezab (from Land of Black Gold), Luigi Randazzo (a singer), and Ramó Nash. Tintin and Haddock stay the night at the villa on Castafiore's insistence. During the night, Tintin witnesses men loading canvases into a van, and exploring the villa discovers a room full of faked paintings by prominent artists. He is discovered by Akass, who informs him that he uses Nash's [...] "Alph-Art" [...] as a front for his criminal forgery business. Akass declares his intention to kill Tintin by having him covered in liquid polyester and sold as a work of art by César Baldaccini.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantity}} of gunpowder is specified by weight, but almost always measured by volume, especially in larger scale operations. A powder scale {{is needed to}} determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, as loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5mg). One grain is 1/7000 of a pound. Competition shooters will generally throw a slightly underweight charge, and use a powder <b>trickler</b> to add few s of powder at a time to the charge to bring it to the exact weight desired for maximum consistency. Special care is needed when charging large capacity cases with fast burning, low volume powders. In this instance, it is possible to put two charges of powder in a case without overflowing the case, which can lead to dangerously high pressures and a significant chance of bursting the chamber of the firearm. Non-magnum revolver cartridges are the easiest to do this with, as they generally have relatively large cases, and tend to perform well with small charges of fast powders. [...] Some powders meter (measure by volume) better than others due to the shape of each granule. [...] When using volume to meter each charge, it is important to regularly check the charge weight on a scale throughout the process.|$|E

In a world of Rastapopouloses, <b>Tricklers</b> and Carreidases—or, more prosaically, Jolyon Waggs and Bolt-the-builders—Tintin represents an unattainable ideal of goodness, cleanness, authenticity."

50|$|Solids {{accumulate}} on {{the surface}} of the organic filter media (or filter packing). The liquid fraction drains through the medium into the sump or equaliser and is either discharged from the reactor or recirculated to the top entry for further treatment. Wastewater is discharged to the surface of the filter packing by direct application or by sprinklers, drippers or <b>tricklers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Influent {{entry is}} from above the filter media. Full-flush toilets {{can have the}} entry point {{into the side of}} the reactor, whereas micro-flush toilets, because these do not provide {{sufficient}} water to convey solids through sewer pipes, are generally installed directly above the reactor. For primary treatment reactors, sufficient vertical space must be provided for growth of the pile. This is dependent on volume of solids in the influent and decomposition rate. Secondary and tertiary treatment reactors can use sprinklers or <b>tricklers</b> to distribute the influent wastewater evenly over the filter media to improve treatment efficiency of the filter media.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{also came}} into play in The Broken Ear. Western {{businesses}} General American Oil and British-South American Petrol get the states of San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico {{to go to war}} over territory which turns out not to have oil after all. This part of the story was inspired by the real-life Chaco War of 1932-35. One of the businessmen, R.W. <b>Trickler,</b> uses bribery, corruption, and false evidence in order to get his way. Arms dealer Basil Bazarov, who sells weapons to both sides, is based on the real-life Basil Zaharoff.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Laboratory stream {{communities}} in simulated old growth second order streams were sampled June 1984 and June 1985 to advance {{an understanding of}} their organization and development, and their response to an environmental perturbance, the toxicant dieldrin. An interpenetrating hierarchical view of habitats and community subsystems was taken to conceptualize community organization. Major habitats defined major community subsystems and microhabitats defined sdbcommunity subsystems. Community development was influenced by colonization from a species pool and habitat development. Four colonizing strategies were observed including High Potential, Pulse, <b>Tricklers</b> and Intermittent colonizers. Seventy-four percent of the community biomass for all stream samples was composed of High Potential taxa. Riffle habitats contained the highest biomass and taxa diversity, and the Rapid habitat contained the lowest biomass and taxa diversity. Trophic organization changed with time, was different in the toxicant treated stream and was unique to each microhabitat. Fine-particle detritivores were the most ubiquitous trophic group. Microphyte herbivores greatly decreased in 1985 from 1984 levels. Community differences in the toxicant treated stream included lower biomass, fewer microphyte herbivores, lower taxa diversity, {{a greater number of}} fine-particle detritivores and a smaller range of habitat utilization. Percentage similarity of subconimunities at both the major and microhabitat organizational levels found the 1985 control stream to contain the most distinct subcommunities. Habitat associations and trophic feeding habits provided the basis for a life history classification of the community taxa consisting of Habitat Generalists, Backwater and Slow Current organisms and Rheophiles...|$|R

5000|$|The Broken Ear: Tortilla is {{completely}} {{missing from the}} plot, and is replaced by Walker's aide, Lopez (who is not described as a half-caste). Further, Colonel/Corporal Diaz and the entire subplot involving the rivaling petroleum companies are removed, and accordingly, Tintin never falls out of favor with General Alcazar, and Alonzo and Ramon never find Tintin in the Amazon. Instead, they disappear from the story line after Tintin escapes from them in San Theodoros, and do not appear again until the climax. Also, Tintin's disguise to spy on Ramon and Alonzo is changed from the blackface makeup he uses in the book to a false mustache and glasses in the episode. While in the book, Tintin walks alone back to Sanfacion, Nuevo Rico after being caught by Alonzo and Ramon, in the episode he is escorted (off screen) by Ridgewell and the Arumbayas to San Theodoros. At {{the end of the}} episode, Tintin saves Ramon and Alonzo, whereas in the book they drown and disappear into Hell, though it is speculated that this may be an imaginary scene or hallucination. Pablo and <b>Trickler</b> do not appear. (The former creates a continuity error with the cartoon adaptation of [...] "Tintin and the Picaros" [...] where the young reporter remembers him.) ...|$|E
30|$|The use of AgNPs {{has become}} more {{widespread}} for sensing, catalysis, transport, and other applications in biological and medical sciences. This increased use has led to more direct and indirect exposure in humans [2, 6]. AgNPs could induce multiple unpredictable and deleterious effects on {{human health and the}} environment due to their increasing use. AgNPs can cause adverse effects in directly exposed primary organs and in secondary organs such as the cardiovascular system or central nervous system (CNS) upon systemic distribution. Nanoparticles can reach the CNS via different routes [7, 8]. Elder et al. [9] demonstrated that manganese oxide nanoparticles could reach the brain through the upper respiratory tract via the olfactory bulb in rats. It has been shown that small nanoparticles can translocate through and accumulate in an in vitro blood brain barrier model composed of rat brain microvessel vascular endothelial cells [10]. <b>Trickler</b> et al. [11] demonstrated that small nanoparticles could induce inflammation and affect the integrity of a blood-brain barrier model composed of primary rat brain microvessel endothelial cells.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Demand {{for water}} from the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) {{continues}} to increase, despite a Cap on diversions being in place since 1996. Previous and ongoing efforts to improve water use efficiency within the Basin have focused primarly on engineering solutions, in particular through reducing losses from seepage, leakage and evaporation within the distribution system, including by upgrading channels or replacing them with pipes. Water trading is enabling water to be moved from low value to high value enterprises consistent with market demand. On many properties the instillation of improved water reticulation and application systems, including replacing some of the flood and furrow systems with sprinkler, <b>trickler</b> and micro-drip systems, is also achieving significant savings. A model was constructed to explore the potential for achieving further on-farm savings within the MDB through increased adoption of best management practices aided by low {{and high levels of}} investment. Despite significant limitations in the underlying data, it was shown that savings in excess of 900 GL per annum can be achieved on irrigated farms in the Basin, under reasonable time frames, and plausible scenarios for farm investment and the adoption of new technologies. Savings of this magnitude have the potential to provide a significant incentive to develop and implement policies that could bring them into being...|$|E
