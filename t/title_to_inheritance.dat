40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on <b>titles</b> <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The aim of the thesis is to capture their course in the Czech Republic. This thesis is {{systematically}} divided into seven chapters. The first one is the introduction, in which the author justifies chosen topic. The second chapter {{is focused on}} development of inheritance law. Following chapters are focused on <b>titles</b> <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Each chapter is divided into several parts. These parts are lined up chronologically. <b>Titles</b> <b>to</b> <b>inheritance</b> are lined up in order to their legal force in recent legislation. At first the author is focused on inheritance contract in the third charter. Before ObčZ 2012, inheritance contract was in legal force at least more than 60 years ago and it returns by ObčZ 2012 to our legal system. The fourth chapter is focused on testament. At its first part there is a brief view into ABGB. In the following part narrowing of legislation {{under the influence of}} so called Legal Biennial is visible. The chapter ends with a view into the ObčZ 2012, which is strikingly similar to provisions of ABGB. The fifth chapter deals with intestacy. It is visible that the provisions in ObčZ 2012 are similar ABGB. In the sixth chapter there is conclusion in which the author presents her opinions on the whole topic. The seventh chapter includes [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Generally, all {{legitimate}} {{males of}} a German baronial family inherit the title Freiherr or Baron from birth, as all legitimate daughters inherit {{the title of}} Freiin or Baroness. As a result, German barons have been more numerous than those of such countries where primogeniture with respect <b>to</b> <b>title</b> <b>inheritance</b> prevails (or prevailed) as France and the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|When Doukas {{took the}} annual tribute to Sultan Mehmed II in Adrianople that August, the Sultan learned that Dorino {{had died and}} Domenico was now lord of Lesbos; this angered the Sultan, and Doukas was {{informed}} {{that no one had}} the right <b>to</b> assume the <b>title</b> of lord of Lesbos until he had received it from the hands of the Sultan himself. Nervous negotiations followed, and Domenico only obtained <b>title</b> <b>to</b> his <b>inheritance</b> after surrendering the isle of Thasos and paying an increased tribute of 4000 gold pieces, instead of the 3000 previously given. But that was not the only loss to Domenico's realm, for on the excuse of lèse-majesté the Turkish admiral Yunus Pasha sailed to Phocaea and seized it outright for the Sultan on 31 October 1455.|$|R

That wealth we might, it is true, obtain by artifice or by arms; but how much better that it should come into the family in a regular fashion, thereby ousting the claim of the Crown. Things {{in this country are}} disturbed at present, but they will not always be disturbed, for in the end somebody must give way and order will prevail. Then questions might be asked, for persons in possession of great riches are always the mark of envy. But if the heiress is married to a good Catholic and loyal subject of the king, who can cavil at rights sanctified by the laws of God and man? Think it over, my dear Adrian, think it over. Step-mother or wife--you can take your choice." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Hindu bill itself {{received}} much criticism {{and the main}} provisions opposed were those concerning monogamy, divorce, abolition of coparcenaries (women inheriting a shared <b>title)</b> and <b>inheritance</b> <b>to</b> daughters. The first President of the country, Rajendra Prasad, opposed these reforms; others included the Congress party president Vallabhbhai Patel, a few senior members and the Hindu fundamentalist parties. The fundamentalists called it [...] "anti-Hindu" [...] and [...] "anti-Indian"; as a delaying tactic, they demanded a uniform civil code. The women members of the parliament, who previously supported this, in a significant political move reversed their position and backed the Hindu law reform; they feared allying with the fundamentalists would cause a further setback to their rights.|$|R

Moreover, Emlyn is right; even foolish women should {{not trust the}} first Jack with whom they take a lodging. Still, since you swear that you do in your kindness, I'll try to show myself not all unworthy, my Lady Harflete. Now, {{what is it you}} want from the King? Justice on the Abbot? That you'll get for nothing, if his Grace can give it, for this same Abbot stirs up {{rebellion}} against him. No need, therefore, to set out his past misdeeds. A clean <b>title</b> <b>to</b> your large <b>inheritance,</b> which the Abbot claims? That will be more difficult, since the King claims through him. At best, money must be paid for it. A declaration that your marriage is good and your boy born in lawful wedlock? Not so hard, but will cost something. The annulment of the sentence of witchcraft on you both? Easy, for the Abbot passed it. Is there aught more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Fifth. The {{necessity}} of the advocateship of Jesus Christ is also manifest in this, for {{that there is}} need of one to plead the efficacy of old <b>titles</b> <b>to</b> our eternal <b>inheritance,</b> when our interest thereunto seems questionable by reason of new transgressions. That God's people may, by their new and repeated sins, as to reason at least, endanger their interest in the eternal inheritance, is manifest by such groanings of theirs as these-"Why dost thou cast me off?" [...] (Psa 43:2). [...] "Cast me not away from thy presence" [...] (Psa 51:11). And, [...] "O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever?" [...] (Psa 74:1). Yet I find {{in the book of}} Leviticus, that though any of the children of Israel should have sold, mortgaged, or made away with their inheritance, they did not thereby utterly make void their <b>title</b> <b>to</b> an interest therein, but it should again return to them, and they again enjoy the possession of it, in the year of jubilee. In the year of jubilee, saith God, you shall return every man to his possession; [...] "the land shall not be sold for ever," [...] nor be quite cut off, [...] "for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the land of your possession, ye shall grant a redemption for the land" [...] (Lev 25:23,24).|$|R
40|$|The right <b>to</b> <b>inheritance</b> {{represents}} one of the basic human rights. As such this right is regulated by the law. The Law on Inheritance in Kosovo regulates substantially, all the issues related <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> In this context, this Law contains numerous rules that proclaim full equality of women with men <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Regardless of equality proclaimed by law practical reality of life indicates a different situation. This reality proves that women participation <b>to</b> <b>inheritance</b> nevertheless is very small. The reasons for this situation are numerous and diverse, but mostly {{they have to deal with}} the still existence in people's conscience of many customary rules, which constantly treated women as a subject of second hand. In this article a modest attempt is made to reflect besides legal aspect also the practical situation indicating the degree of women participation <b>to</b> <b>inheritance</b> in Kosovo, in all grades that she may appear as heir...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{delegation}} may in some cases be preferred <b>to</b> <b>inheritance</b> <b>to</b> make program code more readable and understandable. Despite explicit delegation being fairly widespread, relatively few major programming languages implement delegation as an alternative model <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The precise relationship between delegation and inheritance is complicated; some authors consider them equivalent, or one a special case of the other.|$|R

In this research, it argues that the judge adopts a verdict according to the Law Number 1 / 1974 and Compilation of Islamic Law. The article uses legal research which accords to the norms in the positive law including the judge decision. It concludes that apostate can affects the marriage and the children right <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Additionally, divorce may not be renewed except both conducts a new marriage. In pertaining to the children right to heritance, children could not inherit their apostate parent(s) because Islamic law determines that apostate can be the reason of losing the right <b>to</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Keywords: Divorce, Apostate, Adjudication, Children Right <b>to</b> <b>Inheritance...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the United States, most jurisdictions {{have enacted}} a slayer statute, which codifies the rule and {{supplies}} additional conditions. Such laws have sometimes been construed narrowly because the relevant statutes are criminal in nature, and serve {{to take away}} someone's rights that are otherwise afforded by law. Interpreted this way, a slayer statute will not prevent the killer from acquiring <b>title</b> <b>to</b> the property by other means. In jurisdictions with a common law slayer rule, a slayer statute may serve to extend and supplement the common law rule, rather than limiting it. For example, where the statute requires the heir to have been convicted <b>to</b> bar <b>inheritance,</b> a common law slayer rule {{that does not have}} this requirement may still serve <b>to</b> bar <b>inheritance.</b>|$|R
50|$|Consanguinity is also {{relevant}} <b>to</b> <b>inheritance,</b> {{particularly with}} regard to intestate succession. In general, the law favors inheritance by persons closely related to the deceased.|$|R

However, since August 2013 it became possible to hold AIM-listed shares in a stocks and shares ISA, {{some of which}} qualify for business relief; in this way a stocks and shares ISA portfolio consisting of these securities can be gifted without being subject <b>to</b> <b>Inheritance</b> Tax, provided the qualifying securities are held {{for at least two}} years upon death.|$|R

50|$|Polygenic <b>inheritance</b> refers <b>to</b> <b>inheritance</b> of a {{phenotypic}} characteristic (trait) that {{is attributable to}} two or more genes and can be measured quantitatively. Multifactorial <b>inheritance</b> refers <b>to</b> polygenic <b>inheritance</b> that also includes interactions with the environment. Unlike monogenic traits, polygenic traits do not follow patterns of Mendelian inheritance (discrete categories). Instead, their phenotypes typically vary along a continuous gradient depicted by a bell curve.|$|R
