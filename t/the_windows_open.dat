25|$|Wife and I are come {{to settle}} here. We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open,</b> hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E
25|$|In the US, China, UK, Ireland and Canada, a {{dormitory}} {{may be a}} room containing more than one bed. Examples are found in British boarding schools and many rooming houses such as hostels but have nowadays completely vanished {{as a type of}} accommodation in university halls of residence. CADs, or cold-air dormitories, are found in multi-level rooming houses such as fraternities, sororities, and cooperative houses. In CADs and in hostels, the room typically has very few furnishings except for beds. Such rooms can contain anywhere from three to 50 beds (though such very large dormitories are rare except perhaps as military barracks). Such rooms provide little or no privacy for the residents, and very limited storage for personal items in or near the beds. Cold-air dorms get their names from the common practice of keeping <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> year-round, even in winter. The practice emerged based on the theory that circulation and cold air minimizes the spread of disease. Some communal bedrooms keep the name cold-air dorms or cold dorms despite having modern heating or cooling.|$|E
500|$|The [...] building, {{originally}} {{named the}} Logan Riding Ring, {{was completed in}} 1929. Mrs.Thomas F. Logan, an Ardsley resident {{and member of the}} Sleepy Hollow Riding Committee, funded the building's $300,000 expense ($ in [...] ) and supervised its construction. The building has a length of 180 feet and a width of 95 feet. Its exterior is stucco over concrete block; the building has a main section with a round-arched asbestos-shingled roof, and is two stories high, five bays wide (...) , and ten bays deep (...) [...] The building has narrow metal-framed tripartite casement windows with brick sills. The upper, eight-light sections of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> horizontally, and the lower portions with sixteen lights open vertically; the central twenty-light sections are fixed. The structure's bays are divided on the side facades by sloping concrete ground-to-cornice buttresses, paired at the intersections of the side and rear facades. Around 1931, an exhibition ring and corrals were constructed near the riding ring.|$|E

60|$|The count went to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>opened</b> it, {{and called}} his friends below to come up.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>opened</b> into a garden, and Jacob, listening, {{could hear}} {{footsteps}} as of men {{running in the}} streets.|$|R
500|$|Rick Danko {{recalled}} that he, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined Robbie Robertson in West Saugerties, {{a few miles}} from Woodstock, in February 1967. The three of them moved into a house on Stoll Road nicknamed [...] "Big Pink"; Robertson lived nearby with his future wife, Dominique. Danko and Manuel had been invited to Woodstock to collaborate with Dylan on a film he was editing, Eat the Document, a rarely seen account of Dylan's 1966 world tour. At some point between March and June 1967, Dylan and the four Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions, initially at the so-called Red Room of Dylan's house, Hi Lo Ha, in the Byrdcliffe area of Woodstock. In June, the recording sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink. Hudson set up a recording unit, using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Grossman, as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Dylan would later tell Jann Wenner, [...] "That's really the way to do a recording—in a peaceful, relaxed setting—in somebody's basement. With <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> ... and a dog lying on the floor." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Second to {{the right}} and then {{straight}} on till morning" [...] is said multiple times throughout Elizabeth Wein's novel Code Name Verity. The novel also references the lost boys, and some of the characters, whose names are to be secret, are referred to as characters from the novel, for example, [...] "This young fellow-let's call him Michael (after the youngest of the Darling children in Peter Pan!"… (p.154). One character keeps <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> at night, [...] "just in case" [...] as her children are off fighting in the war.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{which were}} flown from 1972–1982, {{were assigned to}} the Air Force Reserve after their service in Vietnam, and used for normal cargo and aeromedical evacuation missions. Air crews accumulated hundreds of flight hours aboard several contaminated aircraft that were often flown with <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> due to the smell and eye irritation. Memos surfaced showing that Air Force JAG officers recommended keeping the toxicity information, [...] "...within official channels." [...] Further, Major Carter located Air Force reports of dioxin-contaminated aircraft sold abroad, and of one used at the Robins AFB, Georgia Museum of Aviation with public access to the contaminated surfaces of the aircraft. In 2010, due to concerns about dioxin contamination, the Air Force took the unusual step of shredding all the remaining surplus C-123K/UC-123K aircraft and melting the scraps into ingots for disposal.|$|E
60|$|A light now flashed into existence, <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>opened,</b> and <b>the</b> farmer stood {{revealed}} {{as one in}} a terrific passion.|$|R
60|$|Standing on Arthur's {{shoulders}} Jack {{took out}} his knife, and had no difficulty in inserting the blade between the frames of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> which <b>opened</b> inwards, and in pushing back the slight and simple fastening. He pushed <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>open,</b> and had {{his foot on the}} sill ready to enter when he paused.|$|R
60|$|Stephen glanced {{quickly at}} the door, and, pursing up his lips, frowned. He threw <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>open,</b> and inhaled <b>the</b> night air.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never told}} us you'd started smoking," [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Parsons, almost with disapprobation, [...] "Would you like <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> {{to let the}} smell out, Richmond?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just so,' said Clement; 'and I think I {{am doing}} more good at home. Imagine my finding all <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> in that pouring rain, and Cherry sitting shivering.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Forel flung one of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open.</b> [...] "I fancy my wife {{is waiting}} for us, gentlemen, and I {{will be with you}} in a few minutes," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|While David is home, Grockle {{suddenly}} awakens to find <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>opened.</b> Curious as he was, {{he flies}} out of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Nobody could prevent it, even David.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{said the}} clerk, staring about him wildly in the darkness. [...] "I've only just got back. I told you I {{had a long}} day's work this morning--I locked the door and shut <b>the</b> <b>window</b> down--it's <b>open</b> now, <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> <b>open.</b> Look! {{somebody}} has got in there and taken the keys." ...|$|R
60|$|A huge hand jerked <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>open</b> {{and caught}} Carl by the hair. Two wild faces {{stared at each}} other, six inches apart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll come in {{and bring}} my things at nine o'clock to-night," [...] said Mr. Hatchard. [...] "I'd like <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> and the rooms aired a bit. And what about the sheets?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! but to-day he's here {{to attend}} a directors' meeting {{and the opening of}} the Free Library and Tasajara Hall. I saw <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open,</b> and the blinds up in his house across the plaza as I passed just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will leave}} the door open, Anna; {{it is better to}} let the air {{circulate}} as much as possible. When the weather gets warmer you will also leave <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> while you are at work; but the air is too damp at present." ...|$|E
60|$|Blanche {{left the}} sofa, and, going to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> {{shutters}} {{to look out}} at the night. She suddenly came back to Anne.|$|R
6000|$|JANET [She {{rushes to}} ANNYS, embraces her.] You've won, you've won! [She flies to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>opens</b> it, and goes out {{on to the}} balcony.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Candles?" [...] he cried. And {{with that}} he ran to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>opened</b> it, and looked abroad. [...] "It might be spied from the road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, but it {{was such}} a shock, and such a thing to see the house all empty and forlorn, with <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open,</b> and {{everything}} so still! Miss Belmarche cried too, and said she did not wonder my feelings overcame me, and she did not see papa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the morning}} passed {{with a strange}} far-awayness and quietness. Dinner-time came, when she and Maggie ate joyously, with all <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open.</b> And then they went out into St. Philip's churchyard, where was a shadowy corner under red {{hawthorn}} trees. And there they talked and read Shelley or Browning or some work about [...] "Woman and Labour".|$|E
6000|$|Every day {{seemed more}} dreary to Alora than the last. She soon became very restless under her {{enforced}} confinement and her nerves, {{as well as}} her general health, began to give way. She had been accustomed to out-of-door exercise, and these rooms were close and [...] "stuffy" [...] because Janet would not allow <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} with <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>open,</b> {{listening}} for you. I came outside {{to see what had}} happened, and I saw your lights standing still." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>opened,</b> {{it could}} be pushed aside without noise. Did you notice whether the candlesticks were {{standing}} where you had left them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Lord's will be done. It's {{hard times}} for such as us," [...] said the man; and leaving <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>open,</b> he retired into his room.|$|R
60|$|They {{began to}} ring the bell on that Sunday morning before ten o'clock. Mrs. Fenwick was still sitting at the breakfast-table, with <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open,</b> when the sound was first heard,--first heard, that is, on that morning. She looked at Mary, groaned, and put {{her hands to her}} ears. The Vicar laughed, and walked about the room.|$|E
60|$|When I saw {{him going}} downstairs {{early in the}} morning (for, thank Heaven! he would not stay to breakfast), it {{appeared}} to me as if the night was going away in his person. When I went out to the Commons, I charged Mrs. Crupp with particular directions to leave <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open,</b> that my sitting-room might be aired, and purged of his presence.|$|E
60|$|Through <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>open</b> to {{the garden}} came from the {{distance}} the faint throbbing of a drum to remind them {{of what was happening}} around them. But the sound went unheeded. To each it must have seemed that here they were {{face to face with a}} horror greater than any that might be tormenting Paris. At last Andre-Louis began to speak, his voice level and unutterably cold.|$|E
25|$|In mid-November, before <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>opened,</b> former youth goalkeeper David Knight {{returned}} to the club on a month-to-month contract as cover following an injury to third-choice keeper Jason Steele.|$|R
6000|$|But the {{insinuation}} {{was lost}} on Mrs Rampy, who was naturally keen of scent. She rose, ran to <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>opened</b> it, thrust out her dishevelled head, and exclaimed [...] "Fire!" ...|$|R
60|$|Soames {{rose and}} went to <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> He stood there in sardonic fury. Congenital idiot--spidery {{congenital}} idiot! Seven months at fifteen pounds a week--to be tracked down as his own wife's lover! Guilty look! He threw <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>open.</b>|$|R
