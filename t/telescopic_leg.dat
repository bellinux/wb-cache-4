40|$|We {{clarified}} {{that the}} common necessary condition for generating a dynamic gait results from the requirement to restore mechanical energy through studies on passive dynamic walking mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel method of generating a dynamic gait {{that can be found}} in the mechanism of a swing inspired by the principle of parametric excitation using <b>telescopic</b> <b>leg</b> actuation. We first introduce a simple underactuated biped model with telescopic legs and semicircular feet and propose a law to control the <b>telescopic</b> <b>leg</b> motion. We found that a high-speed dynamic bipedal gait can easily be generated by only pumping the swing leg mass. We then conducted parametric studies by adjusting the control and physical parameters and determined how well the basic gait performed by introducing some performance indexes. Improvements in energy efficiency by using an elastic-element effect were also numerically investigated. Further, we theoretically proved that semicircular feet have a mechanism that decreases the energy dissipated by heel-strike collisions. We provide insights throughout this paper into how zero-moment-point-free robots can generate a novel biped gait...|$|E
40|$|A topological {{approach}} {{to the theory of}} equilibrium phase transitions in statistical physics is based on the Topological Hypothesis (TH), which claims that phase transitions are due to changes of the topology of suitable submanifolds in the configuration space. In this paper we examine in detail the anti-ferromagnetic mean-field XY model and study topology of the sub-energy manifolds. The latter can be interpreted mechanically as configuration space of a linkage with one <b>telescopic</b> <b>leg.</b> We use methods of Morse theory to describe explicitly the Betti numbers of this configuration space. We apply these results to the anti-ferromagnetic mean-field XY model and compute the exponential growth rate of the total Betti number. The previous authors instead of the total Betti number studied the Euler characteristic. We show that in the presence of an external magnetic field the model undergoes a single "total Betti number phase transition".

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{creation of}} methods for research of multi-section manipulators of parallel structure. To solve this task it is necessary, firstly, {{to carry out}} generalization, systematization, and enhancement of existing models of platform manipulators with six degrees of freedom; secondly, {{it is necessary to}} modify previously suggested methods for solving the kinematic tasks for the specified type of manipulation mechanisms. The paper presents detailed domain analysis, describes major issues appearing in the course of research, and suggests basic methods of their solution. The paper demonstrates the necessity for modification of existing models through supplementing new parameters. Modification and generalization of the previously suggested method for solution of direct kinematic problem for the specified type of manipulators were carried out. Method for solution of this problem consists in establishing the dependence of functional relationship of Cartesian coordinates and orientation of the moving platform center on the values of generalized coordinates of manipulator (in case of platform manipulators, these are the lengths of <b>telescopic</b> <b>legs</b> connecting the base and the moving platform of the manipulator). The method is created {{in such a way that}} solution of direct kinematic problem results in finding of the analytical equation of the plane where the moving platform lies. The equation of the required plane is described through three points (attachment points of the moving platform joints). To define coordinate values of the joints, the system of nine non-linear equations is generated. It should be noted that the system of equations is composed of one-type equations with the same type of nonlinearity. The physical meaning of all the nine equations of the system is Euclidean distance between the points of the manipulator. The location and orientation of the manipulator are depicted as a homogenous transformation matrix. Vectors of translation and rotation for this matrix can be defined through required plane. The theory was verified with the outcome of the experiment. It is planned to create new methods and approaches, which allow us to spread the methods for solution of kinematic problems on the type of multi-section manipulators. </p...|$|R

The Suntour Swing Shock fork is based on a coil cantilevered swing set-up, and suspension is given by a coil spring which is located within the steerer tube and can be accessed from the top, technology which was originally used for suspension on early motorcycles.|$|R
