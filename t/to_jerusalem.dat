5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Among Jehovah's Witnesses the Star of Bethlehem {{is seen as}} {{a product}} of Satan, rather than a sign from God, since the star led the astrologers <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> where they met King Herod's plan to kill Jesus.|$|E
50|$|With Jordanian {{defenses}} in Jerusalem crumbling, {{elements of}} the Jordanian 60th Brigade and an infantry battalion were sent from Jericho <b>to</b> reinforce <b>Jerusalem.</b> Its original orders were to repel the Israelis from the Latrun corridor, but due to the worsening situation in Jerusalem, the brigade was ordered <b>to</b> proceed <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem's</b> Arab suburbs and attack Mount Scopus. Parallel to the brigade were infantrymen from the Imam Ali Brigade, who were approaching Issawiya. The brigades were spotted by Israeli aircraft and decimated by rocket and cannon fire. Other Jordanian attempts <b>to</b> reinforce <b>Jerusalem</b> were beaten back, either by armoured ambushes or airstrikes.|$|R

5|$|Some western {{scholars}} {{hold that}} the Isra and Mi'raj journey traveled through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the celestial al-Baytu l-Maʿmur (heavenly {{prototype of the}} Kaaba); later traditions indicate Muhammad's journey as having been from Mecca <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cheering crowds {{greeting}} Jesus as {{he enters}} Jerusalem add to the animosity {{between him and the}} establishment.

50|$|Here we see Jesus lamenting that He {{is unable}} <b>to</b> save <b>Jerusalem</b> {{as they are}} not willing. We see that whilst Jesus wants <b>to</b> save <b>Jerusalem</b> He respects their choice to {{continue}} on in Sin despite His will that they be saved.|$|R
5|$|The emperor's {{siege of}} Shaizar was unsuccessful, but Shaizar was heavily damaged. After the siege, Usama left Zengi's service {{and went to}} Damascus, which was ruled by Mu'in ad-Din Unur, the atabeg of the Burid dynasty. Zengi was {{determined}} to conquer Damascus, so Usama and Unur turned to the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem for help. Usama was sent on a preliminary visit <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> in 1138, and in 1139 Zengi captured Baalbek in Damascene territory. In 1140 Unur sent Usama back <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> to conclude a treaty with the crusaders, and both he and Unur visited their new allies numerous times between 1140 and 1143. Afterwards, Usama was suspected {{of being involved in}} a plot against Unur, and he fled Damascus for Fatimid Cairo in November, 1144.|$|E
5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E

He opposed the Russian government's attempt to confiscate the properties of the Armenian Church in 1903, which was later canceled partly due to his efforts. Khrimian further endorsed the liberation movement of the Armenian revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|Despite the uncertainly {{surrounding}} {{the inception of}} his reign, the chronicle reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced continued opposition from within his own family {{in the form of}} an ongoing rebellion by his brother, Haraldr. Lǫgmaðr eventually overcame Haraldr, however, and is stated to have had the latter blinded and emasculated. Afterwards, if the chronicle is to be believed, Lǫgmaðr repented the cruelty that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom, before setting off <b>to</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> where he died.|$|E
