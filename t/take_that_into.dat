500|$|Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was {{originally}} set {{to play the}} part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film. As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, {{as part of the}} character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which [...] "reflects {{things that are going on}} currently in this privileged world that we are living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world. I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>into</b> consideration". Howard focused on Kate [...] "being accustomed to fear and loss" [...] because the character was a military brat.|$|E
500|$|Developing the {{gameplay}} {{began at}} the start of development, with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system. Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years. While creating the battle system, the staff decided that the key words should be [...] "order" [...] and [...] "chaos": whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor. One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering, Zael's ability to direct all enemies' attention towards him. At first, Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield, and this resulted in the trial-and-error period for it running on for a long time. The biggest challenge, once the concept had been finalized, was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types. A concept that did not make it into the final game was [...] "Replay": after an enemy successfully cast a spell, players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>into</b> their strategy. This slowed the pace of combat down too much, so the concept was entirely removed. Hangovers of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions, and the overhead perspective when commanding party members The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote's control scheme.|$|E

60|$|The girl {{seemed a}} little mollified at that, and said that for herself, she knew the worst of it, she could seek her fortune; {{but it was hard}} her brother and sister should suffer on her score; and said {{something}} that was tender and well enough on that account. But Amy told her it was for her to <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>into</b> consideration; for she would let her see that it was all her own; that she would have done them all good, but that having been used thus, she would do no more for any of them; and that she should not need to be afraid to come into her company again, for she would never give her occasion for it any more. This, by the way, was false in the girl too; for she did venture into Amy's company again after that, once too much, as I shall relate by itself.|$|E

6000|$|The organist, a sprightly young man, came in {{and began}} turning over his music, and the choir took their-places, in the old-fashioned' manner. Then came the clergyman. His beard was white, his face long and narrow and shrivelled, his {{forehead}} protruding, his eyes of the cold blue of a winter's sky. The service began, and Honora repeated the familiar prayers which she had learned by heart in childhood--until her attention was arrested by the words she spoke: [...] "We have offended against Thy holy laws." [...] Had she? Would not God bless her marriage? It was not until then that she began to pray with an intensity that blotted out the world that He would not punish her if she had done wrong in His sight. Surely, if she lived henceforth in fear of Him, He would let her keep this priceless love which had come to her! And it was impossible that He should regard it as an inordinate and sinful affection--since it had filled her life with light. As the wife of Hugh Chiltern she sought a blessing. Would God withhold it? He would not, she was sure, if they lived a sober and a righteous life. He would <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>into</b> account, for He was just.|$|E
