5|$|Raymond's father {{encouraged}} {{his love}} of drawing from an early age, leading him to become an assistant illustrator in the early 1930s on strips such as Tillie the <b>Toiler</b> and Tim Tyler's Luck. Towards the end of 1933, Raymond created the epic Flash Gordon science-fiction comic strip {{to compete with the}} popular Buck Rogers comic strip and, before long, Flash was the more popular strip of the two. Raymond also worked on the jungle adventure saga Jungle Jim and spy adventure Secret Agent X-9 concurrently with Flash, though his increasing workload caused him to leave Secret Agent X-9 to another artist by 1935. He left the strips in 1944 to join the Marines, saw combat in the Pacific Ocean theater in 1945 and was demobilized in 1946. Upon his return from serving during World War II, Raymond created and illustrated the much-heralded Rip Kirby, a private detective comic strip. In 1956, Raymond was killed in a car crash at the age of 46; he was survived by his wife and five children.|$|E
25|$|Hearst loved {{seeing her}} in {{expensive}} costume pictures, {{but she also}} appeared in contemporary comedies like Tillie the <b>Toiler,</b> The Fair Co-Ed (both 1927), and especially three directed by King Vidor, Not So Dumb (1930), The Patsy and the backstage-in-Hollywood saga Show People (both 1928). The Patsy contains her imitations which she usually did for friends, of silent stars Lillian Gish, Mae Murray and Pola Negri. King Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst wanted her to be. He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.|$|E
500|$|The eponymous {{character}} Winnie Winkle was a young, unmarried {{woman who}} had to support her parents, making it the second popular comic strip about working women (after Somebody's Stenog, which debuted in 1918). It was {{a reflection of the}} new role of women in society, as could also be seen in comics such as Tillie the <b>Toiler</b> from 1921. Writing for the Associated Press in 1993, Hugh A. Mulligan noted, [...] "After women got the vote and joined the work force, family-centered comics were joined by working-girl strips like Winnie Winkle, Tillie the <b>Toiler,</b> Dixie Dugan, Somebody's Stenog and Brenda Starr, which was drawn by a woman, Dale Messick. Almost from the beginning, politics and a social conscience hovered over the drawing board." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Toilers</b> is a 1928 American drama film {{starring}} Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Jobyna Ralston {{and directed}} by Reginald Barker. Fairbanks plays one of the <b>toilers</b> (coal miners), while Ralston plays his sweetheart. It is a silent film with synchronized music and special effects.|$|R
60|$|Every day the {{criss-cross}} of ties lengthened {{out along}} the winding road-bed, and the lines of glistening rails kept pace with them. The sun beat down hot--the dust flew in sheets and puffs--the smoky veils floated up from the desert. Red-shirted <b>toilers,</b> blue-shirted <b>toilers,</b> half-naked <b>toilers,</b> sweat and bled, and laughed grimly, and sucked at their pipes, and bent their broad backs. The pace had quickened to the limit of human endurance. Fury of sound filled the air. Its rhythmical pace was the mighty gathering impetus of a last heave, a last swing.|$|R

2500|$|Farmer {{had both}} {{critical}} champions and detractors. Leslie Fiedler proclaimed him [...] "the greatest science fiction writer ever" [...] and lauded {{his approach to}} storytelling as a “gargantuan lust to swallow down the whole cosmos, past, present and to come, and to spew it out again.” Isaac Asimov praised Farmer as an [...] "excellent science fiction writer; in fact, a far more skillful writer than I am...."

[...] The Points of Departure criticized the classical Ba'athist view regarding private ownership.

The document called for nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy, the slow incorporation of the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist economy and the elimination of the national bourgeoisie and its allied classes. To safeguard the party from evolving into one supporting state capitalism, the socialist economy would be controlled by a vanguard party together with popular participation from the <b>toiler</b> masses.|$|E

The development process started in 1946 and the first prototypes known under the name [...] "Truzhenik" [...] (<b>Toiler)</b> were built in 1947. After extensive on-road testing, the new off-road vehicle went into production on August 25, 1953. Over 600,000 GAZ-69s had been built by the end of production in the USSR in 1972. A similar vehicle based upon the GAZ-69's design was produced by ARO in Romania until 1975, first as the IMS-57, then as the IMS M59, and later modernized as the ARO M461. GAZ-69s were standard military jeeps of the Eastern Bloc and client states.|$|E
2500|$|In {{designing}} the strip, Gray {{was influenced by}} his midwestern farm boyhood, Victorian poetry and novels such as Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, Sidney Smith's wildly popular comic strip The Gumps, and the histrionics of the silent films and melodramas of the period. Initially, there was no continuity between the dailies and the Sunday strips, but by the early 1930s the two had become one. The strip (whose title was borrowed from James Whitcomb Riley's 1885 poem [...] "Little Orphant Annie") was [...] "conservative and topical", according to the editors of The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia, and [...] "represents the personal vision" [...] of Gray and Riley's [...] "homespun philosophy of hard work, respect for elders, and a cheerful outlook on life". A Fortune popularity poll in 1937 indicated Little Orphan Annie ranked number one and ahead of Popeye, Dick Tracy, Bringing Up Father, The Gumps, Blondie, Moon Mullins, Joe Palooka, Li'l Abner and Tillie the <b>Toiler.</b>|$|E
