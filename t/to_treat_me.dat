In his opening speech Gairdner stated that [...] "The public must {{learn that the}} {{handicapped}} person is not an invalid.

2500|$|The {{production}} of opening track [...] "Still Standing", {{one of the}} first songs written for the album, was tracked by the reality television show format Monica: The Single on Peachtree TV in 2008. A well-received anthem about empowerment, starting with [...] "an icy club-busting backbeat and a gothic, low-octave choir," [...] it features guest vocals by Monica's cousin Ludacris and was initially considered to be released as the album's first single, but J Records rejected to promote the song as Still Standing′s lead.

Second track, Los Da Mystro-crafted [...] "One In a Lifetime", was among a number of songs that leaked a year prior to the album's official release. Announced as the album's leading single at a time, the [...] "lush, piano-laced" [...] song deals with finding true love. Ne-Yo-prenned third track [...] "Stay or Go", one out of several tracks the songwriter and Monica worked on over a course of a week, deals with a [...] "if you’re not going <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> right, then here’s the option"–nature, according to Monica. [...] "He wanted to do a record that spoke to who I am," [...] she said, [...] "and he reached back into my history on how I’ve delivered records in a sassy yet vocal way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, {{look you}} here, Anne," [...] said George, {{in a sort}} of hiss, and {{standing}} over her in a threatening attitude, [...] "I have suspected for some time that you were playing me false in this business, and now I am sure of it. You have put the girl up <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> like this, you treacherous snake; you have struck me from behind, you Red Indian in petticoats. But, look here, I will be square with you; you shall not have all the laugh on your side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the next}} day," [...] he declared, in an aggrieved tone, [...] "I {{heard that you}} were engaged <b>to</b> Caroom. You <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> shamefully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will come--with pleasure," [...] she said, [...] "if {{you will}} promise <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> {{as a new}} acquaintance--not to refer to--Paris--at all." ...|$|E
60|$|ROSE. I suppose so, else he wouldn't {{treat me}} as he's done. He's after that--that--He didn't ought <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> as if I was dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's got {{no right}} <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> like that. My money's {{as good as}} anyone else's. I pay him to teach me. That's not {{teaching}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound {{the little}} termagant!" [...] broke out Harry. [...] "What does she mean by being so pert <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> She <b>treats</b> <b>me</b> as if I was a fool!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my dear Count," [...] she said, [...] "I {{am going}} to talk to you as a woman of the world. You know that my husband, in leaving his fortune entirely <b>to</b> Jeanne, <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> very badly. You may know this, or you may not know it, {{but the fact remains that}} I am a very poor woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think you're clever, to pin {{me to the}} ground in this manner. But when my friends, the other Kalidahs, come here, they'll tear you <b>to</b> pieces for <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to know}} now. You have {{no right}} <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> in this fashion. I'll have you and Doctor Montgomery put in jail for it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not at all. This {{is simply}} a chapter of coincidences. Now what I {{want you to feel}} is this.

How can he help you?" ...|$|R

60|$|TANNER. [rising {{from his}} chair on the other ride of Hector] Never fear: there's no {{question}} of his becoming a navvy, Mrs Malone. [To Hector] There's really no difficulty about capital <b>to</b> start with. <b>Treat</b> <b>me</b> as a friend: draw on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "The signoras {{are good}} enough <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> as a brother," [...] he said, [...] "and I will not affirm {{that they have}} not {{obtained}} some slight information." ...|$|E
60|$|RICHARD. I {{think you}} might have the decency <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> as a {{prisoner}} of war, and shoot me like a man instead of hanging me like a dog.|$|E

50|$|Throughout 2003 their debut, For Sleepyheads Only {{was still}} being echoed across the globe in {{staggered}} releases with special editions released to Russia and Greece. Beatservice Records then went on <b>to</b> release <b>Treat</b> <b>Me</b> Like You Do - For Sleepyheads Only Remixed in June. While their debut continued to make its way around, the band wasted no time and began work on their second album {{for the majority of}} the year, which was recorded in Paris in October.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't think papa {{has a right}} <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> in this way," [...] she said. [...] "He wouldn't {{be allowed}} to kill me, and this is killing me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{recommend}} you {{to control your}} temper, and <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> with common courtesy," [...] he said, in his quietest, firmest tones, looking at Fabio steadily while he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was {{this right}} in thee, brother?" [...] he cried, laying {{his hand on}} Heika's shoulder, on {{recovering}} himself; [...] "was it wise <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> thus like a child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you did it, anyway. And I have a {{right to}} feel hurt, and I do feel hurt, <b>to</b> have you <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> so. It seems to me that when a person goads, and crowds, and in a manner forces another person to talk, it is neither very fair nor very good-mannered to call what he says clack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We don't have meat every day, Mr. Goldmore,' he continued, 'and it's a <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to get {{a dinner}} like this. You little know, you gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease, what hardships {{briefless}} barristers endure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|At length I {{put in a}} word. [...] "Sir," [...] says I to the Dutch merchant, [...] "what is {{all this}} {{discourse}} to my business? What is this gentleman in all these passions about?

6000|$|CATHERINE. Indeed? All {{the more}} reason for you <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> with respect, Captain. [To the others.] Begone. How many times must I give an order before it is obeyed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what right}} has he <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> so? Did you ever before hear {{of such a}} thing? Why is he {{to be allowed to}} go back,--without punishment,--more than another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{does not}} care a straw for what I advise, not one straw. Why should he? How can I tell him to be sober when I have been a beast all my life myself? How can I advise him? That's where it is! It is that that now kills me. Advise! Why, when I speak <b>to</b> him he <b>treats</b> <b>me</b> like a child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I beg you won't mention it, sir,' {{replied the}} {{feminine}} Pott, with vivacity. 'It {{is a high}} <b>treat</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I assure you, to see any new faces; living as I do, from day to day, and week to week, in this dull place, and seeing nobody.' ...|$|R
