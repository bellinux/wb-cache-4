5|$|Once the Trust took ownership, {{scaffolding}} {{was placed}} in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> repair the roof lantern. While this was in place the architectural paint analyst Lisa Oestreicher was able to examine the decorative scheme {{that had been used}} in the spaces and room frequented by the public. Three principal phases were identified: 1860s original; 1870s updates and adaptions; 1887–90 redecoration, which returned the main spaces to the original green colours and motifs created by Crace. Once lantern repairs were complete, the Trust replaced the elderly chenille carpet destroyed by contractors working for Christie's with a new Wilton carpet with a replica design by Linney Cooper, bought with £45,000 from public lottery donations.|$|E
5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Ariana Richards said, [...] "I {{was called}} into a casting office, {{and they just}} wanted me to scream. I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that day, and I {{was the only one}} who ended up waking his {{sleeping}} wife off the couch, and she came running through <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> see if the kids were all right." [...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Duplessis and Labelle, it is {{a normal}} side {{platform}} station built partially in tunnel, with access through a deep open cut leading to the single entrance. Murals by Guy Montpetit are exhibited in the entrance building and <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stairwell.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Longpré, Marchand, Goudreau, Dobush, Stewart, et Bourke, it is {{a normal}} side {{platform}} station built in tunnel. The central mezzanine gives access to the entrances diagonally across from one another {{at the corner of}} rue de Cadillac and rue Sherbrooke. <b>The</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> these entrances feature complementary murals by Jean Cartier.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{features}} of the campus are no longer present. <b>The</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> Central's auditorium once were home to many ivy plants. The plants were removed in the 1970s for fear of possible damage to the building, but ivy murals were painted {{on the walls of}} a <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> replace them. <b>The</b> <b>hallway</b> became known as the [...] "Hall of Ivy". The Hall of Ivy has become a memorial at the school for students who have died.The school originally had a bell tower {{on the front of the}} building, however it was removed in 1916 for the strain it placed on the façade.|$|R
500|$|While Henert {{established}} perimeters around Cole Hall, Mitchell and Grady {{entered the}} building, where {{they met with}} Holland, Ellington, and Wright. [...] Ellington, the first officer to arrive on the scene, evacuated the adjacent auditorium, and met with the other officers in the front walkway. [...] Holland was instructed to remain in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> ensure no one came into the auditorium and that the shooter did not come out. Grady, Mitchell, Ellington, and Wright entered the south auditorium, discovering a body on the stage, surrounded by guns, with {{a pool of blood}} coming from the head. Victims with varying injuries lay on the floor or were propped up against the seats. Confirming there were no immediate threats, Grady and Mitchell began attending to victims, while Ellington and Wright confirmed that the shooter was dead. [...] At 3:11:42 (five minutes after the first 911 call), Ellington reported to the dispatcher, [...] "Shooter's down. Shotgun's secure. [...] We need an ambulance and the coroner at Cole Hall." ...|$|E
500|$|... "G.U.Y." [...] {{begins as}} Gaga rises {{again in a}} white dress, reborn as a Greek goddess of sorts and the song begins to play. Shots of Gaga in {{different}} outfits, including a blue dress and white bikini are shown with dance sequences. Andy Cohen and the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills make cameos in the video. A scene featuring Gaga rolling around on a seashell bed in a red outfit, dancing in a gold leotard with arrows, and floating on a bed in a pool are shown throughout the song. With the help of YouTuber SkyDoesMinecraft (also making his cameo appearance), Michael Jackson, Mahatma Gandhi, John Lennon, and Jesus are resurrected using the game Minecraft and their blood is used to create clones known as [...] "G.U.Y." [...] Gaga, Vanderpump, and Richards are seen {{coming out of a}} car in black outfits, shooting money cannons, and walking down <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> kill corporate executives to replace with G.U.Y. clones. The video ends with thousands of these clones marching out of the castle. The credits section of the video then features [...] "Manicure" [...] playing.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Madonna and her dancers go from <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> a bar where the singer forcefully makes Kortajarena drink a beverage, dry humps a dancer and {{continues}} dancing. The guest appearances start with Cyrus pointing her middle finger towards the camera wearing glitter around her eyes, followed by Wang, Diplo and Rocco in the bar, Beyoncé posing like Madonna's music video for [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990), Perry moving {{around to the}} song, and David dancing while Madonna and the others cheer him; all of them mouth the song name while they appear onscreen. As the chorus ends, a dancer brings a video screen behind them where Minaj appears rapping her part, interspersed by shots of West cheering. Madonna and her dancers continue moving through the room with falling confetti and reach a dance pole. She climbs {{through a set of}} dimly lit stairs and reaches the rooftop where the party is taking place. The song nears to an end and Madonna is shown surrounded by her dancers and some partygoers while she lies down; interspersed scenes show her twerking and dancing alone in a room wearing a cap with Hebrew word [...] "" [...] ("Shalom") written on it. The video ends with a far away shot of the Standard Hotel's brightly lit rooftop where the party continues.|$|E
5000|$|Clarkson was {{designed}} like many 1970s-era schools in Ontario {{as part of}} an experimental “open-concept” design. On the ground floor, the cafeteria and auditorium are central to the design; a tech/drama wing, staff room, and gymnasiums are placed on the west side, while a classroom wing adorns the east side. These were open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> <b>to</b> other classrooms, separated only by pillars.|$|R
50|$|Central, {{which is}} a major {{interchange}} point between the Metro, local and longer-distance bus lines, and the SuperVia train network, is the busiest station on the network. The Cardeal Arcoverde station was dynamited out of the base of São João Mountain and retains a cavelike structure. General Osório has some painting in <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> remember prehistoric attempts at communication.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the school}} {{organized}} {{a series of}} murals and artwork displays within <b>the</b> building's <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> showcase student accomplishments and school spirit.|$|R
2500|$|Much of the cloister area is {{occupied}} by the [...] "Museo Virrenal" [...] (Colonial Era) founded in 1925 in what were the portico, the kitchen the refectory and <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> the refectory. It has three main halls which give a detailed explanation {{of the construction of}} the site, the lives of the monks and the collection of paintings and religious objects that are on display. The museum contains more than 120 pieces. Many of the religious artwork and objects are in the third hall and include furniture, cloaks, and other religious garb (some embroidered in gold thread), sculptures in stone, wood and corn stalk paste, and oils from the 16th to the 19th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|On May 10, 2015 an {{open letter}} from the school's Human Rights League was {{published}} on the website of the school's newspaper, The Smoke Signal. The letter referenced [...] "incidents of racism" [...] at the school, including a swastika being drawn on a hallway wall and white supremacy hand signs being flashed at sporting events. Media in northern New Jersey and nearby New York City {{picked up on the}} report, and the Anti-Defamation League visited with the school superintendent on Thursday, May 21. School officials revealed in media reports that five students were suspended, although the school would not make it clear what, if any, involvement these students had had in the incidents. To protest against white supremacy and to promote racial equality, school students put up a banner in <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> <b>to</b> be signed by students who wanted racial tolerance and diversity.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Hynden Walch. In the episode [...] "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", {{she is the}} only {{cheerleader}} at X-Men academy. After she becomes a victim of Ringmaster, she still shows her peppy side in her cheers (Call me Phoenix, call me Jean. Red-haired, mutant, prom night queen. I'll rap you with a mental hurl, if you call me Marvel Girl! Go Mutants!), after she's done her cheer she uses the Phoenix Force and creates a heavy windstorm in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> open the lockers and find a fractal while under Ringmaster's control. Oddly while the comic book cover intro for the episode shows Jean wearing a childlike version of her classic Phoenix costume, she wears a cheerleader uniform with a X-logo in the actual episode. She also makes an appearance in the episode [...] "Ice Man Cometh" [...] where she is telekinetically keeping the water from the melted ice caps from hitting the school.|$|E
30|$|Disadvantage: {{after death}} occurs, the patient’s body must be wheeled rapidly through <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{operating}} room, creating {{an atmosphere of}} urgency that is not conducive to the serenity desirable under these circumstances. Extubation in the ICU may per se contribute {{to the failure of}} organ retrieval, thereby jeopardizing the reciprocal commitments made by the healthcare team to the family and by the family to the last wishes of the patient.|$|R
50|$|The mosque has {{a wooden}} chair that was {{dedicated}} to {{the reading of the}} Prophet's Hadith and is still in <b>the</b> qibla <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> this day since the date of its creation in the year 927.|$|R
50|$|Finally, hallway transom {{windows in}} each {{classroom}} (put {{in place for}} ventilation when the campus had no air conditioning) will be removed. This will allow <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> ceilings <b>to</b> be lowered and lighting to be improved and upgraded.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly after 1:30 pm on June 13, 2008, Russert {{collapsed}} at {{the offices}} of WRC-TV, which houses the Washington, D.C. bureau of NBC News where he was chief. He was recording voiceovers for the Sunday edition of Meet the Press. In a speech he gave at the Kennedy Center, Brian Williams said that Russert's last words were, [...] "What's happening?" [...] spoken as a greeting to NBC Washington bureau editing supervisor Candace Harrington as he passed her in the hallway. He then walked down <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> record voiceovers in the soundproof booth and collapsed. A co-worker began CPR on him. The District of Columbia Fire and Rescue service {{received a call from}} NBC at 1:40 pm, and dispatched an EMS unit which arrived at 1:44 pm. Paramedics attempted to defibrillate Russert's heart three times, but he did not respond. Russert was then transported to Sibley Memorial Hospital, arriving at 2:23 pm, where he was pronounced dead. He was 58 years old.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{foundation}} {{was made}} of steel-reinforced concrete with pilings sunk [...] to [...] The [...] "new" [...] Number 10 consisted of about 60% new materials; the remaining 40% was either restored or replicas of originals. Many rooms and sections of the new building were reconstructed exactly {{as they were in}} the old Number 10. These included: the garden floor, the door and entrance foyer, the stairway, <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> the Cabinet Room, the Cabinet Room, the garden and terrace, the Small and Large State Rooms and the three reception rooms. The staircase, however, was rebuilt and simplified. Steel was hidden inside the columns in the Pillared Drawing Room to support the floor above. The upper floors were modernised and the 3rd floor extended over Numbers 11 and 12 to allow more living space. As many as 40 coats of paint were stripped from the elaborate cornices in the main rooms revealing details unseen for almost 200 years in some cases.|$|E
60|$|He ran for <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> <b>to</b> find it {{so thick}} with smoke that escape in that {{direction}} seemed cut off.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Putnam Hall {{was in an}} uproar, and boys were pouring into <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> {{demanding}} <b>to</b> know {{if there was a}} fire or a robbery. Soon Captain Putnam appeared, wrapped in a dressing robe and wearing slippers.|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} unlocked, for those inside had not {{dreamed of being}} disturbed. On tiptoes the party entered <b>the</b> dark <b>hallway.</b> <b>To</b> keep out <b>the</b> cold, {{the door to the}} sitting room had been closed. From within the room came a murmur of voices.|$|R
2500|$|On May 21, 2013, Aunor celebrated her 60th {{birthday}} dubbed as [...] "Nora at 60" [...] at the Meralco Multi-Purpose Hall. The venue {{was transformed}} into a virtual museum as posters of her classic films adorned the lobby and <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ballroom.|$|R
60|$|She nodded smilingly {{and left}} the room, while the maid Twinkle led Dot {{up the stairs and}} along <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> her room.|$|E
60|$|Both youths made a {{thorough}} search, which lasted {{so long that}} Phil and Roger came into <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> ascertain what was keeping them.|$|E
6000|$|... "The noise {{you heard}} was from our room, yes. But that isn't what I was getting at," [...] stammered Sam. [...] "We set a guard out in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> keep watch." ...|$|E
60|$|The servant {{left him}} {{standing}} in <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> and started <b>to</b> ascend the great staircase, but halfway up he met Miss Harding coming down.|$|R
60|$|Clad {{in their}} pajamas, the boys flocked out into <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> there <b>to</b> {{be joined by}} others. Word was passed around of what had occurred, and all {{made their way to}} the door of the instructor's apartment. They heard him yelling for help with all his might.|$|R
60|$|Somebody was at <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> door, trying <b>to</b> {{insert a}} {{key in the}} lock. But the key would not go in, because of the key already there.|$|R
60|$|He {{slipped into}} {{part of his}} clothing, and, taking the water pitcher, made his way through <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> the nearest of the bathrooms. Here he {{obtained}} the coldest drink possible, and then, filling the pitcher, started to return to dormitory No. 12.|$|E
60|$|At {{the head}} of the {{stairway}} he paused and looked curiously about him. And then he went along <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> its other end; and, coming back, ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations. Every door that he found in the house was painted green.|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} Mr. Mellaire. He had slipped down the booby hatch {{into the big}} after-room and thence through <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> my room. He entered noiselessly, on clumsy tiptoes, and pressed his finger warningly to his lips. Not until he was beside my bunk did he speak, {{and then it was}} in a whisper.|$|E
60|$|Master Plummer {{turned to}} walk out of <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> in {{obedience}} <b>to</b> this command, when Dan, clutching him by the arm, brought the boy to a sudden standstill.|$|R
60|$|Along <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> {{they rushed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closed {{door at the}} end--the door of the room in which the three listened breathlessly--hurling {{themselves}} against it in violent effort to gain admission.|$|R
50|$|Buppah {{returns to}} her apartment, where she will likely stay for eternity. Ake's ghost, now legless, sits outside in <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and apologizes <b>to</b> Buppah {{for the rest of}} his ghost eternity.|$|R
