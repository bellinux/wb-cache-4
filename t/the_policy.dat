The ACWF was responsible for publicizing <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> and its content, but questioned if <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Prime Minister, Key led the Fifth National Government of New Zealand which entered {{government}} {{at the beginning of}} the late-2000s recession in 2008.

In February 2011, a major earthquake in Christchurch, the nation's second largest city, significantly affected the national economy and the government formed the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in response. In its second term, Key's government announced a policy of partial privatisation of five state-owned enterprises; while <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> was enacted, voters in a citizens-initiated referendum on the issue were 2 to 1 opposed to <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b> In foreign policy, Key announced the withdrawal of New Zealand Defence Force personnel from their deployment in the war in Afghanistan, signed the Wellington Declaration with the United States and pushed for more nations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed on <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

30|$|Considering {{the results}} {{presented}} in Figure 10, <b>the</b> RE+ <b>policy</b> was <b>the</b> one that presented the best trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

However, if we observe the correspondent graphs of efficiency (Figure 10 b), the PAM-SLIM algorithm execution with <b>the</b> RE+ <b>policy</b> was <b>the</b> one that presented the smallest number of distance computations, in general. For example, considering the results obtained when k was 15, <b>the</b> RE+ <b>policy</b> showed 90.1 % less distance computations than <b>the</b> PDS <b>policy,</b> 89.3 % less distance computations than <b>the</b> MST <b>policy,</b> 88.7 % less distance computations than <b>the</b> RE <b>policy,</b> 85.7 % less distance computations than <b>the</b> MinMax <b>policy,</b> 83.6 % less distance computations than <b>the</b> MD <b>policy,</b> and 65.7 % less distance computations than <b>the</b> Random <b>policy.</b>|$|R
