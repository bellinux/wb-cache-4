5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it,</b> they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E
5|$|Much of Redemption's {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted issues with the initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it</b> was a particular downside. Next Generation, who provided {{the game with a}} score of 3 out of 5, said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. PC Gamers review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.|$|E

At the 1838 coronation, the organist had attempted to play the instrument and conduct at the same time, {{with the result that}} neither function was satisfactory. Bridge not only delegated the organ to Walter Alcock, but also used two sub-conductors, and furthermore alternated with Parratt in conducting {{from the top of the}} organ screen. The only real musical error was that Bridge misjudged the timing of I Was Glad and had finished the anthem before the King had arrived, having <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it</b> when the right moment came. Bridge was saved by the organist, who improvised in the interim.|$|E
25|$|In the chaos, Wayne and Stella {{escape to}} a dock, but are cornered {{by a group}} of Shadows. Stella pleads with Wayne to kill her, causing him to recall a {{repressed}} memory; upon returning to his home after the outbreak, he found he had only two bullets in his gun. With the house under siege from Shadows, Shannon pleaded with him to kill her and Lydia. With great reluctance, Wayne did so. Having remembered the incident, he refuses <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it</b> by killing Stella, instead telling her she must survive and never give up hope. He breaks the wood of the dock, allowing Stella to make it to a nearby sailboat and drift away. Wayne apologizes to his deceased daughter, who appears in front of him, as he laments he should have died with her. However, he is happy they will be together again soon. As the Shadows race towards him, Wayne accepts his fate.|$|E

[...] The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the Kingsale hat. According to the fable, John de Courcy, Earl of Ulster, obtained from King John the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue—de Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege—several authorities on the peerage have seen fit <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it.</b> A 19th-century edition of Burke's Peerage suggests the origins of the privilege: ...|$|E

An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it,</b> and steal the gift. The tengu, however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, because they are disgusted by his bad dancing, and because he tried to steal the gift.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{gained a}} {{considerable}} amount of controversy, largely by Muslims who believed the episode showed Islam in a negative light, and that it could incite Islamophobia. Following the broadcast of the episode on BBC Three, the BBC received around 800 complaints, of which 500 of them were telephone calls, and 300 were emails, and a further 150 complaints were made after the BBC One repeat, totalling nearly one thousand complaints. The complaints made on its original broadcast appealed to the BBC not <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it</b> on BBC One. The corporation chose not to drop the episode from the schedules. However, since fewer complaints were made after the repeat, members of the broadcasters believed that viewers realised the content was not as bad as expected.

[...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it</b> in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added.

He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out.

[...] The second issue was dated Fall 1953; the cover, by Freas, illustrated [...] "Lorelei of the Red Mist", by Bradbury and Leigh Brackett.

500|$|The {{earliest}} international versions {{were what}} then-CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole called [...] "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed {{versions of the}} show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. They utilized a variant of a flexible model called the CTW model, developed by the producers and creators of the original show, to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries. The Workshop recognized that the production model developed in the US, which reflected its needs and culture at the time, served {{as a framework for}} other countries that wanted <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> <b>it.</b> Its inherent flexibility was attractive to producers in other countries, who saw the model as [...] "a methodological approach that is neither doctrinaire nor culture-bound" [...] {{that could be used to}} achieve different results in different countries. According to the 2006 documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the producers of the co-productions repeated the [...] "experiment" [...] undertaken by the original US show, but adapted it to each specific situation. In 1969, the producers of the original show depended upon government and foundation funding, but as Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell stated in 2009, the US funding model would not necessarily be effective in countries with different economic and political structures. All co-productions share elements with the American show, but because of their different needs, no two are exactly alike. According to Gettas, the producers of the programs would [...] "rely on variants of the CTW model to help them create programming that faithfully reflects the linguistic, cultural, social, or religious diversity of their native lands".|$|E
