5|$|The Crusaders oldest rivalry is with <b>the</b> <b>Blues.</b> At {{the start}} of Super Rugby the teams {{originally}} represented 'old foes' Canterbury and Auckland. The two teams have meet twice in the Grand Final, with the Crusaders winning the first meeting in 1998, 20-13. This victory denied <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> a three-peat. However, <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> exacted revenge in 2003, winning the rematch 21-17. However, in recent times the rivalry has cooled, with <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> no longer threatening title challenges, {{as they did in}} their glory days.|$|E

Two other league games were canceled due to inclement weather, and the contest between <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> and White Sox served as the inaugural game of the AL.|$|E
5|$|Stevens' {{time with}} <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> would only last one season. In the offseason {{following}} the 1990–91 NHL season, <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils, who, like Stevens the year before, was a restricted free agent, entitling the Devils to compensation. As <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> still owed first round picks to the Capitals (now five instead of two, as the 1991 pick given up {{ended up being}} the 21st pick), other compensation had to be negotiated, and <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> and Devils could not agree on what the compensation was; <b>the</b> <b>Blues</b> offered goalie Curtis Joseph, forward Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, but the Devils only wanted Stevens. The case went to arbitration, and arbitrator Edward Houston awarded Stevens to the Devils as compensation on September 4, 1991.|$|E
