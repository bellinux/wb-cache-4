5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nature of the cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Fred Donner {{has argued}} {{for an early}} date for the {{collection}} of the Quran, based on his reading of the text itself. He points out that if the Quran had been collected over the tumultuous early centuries of Islam, with their vast conquests and expansion and bloody incidents between rivals for the caliphate, there would have been some evidence of this history in the text. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quran that does not reflect what is known of the earliest Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|Relying on this clause, the Supreme Court {{has held}} that where the marshal {{of a state}} court {{received}} state bank notes in payment and discharge of an execution, the creditor was entitled to demand payment in gold or silver. Since, however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Constitution prohibiting a bank depositor from consenting when he draws a check that payment may be made by draft, a state law providing that checks drawn on local banks should, {{at the option of}} the bank, be payable in exchange drafts was held valid.|$|E
25|$|Muslims {{believe that}} Gabriel brought {{the word of}} God to Muhammad verbatim, without any {{alteration}} or change. The Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text {{and that he had}} no authority to change it (10.15). It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quran that suggests that Muhammad saw God during his revelations. For Muhammad, the revelations were real and he believed the context was objective, but he was only able to describe the experience through metaphorical terms.|$|E

25|$|Yermolai Alexeievitch Lopakhin – a merchant. Lopakhin {{is by far}} {{the wealthiest}} {{character}} in the play, but comes from the lowest social class. This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the high life, {{but at the same time}} is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs, but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic way of doing things.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{was paid}} for {{drilling}} on April 7–8, 1973. That service presumably occurred at his home base, Ellington Air Force Base, in Houston, in contradiction to the information in his performance review. For May 1973, Bush {{was paid for}} service on fifteen days: 1–3, 8–11, 19–20, 22–24, and 29-31. For June, he was paid for five days; for July (his last month of drilling) for 19 days. However <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> released military documents that shows that he actually reported for duty on those days, or exactly where, or what duties he performed. As {{of the end of}} July 1973, Bush had been in the National Guard for a little over five years.|$|E
25|$|Whereas roundarm and overarm {{were highly}} {{controversial}} and {{were introduced in}} the face of fierce opposition, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> historical records which precisely dates the introduction of pitching and nothing which indicates that it was controversial. It has been suggested that the change effectively created a different code of cricket, just as there are now two different codes of rugby football, though in cricket the new completely superseded the old. The two eras are bridged by the career (c.1749 to c.1774) of John Frame, one of the game's first great bowlers, who played with pioneers like Thomas Waymark, Richard Newland and Robert Colchin {{at the beginning of his}} career and with pre-modernists like John Small and Lumpy Stevens at the end.|$|E

25|$|According to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, Amlaíb died around 874–875 in Dollar {{during a}} {{protracted}} campaign against Constantine I of Scotland. These deaths ushered in {{three decades of}} uncertainty for the Norse settlements in Ireland. Internecine conflict between the different factions weakened the colonies and {{made it easier for}} the Irish to unite against them. During this period most of the Norse colonies at Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick fell under the sway of native rulers, as the former allies of the Norsemen turned against them. It has even been claimed that Cerball mac Dúnlainge assumed the kingship of Dublin around this time (possibly with the consent of its Norse inhabitants), but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Irish sources to support this.|$|E
25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sign itself, nor {{in the direction of}} eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need you to go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the grounds of appeal do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E

Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read. At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take, and received a round of applause from the cast and crew. Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: [...] "Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world quite like it." [...] The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.|$|E
