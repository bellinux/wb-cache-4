5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} season with a 3–0 win in the Charity Shield against last season's Premier League runners-up Manchester United. Goals came from Overmars in the first half, Christopher Wreh after 61 minutes and Nicolas Anelka 11 minutes after. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first time that a club from Southern England had won the Shield {{outright}} since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff {{were drawn}} {{at home against}} Burnley in the fourth round.

Their opponents in the quarter-finals were Blackburn Rovers. Two goals from Kenny Miller and Anthony Gerrard secured a 2–0 victory for Cardiff and their progression to the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{distributed}} Disney's shorts for {{two years}} before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process, which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Silly Symphony Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor. Flowers and Trees was a major success, and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.|$|E
5|$|His {{conception}} of 'marvellous reality' {{revolves around the}} natural fantastic qualities of Latin America and the Caribbean, {{as opposed to the}} overly forced and cliché efforts by European surrealists to portray magical occurrences. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> presentation of impossible or fantastic events described as if they were completely usual and natural, such as the metamorphoses of Mackandal and Ti Noel. These events, however, often represent the beliefs of other characters in the novel.

5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington to establish a mint. Feeling that the resolution was inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive law which would govern the new facility. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Mint Act of 1792, which prescribed the specifications of the new US coins, the highest denomination being the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Hayes {{was elected}} {{president}} {{in one of the}} most contentious elections in national history. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J. Tilden but he won an intensely disputed electoral college vote after a Congressional commission awarded him twenty contested electoral votes. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Compromise of 1877, in which the Democrats acquiesced to Hayes's election and Hayes withdrew remaining U.S. troops protecting Republican office holders in the South.|$|E

5|$|In 1900 Liverpool Corporation {{attempted}} {{to acquire the}} entire area to safeguard its water supply, and proposed demolishing the entire village. The Act of Parliament known as the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 protected some buildings but others were left vulnerable. The Act allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase properties in {{the west of the}} village, including the Black-a-Moors Head public house (known locally as the 'Black Lad') and New Hall, which were demolished between 1902 and 1905. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> small settlement that has remained largely unchanged since then.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and {{enlisted the help of}} Ford and H.D. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Imagist Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic weaponry and that it was necessary that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945.|$|E

5|$|In June 1938, the Soviet Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute (RNII) in Moscow was {{authorized}} by the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) to develop a multiple rocket launcher for the RS-132 aircraft rocket (RS for , 'rocket-powered shell'). I. Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk, Russia, which built several prototype launchers firing the modified 132mm M-132 rockets over the sides of ZiS-5 trucks. These proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally. In August 1939, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> BM-13 (BM stands for Боевая Mашина (translit. Boyevaya Mashina), 'combat vehicle' for M-13 rockets).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division in the Wau {{area and}} Major General Horace Fuller's US 41st Infantry Division around Morobe {{were ordered to}} advance on Salamaua so as to {{threaten}} it and draw Japanese forces away from Lae. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> arduous Salamaua Campaign, which was fought between June and September, and which at times looked like succeeding all too well, capturing Salamaua and forcing the Japanese back to Lae, thereby throwing Blamey's whole strategy into disarray.|$|E
