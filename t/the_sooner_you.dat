500|$|Einarr's brother Hallad {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} control in Orkney due to the predations of Danish pirates. He resigned his earldom and returned to Norway as a common landholder, which [...] "everyone thought was a huge joke." [...] Hallad's failure led to Rognvald flying into a rage and summoning his sons Thorir and Hrolluag. He asked which of them wanted the islands but Thorir said the decision {{was up to the}} earl himself. Rognvald predicted that Thorir's path would keep him in Norway and that Hrolluag was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Einarr, the youngest of the natural sons, then came forward and offered to go to the islands. Rognvald said: [...] "Considering the kind of mother you have, slave-born on each side of her family, you are not likely to make much of a ruler. But I agree, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> leave and the later you return the happier I'll be." ...|$|E

Now, Mr. Weld, you know where your room is, and no doubt {{you have your own}} little {{arrangements}} to make. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> make them <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> will feel yourself at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless {{you shall}} take one. You {{will have to}} make other changes besides that; and <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> that <b>you</b> begin to make them the easier they will be to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won't," [...] {{said the}} Bow Street runner doggedly. [...] "Nor yet one of 'em--and it's {{my opinion that}} the coining-gang would be nabbed all <b>the</b> <b>sooner,</b> if <b>you</b> was to give over helping the law to catch them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If I'm {{to answer}} to you for every scalp I choose to lift in self-defence, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> I quit <b>you</b> <b>the</b> better," [...] {{answered}} Larocque sulkily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad I {{finished}} with my lessons," [...] was Dave's comment. [...] "But I am {{sorry for you}} two. But, {{as there is no}} help for it, we might as well get to work. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> begun, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> done, <b>you</b> know."

6000|$|... "Once more I have {{to admire}} the {{discretion}} of all menfolk," [...] she replied. [...] "But if you will not eat, off with you at once; you will be back <b>the</b> <b>sooner,</b> for <b>you</b> go on a fool's errand.

"Well, sir! the {{grandson}} is born {{the day the}} grandfather dies! a cloudy morning has often a bright sunset' and though we are now sticking in a ditch, by the aid of St. Florian we may be soon feasting in a castle! Come, my merry men, I did not bring you here to show your ribbons; <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> help {{us out of this}} scrape <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> will be again dancing with the pretty maidens on the green!

6000|$|... 'Well, then, don't you pay in {{no more of}} your words, Captain,' {{retorted}} the roused innocent, getting louder in his whine, and backing into <b>the</b> shop. 'I'd <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> took {{my blood}} than my character.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have a very}} {{promising}} case of fever coming on. Get up and lean on me; <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> we pack <b>you</b> between the blankets the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid we}} can't {{get rid of}} our faults quite so easily; I wish we could: but I do {{believe that if you}} keep saying that, and trying to stop, you will cure <b>the</b> habit <b>sooner</b> than <b>you</b> think." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is hardly}} worth while to ask, {{considering}} your experience in such affairs. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>you</b> begin and finish, the better I'll be pleased," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{considered}} the point; and as you are the person likely to be inconvenienced by its publication, I am bound to let you conceal it for the present, if you wish to. It must transpire sometime: <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> better. <b>You</b> will feel uncomfortably deceitful with such a secret; and as for me, every time your father greets me cordially in the City I shall feel mean. However, you can watch for your opportunity. Let me know at once when the cat {{comes out of the}} bag." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Master Walcott, {{the enemy}} has retreated. Victoria! And now, I see, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> I get <b>you</b> to your chamber, the better," [...] added he aside; for the wine was at last {{beginning}} to produce its legitimate effect, in stupefying the young man's mental and bodily faculties.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you want}} to go home in the chaise, and coax the letters from him! Delilah! Well, they can be no good to me, and I trust you may get them. When will <b>you</b> go? <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>the</b> better, <b>you</b> say? We are women of the world, Maria. We only call names when we are in a passion. We don't want each other's company; and we part on good terms. Shall we go to my Lady Yarmouth's? 'Tis her night.

6000|$|Colonel Woodburn cut in. [...] "You couldn't do that, Mr. Dryfoos, {{under your}} system. And if you {{attempted}} it, with your conspiracy laws, {{and that kind}} of thing, it might bring <b>the</b> climax <b>sooner</b> than <b>you</b> expected. Your commercialized society has built its house on the sands. It will have to go. But I should be sorry if it went before its time." ...|$|R
60|$|TROTTER. I cant {{possibly}} {{tell you}} what I shall say to your father about the play until Ive seen the play. But I'll {{tell you what}} I shall say to him about you.

6000|$|... "Von Duyk!" [...] {{the earl}} said. [...] "She {{must be a}} {{daughter}} of the great merchant of Dort--a useful friend to have made, maybe, Master Holliday; {{and it may be}} that your adventure may even be of service to the state. Never speak now, Master Rupert, of your peaceful intentions. You take after your namesake, the Prince, and are a veritable knight errant of adventure. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> I have <b>you</b> over in Holland fighting the queen's enemies, and not the queen's subjects, the better.|$|R
6000|$|I {{want you}} to come home, my dear old comrade, and to buy a house [...] near here.

Good [...] is coming, and George; and so, by the way, is your boy Harry [...] (there's a bribe for you). I have had him down for a week's [...] shooting, and like him. He is a cool young hand; he shot me in the [...] leg, cut out the pellets, and then remarked upon the {{advantages}} of [...] having a medical student with every shooting party! ...|$|R
5000|$|... Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{called for}} [...] "dialogue and calm" [...] in {{response}} to the Quran burnings and subsequent protests.
