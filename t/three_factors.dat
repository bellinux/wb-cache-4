5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{enjoys a}} large range and a big {{population}}. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact {{of global climate change}} on the population dynamics of the black-throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied in relation to the survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the <b>three</b> <b>factors</b> were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue warbler population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Size {{and book}} to market ratio are both highly {{correlated}} with the average returns of common stocks. Fama and French (1993) argue that these effects are proxies for factors of risk. In this study, we try to test the <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model of Fama and French and the Capital Asset Pricing Model on French Stock Market. We use returns on the Fama and French six portfolios sorted by size and book to market ratio. The sample is from July 1976 to June 2001. Our {{results show that the}} <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model explains better the common variation in stock returns than the capital asset pricing model. Moreover, both the CAPM and the <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model do a good job in explaining the cross section of stock returns. We test the <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model with a set of market portfolios and we show that all market portfolios capture the common variation in stock returns. However, only the value-weight market portfolio can explain the cross-section in the stock returns.

Both time series regressions and Cross sectional regressions are conducted to test whether one model always works better than the other model.

In addition, the proposed conceptual model had a good fit. The results also supported two hypothetical relationships among <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> packages: (1) the increase of the affordability of the target tenants had a positive effect on the increase of profits of private sectors; and (2) the increase of the affordability of the target tenants had a positive effect on the increase of level of the characteristics of PRH units.

40|$|This study {{uses the}} numeraire {{portfolio}} to benchmark insurance stock returns {{as a natural}} measure for detecting abnormal insurance stock returns from catastrophic events. The assumptions underlying the efficient markets hypothesis using a numeraire denominated returns approach hold for catastrophic insurance events whereas other more traditional methods such as the market model and Fama-French <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model often fail, typically due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We construct a portfolio of Australian insurance firms and observe the market reaction to major insured catastrophic events. Using the numeraire denominated returns approach we observe no particular trend in the cumulative abnormal returns of insurance securities following a catastrophic event. Using both the traditional market model and the Fama-French <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model however, we observe significantly positive cumulative abnormal returns following an insured catastrophic event. The errors inherent in the market model and <b>three</b> <b>factor</b> model for event studies are shown to be eliminated using the numeraire denominated returns approach.
