The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. The back cover of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, always carried a full page Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E

25|$|Currency had not {{yet been}} invented, so Assyrian merchants used gold for {{wholesale}} trade and silver for retail trade during this time. Gold was considered eight times more valuable than silver. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> metal, amutum, which was even more valuable than gold. Amutum is thought to be the newly discovered iron and was forty times more valuable than silver. The most important Anatolian export was copper, and the Assyrian merchants sold tin and clothing to Anatolia.|$|E

Ilaiyaraaja joined Dhanraj Master as a student to learn musical {{instruments}} and the master renamed and called him as just [...] "Raaja". In his first movie Annakili, Tamil film producer Panchu Arunachalam added [...] "Ilaiya" [...] (Ilaiya means younger in Tamil language) as prefix in his name Raaja and he named as [...] "Ilaiyaraaja" [...] because in the 1970s <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> music director A.

Nos. 213 and 602 Squadrons were patrolling nearby at Tangmere, where they were kept {{for the duration of the}} raid. No. 607 Squadron, also from Tangmere, was flying to the airfield over Southampton at [...] and No. 609 Squadron was on its way from Middle Wallop to patrol Portsmouth. At 18:00, by which time the German operation was virtually over, the British dispositions were completed when No. 238 Squadron took off from Middle Wallop to patrol the airfield.|$|E
500|$|The {{first five}} stages {{took place in}} and around Andalusia in {{southern}} Spain; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there. The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Banús to Marbella. The next four stages were fairly flat, although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb. The sixth stage started in Córdoba and finished in Sierra de Cazorla in Jaén on another moderately difficult climb. The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race: the first-category summit finish at La Alpujarra. The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain, with a medium-mountain seventh stage and another first-category summit finish at Benitachell on Stage 9. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> medium-mountain stage on Stage 10, taking the riders into the Province of Castellón. This {{was followed by a}} transfer that took the riders into Andorra for a three-day spell, beginning with the first rest day. The eleventh stage took place entirely in Andorra; though it was only [...] in length, it included six categorised climbs, including a summit finish, and was described by Eusebio Unzué (the manager of the Movistar team) as [...] "the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years". Stage 12 took the riders back into Spain for a fairly flat stage, before three consecutive stages with summit finishes. These took place in the mountains of Cantabria and Asturias and were followed by the race's second rest day. The final week of the race included no summit finishes: the first stage was a [...] individual time trial in Burgos and was then followed by three mixed stages that took the riders nearer to the final stage of the race, a sprint stage in Madrid. For the first time, the race organisers also held a women's race on the same day as the final stage, using the same circuit. This race – called La Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta – was won by Shelley Olds.|$|E

Following a few live dates in England, California returned to the United States and resumed touring extensively with Cassidy, Monahan, and Waterbury. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> solo album from California: a collection of material entitled Shattered Dreams that was released in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, a new Negro league, the East-West League, {{was founded}} with the Detroit Wolves as the Detroit franchise. [...] The Wolves played their home games in Hamtramck Stadium; however, {{the league and}} the Wolves quickly went bust. [...] The Detroit Stars were reconstituted in 1933, also playing at Hamtramck Stadium, but lasted just one season. [...] In the same year, John Roesnick had tax {{problems}} and lost control of Hamtramck Stadium. [...] The fate of the park became an issue in 1935 when Gus Greenlee wanted to move the Nashville Elite Giants to Detroit; with no park available, the franchise wound up in Columbus, Ohio instead. [...] Still, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> Negro League season at Hamtramck Stadium in 1937, when the Detroit Stars were again reconstituted. As before, the club folded after a single year.|$|E
2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> notable use of LCAs {{in the war}} {{in northwestern}} Europe: the fierce {{fighting}} around Walcheren Island and the Western Scheldt (Battle of the Scheldt). Though by mid-September 1944, most amphibious assets had been sent to the Mediterranean for Dragoon, the Royal Navy still had 70 LCAs in Portsmouth. Because the approaches precluded the use of destroyers to support the assault, the presence of LCSs and other support craft was vital in providing covering fire and warding off German craft. The low speed of the LCA made the navigation plans and timing of the infantry assault more challenging due to the Scheldt's 4 and [...] currents. Still, No. 4 Commando got ashore from the bullet-proof LCA under heavy fire with only two or three casualties. The LCA containing the heavier equipment was sunk by an anti-invasion obstacle. Two hours later, the 5th King's Own Scottish Borderers were also landed from LCAs at Flushing. During the balance of the operations around Walcheren, LCAs were used to ferry troops through the river network and the extensive flooded areas.|$|E

2500|$|Balmoral Place {{was about}} two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main {{reception}} behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going {{up the steps to}} the first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> set of stairs at the rear of the police station. Letters from local residents in the Press i.e. [...] "The Halifax Courier", wrote that a measure of much needed discipline continue in the Halifax Force. Richardson was considered to be the man to bring this about and he had acquired the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian which continued throughout his career. He presented his first financial accounts to the Halifax Watch Committee on 28 September 1903 where the cost of the Constabulary per week averaged £164.1s.7d. The Police were paid weekly at this time. Within weeks Richardson persuaded the Watch Committee to purchase a Black Maria, a horse and a secure trailer fitted with lockable cubicles for transporting prisoners to and from the court in Halifax to Leeds prison. He insisted the design was adjusted so that it could rapidly become an ambulance should the need arise. In 1905 he attended a meeting in Bradford of the Chief Constables Association. An official photograph by the CCA shows him, his father and his brother among 40 attendees. A similar meeting of Chief Constables in the Association took place in Brighton, Sussex, in 1906, which he attended. In August 1905 after a recommendation from the Chief Constables report of the time, the Halifax force was increased by six additional constables.|$|E
