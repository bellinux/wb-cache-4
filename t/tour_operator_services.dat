30|$|Why {{does such}} a {{potentially}} profitable enterprise bring so little local benefit? These communities have historically captured little of total tourism earnings, with approximately 95 % accruing to <b>tour</b> <b>operators,</b> <b>service</b> industry workers, {{and the state}} (Norton-Griffiths 2007; Norton-Griffiths et al. 2008; Norton-Griffiths and Said 2010). The small amounts captured are then poorly distributed (Homewood and Thompson 2010). Proportions captured by local residents are even lower in Tanzania (Sachedina 2008) as they trickle through official channels, top-sliced at each stage from central and district governments through to the communal level via WMAs.|$|R

40|$|Discussion {{about the}} experiential aspects of {{consumption}} in academia is constantly evolving, {{and the experience}} economy {{has been identified as}} an important facet of the present-day situation. The experience economy reflects a wide range of concepts that have been proposed in previous research. In the tourism domain, tourists have become accustomed to desire subjective and memorable experiences to create overall satisfaction and encourage them to repurchase tourist products. However, the investigation of service experiences for tourists is still in its infancy. This study explores service experiences in the context of package tours, specifically inbound package tours to China from the USA. The findings clarify the emergence of the experience economy. In the second-order model derived from the results, the service experience is decomposed into four dimensions, including "recognition and escapism", "peace of mind and relaxation", "hedonics" and "involvement", which have direct influences on overall tourist satisfaction and behavioral intention. The managerial implications of the findings in terms of the benefits extractable by <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> and <b>service</b> providers are discussed. This exploratory attempt will provide a reference point for future researchers who are interested in tapping into the area of study. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{slowness}} of diffusion of electronic commerce (EC), particularly in the business-to-consumer side. The theme is approached by analysing emerging Web-services in the travel services industry. We report on a field study of Web-sites of 294 travel agencies, <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> and transportation <b>services</b> companies. By surveying and evaluating the current services we hope to shed {{new light on the}} reasons behind the slow proliferation of consumer oriented EC. The results show that, in spite of high rate of Internet connections, the services offered by Finnish travel industry companies still lag behind their American counterparts. The major reasons are related to incompleteness of electronic services provided. In most cases, consumers find the traditional systems more convenient to use than the emerging Internet-based services still requiring additional contacts to branch offices and based on traditional ways of offering travel services. Other obstacles are related to lack of trust in payment systems and inadequately used capabilities of the Web...|$|R

40|$|Developments in {{information}} and communication technology have opened up new possibilities for local <b>tour</b> <b>operators.</b> However, many small <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> are faced with problems regarding the marketing of their products and services, especially problems relating to the choice of distribution channels. This study therefore undertakes {{a survey of the}} place and role of <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> in the tourism industry, before investigating the different distribution channels available to <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> as well as the factors that influence a <b>tour</b> <b>operator’s</b> choice of distribution channels. This is done by means of a literature study and a brief investigative questionnaire submitted to a number of small <b>tour</b> <b>operators.</b> The study concludes that the different situations pertaining to different small <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> make it impossible to determine a set of distribution channels applicable to every <b>tour</b> <b>operator.</b> However, it identifies a number of considerations that individual <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> can take into account to support their choice of distribution channels, taking cognisance of their unique situations. These include factors like the target market selected, positioning and the establishment of a trade mark, quality of service, specialisation, the nature of the destination and the background of the tourists, control over the marketing process, {{information and communication}}, cost-efficiency, and pragmatic considerations.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine how}} a <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> works to {{implement}} sustainability {{in the development}} of the business, as well as what significance it has to consumers in selecting a <b>tour</b> <b>operator.</b> Furthermore, the purpose is to provide recommendations on how <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> should work to communicate their commitments. Methodology: The research strategy applied is a case study which follows an abductive approach. Qualitative and quantitative methods were applied to complement each other. A semi-structured interview with a <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> and a consumer survey constitute the empirical foundation. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study is that consumers show a positive attitude towards CSR, but do not see it as a determinant when choosing a <b>tour</b> <b>operator.</b> Thus, CSR does not constitute a competitive advantage against competitors. However, that is not to say a <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> can choose not to part take in acts for sustainability since the risk of negative publicity would increase remarkably, as well as loss of legitimacy. Consequently, CSR could be moving towards something consumers take for granted and expect <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> to work with...|$|R
