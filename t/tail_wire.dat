50|$|Both {{versions}} of the CycloCrane were 178 ft (54.25 m) long. The first version, completed in 1982 had four piston engines and was fitted with a large, inverted Y shaped tail needed to stabilise it at its moorings by keeping it pointed into wind. That version was destroyed at its moorings in a storm and was never flown. It was rebuilt by 1984 and fitted with an 18 faceted, ring shaped <b>tail</b> <b>wire</b> braced to the central axis. The aerostats in both versions were 68 ft 0 in (20.73 m) in diameter and 136 ft 0 in (41.45 m) long and manufactured by ILC Dover of Frederica, Delaware, USA. Partly to save weight, this version had only two engines, a pair of 150 hp (112 kW) Textron Lycoming AEIO-320 horizontally opposed piston engines driving 4-bladed propellers. This left the CycloCrane rather underpowered, particularly in lift.|$|E
50|$|Tiger <b>tail</b> <b>wire</b> (also simply called tiger tail or tiger-tail) {{is a kind}} of {{thin wire}} encased in nylon often used in beaded jewellery, and that is {{particularly}} suited to stringing heavy beads and sharp beads, which tend to fray other kinds of thread. For this reason, tiger tail is the thread of choice for gemstones. Some tiger tail has multiple intertwined wire threads under the nylon coating. The wire threads are made of stainless steel. Tiger tail cannot be fashioned into a knot in order to end a sequence of beads as other kinds of thread can, therefore crimp beads are often used for this purpose instead. Crimp beads are also used as spacers between other beads strung on tiger tail. Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail is the most common. Tiger tail is easier to use than many other kinds of thread, and it does not require the use of a sewing needle. Tiger tail has high ultimate tensile strength and is therefore extremely difficult to tear, but if it is creased or twisted, tiger tail has a tendency to kink and then become brittle in the kinked area.|$|E
50|$|An {{extraordinary}} courtship {{display is}} {{performed by the}} male {{with a series of}} tail swinging, fluffing of the white abdominal feathers that makes the bird look like a cottonball, and acrobatic movements of their elongated <b>tail</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The emperor bird-of-paradise is large, {{approximately}} 33 cm long, {{yellow and}} brown with a reddish-brown iris, bluish-grey bill and purplish-brown legs.

50|$|Despite winning several {{international}} awards, The Dark Hours (like many Canadian films) {{received no}} U.S. distribution beyond a one-week {{run at the}} indie-friendly Pioneer cinema in NYC. In his book The Long <b>Tail,</b> <b>Wired</b> editor Chris Anderson states that the film suffered {{more than any other}} film released that year from the inefficiencies of theatrical distribution. A further review on his blog confirmed his judgement that the film did not lack for quality at all, only for marketing and distribution.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wire-tailed swallow}} {{is a small}} swallow, {{measuring}} 18 cm in length. It has bright blue upperparts, bright white underparts and a chestnut cap. Immature birds lack <b>tail</b> <b>wires,</b> and have dull brown (rather than chestnut) caps. The species is named for the very long filamentous outermost tail feathers, which trail behind like two wires. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the female has shorter [...] "wires". Juveniles have a brown crown, back and tail. The Asian form, H. s. filifera, is larger and longer-tailed than the abundant African H. s. smithii.|$|R
50|$|The greater bird-of-paradise is {{the largest}} member in the genus Paradisaea, with males {{measuring}} up to 43 cm (excluding the long twin <b>tail</b> <b>wires).</b> The female is smaller, at only 35 cm. The plumage of this species is also sexually dimorphic. The male has an iridescent green face and a yellow glossed with silver iridescence crown, head and nape. The {{rest of the body}} plumage is maroon-brown. The flank plumes, used in displays, are yellow at the base, turning white and streaked with maroon. The female has unbarred maroon brown plumage. In both sexes the iris is yellow and the bills blue.|$|R
50|$|Large, up to 33 cm long, {{brown and}} yellow {{with a dark}} brown iris, grey legs and yellow bill. The male has an emerald green face, a pair of {{elongated}} black corkscrew-shaped <b>tail</b> <b>wires,</b> dark green feather pompoms above each eye and a train of glossy crimson red plumes with whitish tips at {{either side of the}} breast. The male measures up to 72 cm long, including the ornamental red plumes that require at least six years to fully attain. The female is similar but smaller in size, with a dark brown face and has no ornamental red plumes. The diet consists mainly of fruits, berries and arthropods.|$|R
50|$|The Raggiana bird-of-paradise is 34 cm long. Its {{overall colour}} is a maroon-brown, with a greyish-blue bill, yellow iris and greyish-brown feet. The male has a yellow crown, dark emerald-green throat and yellow collar between {{the throat and}} its blackish upper breast feathers. It is adorned {{with a pair of}} long black <b>tail</b> <b>wires</b> and large flank plumes. The male has the long tail feather while the female does not.. The female is a {{comparatively}} drab maroonish-brown bird. The ornamental flank plumes vary from red to orange in color, depending on subspecies. The nominate subspecies, P. r. raggiana, has the deepest red plumes, while the subspecies P. r. augustavictoriae of northeast New Guinea, also known as the Empress of Germanys bird of paradise, has apricot-orange plumes.|$|R
60|$|This {{exquisite}} little creature frequents {{the smaller}} {{trees in the}} thickest parts of the forest, feeding on various fruits; often {{of a very large}} size for so small a bird. It is very active both on its wings and feet, and makes a whirring sound while flying, something like the South American manakins. It often flutters its wings and displays the beautiful fan which adorns its breast, while the star-bearing <b>tail</b> <b>wires</b> diverge in an elegant double curve. It is tolerably plentiful in the Aru Islands, which led to it, being brought to Europe at an early period along with Paradisea apoda. It also occurs in the island of Mysol and in every part of New Guinea which has been visited by naturalists.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} step the machine pays out a small length of wire and tears the wire from the surface using a set of clamps. This leaves a small <b>tail</b> of <b>wire</b> hanging {{from the end of}} the capillary. The cycle then starts again with the {{high-voltage}} electric charge being applied to this tail.|$|R

The dressing is simple: size 8 to 14 hook, brown thread, a few barbs of brown hackle for the <b>tail,</b> copper <b>wire,</b> a few barbs of peacock herl for the body, and tying thread for the head.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{a conventional}} landing gear equipped, single seat, open cockpit biplane, with a fuselage constructed from welded steel tubing with aircraft fabric covering and spruce wing spars.

50|$|While the Sakasa Kebari tends {{toward a}} simplistic tying {{approach}} {{there are many}} variants that are more complex. Some {{use a combination of}} silk, pheasant <b>tail</b> fibers, <b>wire</b> ribbing, and other materials to construct the body. While most are unweighted, bead heads and lead wrapping can be used to apply weight so the fly can be fished deeper than otherwise possible. While the Sakasa Kebari is usually associated with being a wet fly (a fly that is fished beneath the surface) it can also be fished dry (on the surface) simply by modifying technique, applying floatant, or even using a dry fly hackle instead of the standard wet fly hackle.|$|R
60|$|These splendid {{ornaments}} {{are entirely}} {{confined to the}} male sex, while the female is really a very plain and ordinary-looking bird of a uniform coffee-brown colour which never changes, neither does she possess the long <b>tail</b> <b>wires,</b> nor a single yellow or green feather about the dead. The young males {{of the first year}} exactly resemble the females, so that they can only be distinguished by dissection. The first change is the acquisition of the yellow and green colour on the head and throat, {{and at the same time}} the two middle tail feathers grow a few inches longer than the rest, but remain webbed on both sides. At a later period these feathers are replaced by the long bare shafts of the full length, as in the adult bird; but there is still no sign of the magnificent orange side-plumes, which later still complete the attire of the perfect male. To effect these changes there must be at least three successive moultings; and as the birds were found by me in all the stages about the same time, it is probable that they moult only once a year, and that the full plumage is not acquired till the bird is four years old. It was long thought that the fine train of feathers was assumed for a short time only at the breeding season, but my own experience, as well as the observation of birds of an allied species which I brought home with me, and which lived two years in this country, show that the complete plumage is retained during the whole year, except during a short period of moulting as with most other birds.|$|R

5000|$|... coils - These {{are used}} for AVF, aneurysms, or trauma. They are very good for fast-flowing vessels because they {{immediately}} clot the vessel. They are made from platinum or stainless steel. They induce clots due to the Dacron wool <b>tails</b> around the <b>wire.</b> The coil itself will not cause mechanical occlusion. Since it is made of metal, it is easily seen in radiographic images. The disadvantage is that large coils can disrupt the radiographic image. The coil may also lose its shape if the catheter is kinked. Also, {{there is a small}} risk of dislodging from the deployed location.|$|R
5000|$|Initially the pilot's {{seat was}} mounted {{well below the}} wing leading edge on the narrow edge of a board or plank. The under edge of this board was shaped to curve up {{forwards}} {{and served as a}} skid. The board was fixed to the wing spars by two pairs of parallel V-form lift struts, the angle between them being unusually small. This arrangement left the pilot completely exposed and a later version placed him in a short nacelle. [...] Both wings and <b>tail</b> were further <b>wire</b> braced, with lift wires from the fuselage and above from a pair of inverted V-struts mounted on the two boom beams.|$|R
50|$|Attached {{immediately}} {{behind the}} single open cockpit headrest at the forward wing spar, the nacelle extended rearwards {{only to the}} wing trailing edge, suspended from an inverted V pair of struts to the rear spar. A landing skid extended {{over most of the}} length of the nacelle. Aft of the nacelle, the fuselage was an uncovered converging Warren girder structure carrying the tail surfaces and braced laterally by wires to the mid-span wing points. The fin was very small but carried an almost rectangular rudder which extended to the fuselage keel via a cut-out in the elevators. The tailplane was straight tapered, with a swept leading edge. A <b>wire</b> <b>tail</b> bumper completed the undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|The {{plan was}} that the <b>wire</b> <b>tail</b> would be dragged for about 30 mi across the {{countryside}} and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line. A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 ft long were initiated by the wire. The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; {{there was a good}} chance the circuit breaker itself would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different overcurrent protection settings had any useful effect.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first two}} or three days of our stay here were very wet, and I {{obtained}} but few insects or birds, but at length, when I was beginning to despair, my boy Baderoon returned one day with a specimen which repaid me for months of delay and expectation. It was a small bird a little less than a thrush. The greater part of its plumage was of an intense cinnabar red, with a gloss as of spun glass. On the head the feathers became short and velvety, and shaded into rich orange. Beneath, from the breast downwards, was pure white, with the softness and gloss of silk, and across the breast a band of deep metallic green separated this colour from the red of the throat. Above each eye was a round spot of the same metallic green; the bill was yellow, and the feet and legs were of a fine cobalt óille, strikingly contrasting with all the other parts of the body. Merely in arrangement of colours and texture of plumage this little bird was a gem of the first water, yet there comprised only half its strange beauty. Springing from each side of the breast, and ordinarily lying concealed under the wings, were little tufts of greyish feathers about two inches long, and each terminated by a broad band of intense emerald green. These plumes can be raised at the will of the bird, and spread out into a pair of elegant fans when the wings are elevated. But this is not the only ornament. The two middle feathers of the tail are in the form of slender wires about five inches long, and which diverge in a beautiful double curve. About half an inch of the end of this wire is webbed on the outer side only, awe coloured of a fine metallic green, and being curled spirally inwards form a pair of elegant glittering buttons, hanging five inches below the body, and the same distance apart. These two ornaments, the breast fans and the spiral tipped <b>tail</b> <b>wires,</b> are altogether unique, not occurring on any other species of the eight thousand different birds that are known to exist upon the earth; and, combined with the most exquisite beauty of plumage, render this one of the most perfectly lovely of the many lovely productions of nature. My transports of admiration and delight quite amused my Aru hosts, who saw nothing more in the [...] "Burong raja" [...] than we do in the robin of the goldfinch.|$|R
5000|$|Donald Aydlett began {{construction}} of the sole A-1 in 1963, flying it on 6 July 1965. [...] It was a low wing monoplane of mixed wood and steel construction. The wing was a fabric covered wood structure, with [...] lift struts from the upper fuselage longerons. The fuselage and tail unit were steel, again fabric covered, and the <b>tail</b> unit was <b>wire</b> braced. The tailplane {{was on top of}} the fuselage; the rounded fin carried a generous, unbalanced rudder. The cockpit, over the wing, was enclosed by a canopy which merged at the rear with the raised fuselage decking. Power came from a 125 hp (93 kW) flat four Lycoming O-290-G, mounted with cylinder heads and exhaust pipes exposed. The A-1 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels mounted on faired V-struts and a tailwheel.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} methods developed to increase {{the quality of the}} crescent bond together with the tail bond quality. Low pull force of the crescent bond limits the usage of insulated Au wire in microelectronics assembly. Premature break of the tail which results in the stoppage of the bonding machine is one of obstacles to overcome for Cu wire. The primary focus of this thesis is to understand the tail and crescent bonding process and then to propose methodologies to improve thermosonic wire bonding processes when Cu and insulated Au wires are used. Several series of experiments to investigate the crescent and tail bonding processes are performed on auto bonders. Cu and insulated Au wires with diameters of 25 mm are bonded on the diepads of Ag leadframes. For simplicity, wire loops are oriented perpendicular to the ultrasonic direction. It was found that the crescent bond breaking force by pulling the wire loop (pull force) with insulated Au wire is about 80 % of that of bare Au wire. A modification of the crescent bonding process is made to increase the pull force with insulated Au wire. In the modified process, an insulation layer removing stage (cleaning stage) is inserted before the bonding stage. The cleaning stage consists of a scratching motion (shift) toward to the ball bond in combination with ultrasound. Bonds are then made on the fresh diepad with the insulation removed from the contact surface of the insulated Au wire. This process increases the pull force of the crescent bond up to 26 % which makes it comparable to the results obtained with bare Au <b>wire.</b> An online <b>tail</b> breaking force measurement method is developed with a proximity sensor between wire clamp and horn. Detailed understanding of tail bond formation is achieved by studying tail bond imprints with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Descriptions are given of the dependence of the tail breaking force on the bonding parameters, metallization variation, and cleanliness of the bond pad. Simultaneous optimization with pull force and tail breaking force can optimize the Cu wire bonding process both with high quality and robustness. It is recommended to first carry out conventional pull force optimization followed by a minimization of the bonding force parameter to the lowest value still fulfilling the pull force cpk requirement. The tail bond forms not only under the capillary chamfer, but also under the capillary hole. The tail breaking force includes both the interfacial bond breaking strength and the breaking strength of the thinned portion of the wire that will remain at the substrate as residue. Close investigations of the tail bond imprint with scanning electron microscopy indicate the presence of fractures of the substrate indicating substrate material being picked up by Cu <b>wire</b> <b>tail.</b> Pick up is found on Au and Cu wires, but the amount of pick up is much larger on Cu wire. The effect on the hardness of the subsequently formed Cu free air ball (FAB) as investigated with scanning electron microscopy and micro - hardness test shows that Cu FABs containing Au and Ag pick ups are softer than those without pick up. However, the hardness varies significantly more with Au pick up. The amount of Au pick up is estimated higher than 0. 03 % of the subsequently formed FAB volume, exceeding typical impurity and dopant concentrations (0. 01 %) added during manufacturing of the wire...|$|R
