5|$|The {{financial}} services industry {{is important to}} Boston, especially involving mutual funds and insurance. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Boston was ranked as having the ninth most competitive financial center {{in the world and}} the fourth most competitive in the United States. Boston-based Fidelity Investments helped popularize <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> in the 1980s and has made Boston one of the top financial centers in the United States. The city is home to the headquarters of Santander Bank, and Boston is a center for venture capital firms. State Street Corporation, which specializes in asset management and custody services, is based in the city. Boston is a printing and publishing center—Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is headquartered within the city, along with Bedford-St. Martin's Press and Beacon Press. Pearson PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city is home to three major convention centers—the Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay, and the Seaport World Trade Center and Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront. The General Electric Corporation announced in January 2016 its decision to move the company's global headquarters to the Seaport District in Boston, from Fairfield, Connecticut, citing factors including Boston's preeminence in the realm of higher education. Boston is home to the headquarters of several major athletic and footwear companies including Converse, New Balance, and Reebok. Rockport, PUMA and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. headquarters or regional offices are located just outside the city.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect a non-taxable redemption of a creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|E

Unexposed insider trading, accounting fraud, embezzlement and pump and dump strategies are factors that hamper an efficient, rational, fair and transparent investing, because they may create fictitious company's financial statements and data, leading to inconsistent stock prices.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, {{after years}} of {{economic}} downturn, Boston boomed again. Financial institutions were granted more latitude, more people began to play the market, and Boston became a leader in <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> industry. Health care became more extensive and expensive, and hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital {{led the nation in}} medical innovation and patient care. Higher education also became more expensive, and universities such as Harvard, MIT, Boston College, BU and Tufts attracted hordes of students to the Boston area; many stayed and became permanent residents. MIT graduates, in particular, founded many successful high-tech companies, which made Boston second only to Silicon Valley as a high-tech center.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} with mutual fund trading that cast market timing {{in a negative}} light occurred because the prospectuses written by <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> companies strictly forbid short-term trading. Despite this prohibition, special clients were allowed to do it anyway. So, the problem was not with the trading strategy but rather with the unethical and unfair implementation of that strategy, which permitted some investors to engage in it while excluding others. All of the world's greatest investors rely, to some extent, on market timing for their success. Whether they base their buy-sell decisions on fundamental analysis of the markets, technical analysis of individual companies, personal intuition, {{or all of the}} above, the ultimate reason for their success involves making the right trades at the right time. In most cases, those decisions involve extended periods of time and are based on buy-and-hold investment strategies. Value investing is a clear example, as the strategy is based on buying stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic values and selling them when their value is recognized in the marketplace. Most value investors are known for their patience, as undervalued stocks often remain undervalued for significant periods of time.|$|E

Norwegian <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> invest in companies, which are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> invest in companies in USA, Europe, Asia and South America. This study examines the riskadjusted returns using Sharpe’s ratio, Treynor’s ratio, Jensen’s measure, Appraisal Ratio and Modigliani and Modigliani measure for these Norwegian and Global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> <b>The</b> analysis will focus on the funds performances in the form of risk-adjusted return. In the empirical examination, I have used arithmetic risk-adjusted monthly return. The purpose is to compare the performances of global <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> and domestic <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> and seeks to test whether <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> achieve a higher risk-adjusted excess return than the market and if <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> have <b>the</b> same risk profile and investment strategy as they claim.

The performance evaluation methods, which are used to rank <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> in this thesis, have strong positive correlation. This adds robustness to my results.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> {{regulation}} in Middle Eastern countries is still insufficient and lacks the detailed rules that regulate {{all aspects of}} <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> industry. Despite <b>the</b> fact that <b>the</b> current <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> regulation addresses {{different aspects of the}} fund industry, it is still far from the international standards applied in many countries such as the UK and the USA. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of exporting certain essential regulatory rules form <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> {{regulation in}} <b>the</b> UK to <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> regulation in Middle Eastern countries in order to enhance investors’ protection. Enhancing <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> regulations generally and investors protection particularly would accelerate the development of <b>the</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> industry in those countries. The first chapter of the thesis is an introduction. The second chapter defines <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> by showing their significant role in the financial market and showing their unique attributes which differentiate them from other financial institutions. The third chapter scrutinises <b>the</b> existing <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> laws and regulations and their amendments in the UK, namely the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the Open Ended Investments Companies Regulations 2001 and the Financial Conduct Authority Sourcebook. The fourth chapter examines <b>the</b> governance of <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> under <b>the</b> current legal framework in the UK. The fifth chapter focuses on how the features discussed in the previous chapters could be used in Middle Eastern countries. Finally, chapter six provides the general conclusion of the thesis and the contribution of this research. The findings from the research show that the unique nature of <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> as useful financial institutions comes from the combination of the advantages offered to the investors by one financial institution. They also illustrate that <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> in <b>the</b> UK are governed by a robust legal framework that regulates nearly all aspects of the industry in detail. This legal framework adopts efficient governance mechanisms that provide investors {{with a high level of}} protection. The governance mechanisms ensure investors protection and play a key role in mitigating the potential conflicts of interests between the self-interests of the fund management and the interests of the investors. Another important finding of the research is that <b>the</b> current <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> regulations in Middle Eastern countries lack the detailed rules, and they do not regulate all aspects of <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> industry. Therefore, <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> investors are not well protected. Finally, the research shows that certain regulatory rules form the UK regulations are exportable to Syrian <b>Mutual</b> <b>funds</b> regulations and can be exportable to Middle Eastern countries.
