25|$|After {{the failed}} {{regicide}} {{the security of}} the king was questioned, because <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landaus was 2cm thick. Elsewhere in Europe, the news of this assassination attempt was received with alarm; other heads of state and the pope sent telegrams to the king congratulating him for surviving the assassination attempt. Many people remembered the earlier assassinations of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Umberto I of Italy by other Italian anarchists.|$|E
25|$|The {{club has}} always been noted for its wealthy members, grand banquets and boisterous rituals, such as vandalising ('trashing') of {{restaurants}} and college rooms, complemented by a tradition of on-the-spot payment for damage. Its ostentatious display of wealth attracts controversy, since many ex-members have moved up to high political posts, most notably former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. A number of episodes over many decades have provided anecdotal evidence of the Club's behaviour. Infamously on 12 May 1894, after dinner, Bullingdon members smashed almost all <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lights and 468 windows in Peckwater Quad of Christ Church, along with the blinds and doors of the building, and again on 20 February 1927. As a result, the Club was banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford.|$|E

[...] The light passing through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity {{at the moment of}} conception, a device also found in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling [...] "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} from the Raw brand was the Elimination Chamber {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The match began with Jericho and Michaels in the ring, while Goldberg, Nash, Orton, and Triple H were locked in the chambers. Michaels and Jericho wrestled, with neither of them gaining the {{advantage}} over the other. Orton and Nash were {{the third and fourth}} entrants into the match, respectively. Nash was the first wrestler eliminated from the match after Michaels executed a superkick and Chris Jericho covered him for a pinfall. Triple H and Goldberg were the fifth and sixth entrants. Michaels performed another superkick on Triple H as soon as he exited his chamber, and as a result, Triple H was knocked back into his chamber. As soon as Goldberg entered the match, he performed a spear for a pinfall to eliminate Orton. Next, Goldberg performed a Jackhammer on Michaels and Jericho, eliminating both via pinfall. This left Goldberg alone with and Triple H, who at the time had remained inside the chamber. Goldberg performed a spear on him through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber, in the process pushing him out of the chamber. Ric Flair, who was managing both Triple H and Orton, then handed [...] Triple H a sledgehammer. Goldberg attempted another spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg with the sledgehammer and covered him for the pinfall, thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Triple H, Orton and Flair viciously attacked Goldberg, ending with Triple H busting Goldberg open by repeatedly hitting him in the head with his sledgehammer.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{physical}} sciences, a phase is {{a region of}} space (a thermodynamic system), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform. Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air over the water is a third phase. <b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jar is another separate phase.

2500|$|Beuys's {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} {{in a private}} gallery opened on 26 November 1965 {{with one of the}} artist's most famous and compelling performances: How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare. The artist could be viewed through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gallery's window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear he mumbled muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings that lined the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described [...] "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," [...] though Beuys disagreed with the description.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{electronic}} transitions of an isolated ion {{are very well}} defined, broadening of the energy levels occurs when the ions are incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical fiber and thus the amplification window is also broadened. [...] This broadening is both homogeneous (all ions exhibit the same broadened spectrum) and inhomogeneous (different ions in different glass locations exhibit different spectra). Homogeneous broadening arises from the interactions with phonons of the glass, while inhomogeneous broadening is caused by differences in the glass sites where different ions are hosted. Different sites expose ions to different local electric fields, which shifts the energy levels via the Stark effect. In addition, the Stark effect also removes the degeneracy of energy states having the same total angular momentum (specified by the quantum number J). Thus, for example, the trivalent erbium ion (Er+3) has a ground state with J = 15/2, and {{in the presence of}} an electric field splits into J + 1/2 = 8 sublevels with slightly different energies. The first excited state has J = 13/2 and therefore a Stark manifold with 7 sublevels. Transitions from the J = 13/2 excited state to the J= 15/2 ground state are responsible for the gain at 1.5Âµm wavelength. The gain spectrum of the EDFA has several peaks that are smeared by the above broadening mechanisms. The net result is a very broad spectrum (30nm in silica, typically). The broad gain-bandwidth of fiber amplifiers make them particularly useful in ...|$|E
