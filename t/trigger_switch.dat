Triggering as a phenomenon in some examples of bilingual speech was first noticed and explored by Michael Clyne in the first of his many books, Transference and Triggering (1967), and has been subsequently problematised by many researchers m the field of language contact. A linguistic corpus based on taped interviews with 100 second-generation Croatian-English bilinguals provides the bilingual speech sample in which <b>triggered</b> <b>switching</b> is examined. While the relative number of instances of <b>triggered</b> <b>switching</b> is small, two categories of triggering are distinguished - consequential and anticipational, while two productive categories of trigger words are identified - proper nouns and English-origin lexical transfers (almost always nouns). The data suggest that items whose semantic-referential values are similar cross-linguistically are more likely to offer potential "cross-over points" leading to "unconscious" and "unimpeded" switching...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Underwater plasma {{acoustic}} source has many advantages and wide applications, but its properties are greatly {{affected by the}} <b>trigger</b> <b>switch.</b> In this paper, the working principles of two types spark gap switch (Fig. 1) were analyzed. Four aspects of the performance parameter including switching delay, delay jitter, voltage-drop percentage and transmission efficiency of the trigger switches (see Table 1) were researched by test and measurement. Experimental results show that: in normal condition, {{with the increase of}} charging voltage, switching delay time td and delay time jitter for both spark gap switches will decrease. Meanwhile, the switching delay and delay jitter of type A were always greater than type B; but, the transmission efficiency of type A was 20 % higher than type B.

Introduction* Underwater plasma technology, also called electro hydraulic effects [1], was proposed by Yutkin, a scholar of former Soviet Union, in 1955.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of energy safety has been a paramount subject matter. This we can see in todays electrical systems where protective devices such as fuse and circuit breakers are used to prevent fire hazards resulting from overload overvoltage and short circuits. However with all the revolution in technology these options may be considered less smart since the fuse made with wire strands calculated for specific current capacity faults permanently when the specified current rating is exceeded. While the circuit breaker which {{is made up of}} mechanical switch fails as a result of carbon forming and the wearing away of the contacts because of arcing. As a means of improvement this paper presents the design and development of an automatic single phase protective device using solid state relay SSR. This study is to ensure automatic cut off from power supply in cases of overvoltage above 240 V AC or when overload and short circuit current above 8 amps is detected without permanent damage of a fuse placed along current path. Also the design will ensure that there is an automatic close circuit whenever the <b>trigger</b> <b>switch</b> is momentary switch is closed. The system is achieved via the use of PIC micro-controller current sensor and other discrete components. The system is tested and works well inhibiting the frequent faulting of fuses. It also helps to prevent hazard as a result of overvoltage overload and short circuit and ensures a close circuit when the <b>trigger</b> <b>switch</b> is closed...|$|E

40|$|In general, {{demand feeding}} devices are {{equipped}} with a mechanical <b>trigger</b> <b>switch.</b> Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised demand feeding devices with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and automatic feeding devices (the automatic feeder (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other feeding devices, because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks.

40|$|Contemporary quality {{issues in}} product design are moving from materialistic to {{emotional}} user fulfillment; comprehensive {{research is needed}} to examine quality product feelings. This research is directed toward a deeper understanding of user and customer quality feelings for different product types, including services. The quality feelings concept includes dimensions of product quality, especially functionality, ergonomics and aesthetics. The first objective of this thesis is to identify, prioritize and synthesize quality feelings into product attributes in product development applications. The second objective is to explore, test and propose methodological approaches for designing quality feelings into products. Several methods from psychology, ergonomics, statistics and probabilistic methods and heuristics were applied to achieve the objectives. From a methodological viewpoint, Likert scales, free elicitation technique and Just About Right scales were applied for data collection. Multiple Regression, Factor Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, Genetic algorithms, Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Rough Sets (RS) were applied for data analyses. For ergonomic product evaluations, direct observations, 3 D workload simulations, time and frequency analyses were conducted. Five product applications are included in this thesis: operator driver cabin design of reach trucks, steering wheel design <b>trigger</b> <b>switch</b> design in right-angled nutrunners, bed-making systemsproducts and waiting room environments. Heuristic methods were found effective when there is a high number of product attributes that interact to provide quality feelings. RS results are consistent with PLS attribute predictions. When the number of product attributes is large in comparison to the number of observations, PLS extracts informative results for quality feelings. The RS method is effective in identifying interactions among design attributes. Quality feelings are associated with both tangible (tactile characteristics) and intangible (quick and easy to use) product characteristics. Words such as safety, functionality, ergonomics, comfort, reliability, supportiveness, usability, feedback, pleasantness, attractiveness, durability and distinctiveness describe quality feelings from tangible products and services. Based on product type, the quality dimensions represented by these words possess different interactions and dependencies. In work environments, products act as prostheses between workers for social interaction, which need to be considered as important quality feelings dimensions. QC 2011101...|$|E
40|$|The laser <b>trigger</b> <b>switch</b> (LTS) {{is a key}} {{component}} in ZR-type pulsed power systems. In ZR, the pulse rise time through the LTS is > 200 ns and additional stages of pulse compression are required to achieve the desired < 100 ns rise time. The inductance of the LTS ({approx} 500 nH) in large part determines the energy transfer time through the switch and {{there is much to}} be gained in improving system performance and reducing system costs by reducing this inductance. The current path through the cascade section of the ZR LTS is at a diameter of {approx} 6 -inches which is certainly not optimal from an inductance point of view. The LTS connects components of much greater diameter (typically 4 - 5 feet). In this LDRD the viability of switch concepts in which the diameter of cascade section is greatly increased have been investigated. The key technical question to be answered was, will the desired multi-channel behavior be maintained in a cascade section of larger diameter. This LDRD proceeded in 2 distinct phases. The original plan for the LDRD was to develop a promising switch concept and then design, build, and test a moderate scale switch which would demonstrate the key features of the concept. In phase I, a switch concept which meet all electrical design criteria and had a calculated inductance of 150 nH was developed. A 1. 5 MV test switch was designed and fabrication was initiated. The LDRD was then redirected due to budgetary concerns. The fabrication of the switch was halted and the focus of the LDRD was shifted to small scale experiments designed to answer the key technical question concerning multi-channel behavior. In phase II, the Multi-channel switch test bed (MCST) was designed and constructed. The purpose of MCST was to provide a versatile, fast turn around facility for the study the multi-channel electrical breakdown behavior of a ZR type cascade switch gap in a parameter space near that of a ZR LTS.
