40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} in patients of sexually transmitted infections {{with the aim}} of exploring STD and HIV prevention opportunities. METHODS: A behavioral survey was conducted on 56 soldiers while being treated or followed up for a sexually transmitted disease. They were studied for their attitude and sexual activity patterns relevant to the transmission of STDs. In addition, the individual&#x 2032;s outlook to sexual life and motivation factors was assessed. RESULTS: The study revealed that the source of infection of STD was equally divided between commercial sex worker (CSW) and casual sexual relationships. The majority did not use barrier contraceptives and knowledge about their protective role was insufficient. Access to health education was satisfactory; however, awareness levels for preventive action were still inadequate. Homosexuality was rare and most soldiers could stay without frequent sex. Alcohol was not found to be a significant co-factor. CONCLUSIONS: Heterosexual contact remains the main route of sexual contact. A wide variation in casual relationships and motivating factors was noted. Long abstinence and <b>transit</b> <b>periods,</b> traditionally considered major reasons for a soldier&#x 2032;s indulgence in sex did not seem to play a major role.

50|$|The culturagram {{has been}} seen as an {{essential}} tool in helping social workers work more effectively with families from many different cultures. Not only does it help the social worker achieve greater understanding of the culture of a family, it can also point the way toward future treatment. The culturagram can be useful in arriving at decisions about treatment planning and intervention. While using the culturagram the practitioner is required to look at the family in the here and now. Sometimes it is helpful, however, to construct the culturagram at different points of time, first at the beginning of intervention and then at a future point. In constructing the culturagram a retrospective approach is also useful. To truly understand immigrant families learning about an immigrant’s history is important. For example, the social worker can study what was the immigrants’ experience in their country of origin and in transit. Often a developmental approach that looks at three stages of immigration (pre-migration, transit, and current situation) is helpful in working with immigrants. (Drachman, 2004). For example, refugees may have had particularly traumatic experiences in their country of origin and undocumented immigrants through the <b>transit</b> <b>period</b> that may affect their current psychological well being in the United States. Current practice looks to evidence that specific interventions are effective. Students and practitioners have used the culturagram in their professional practice with families and reported that it is helpful in engaging families in a nonthreatening way. In the use of the culturagram culture is viewed through a multidimensional lens, rather than as a monolithic entity. Initial evaluation of the culturagram has been positive, and there are further plans to assess further its effectiveness in promoting culturally competent practice.|$|E

40|$|Presented is a {{numerical}} model for solving the nonlinear dynamics of Alfvén eigenmodes and energetic ions self-consistently. The model {{is an extension}} of a previous bump-on-tail model [1, 2], taking into account particle orbits and wave fields in realistic toroidal geometries. The model can be used in conjunction with an orbit averaged Monte Carlo code that handles heating and current drive (similar to e. g. the SELFO code), which enables modeling of the effects of MHD activity on plasma heating. For rapid particle tracing, the unperturbed guiding center orbits are described with canonical action-angle coordinates [3], and the perturbed Hamiltonian for wave-particle interaction is included as Fourier components in the same angles [4]. This allows the numerical integrator to take time steps over several <b>transit</b> <b>periods,</b> which efficiently resolves the relevant time scales for nonlinear wave-particle dynamics. The wave field is modeled by a static eigenfunction and a dynamic complex amplitude driven by the interactions with resonant and non-resonant particles. [1] E. Tholerus, T. Hellsten and T.

Flux balance calculation indicated that atmospheric deposition was the major source (97 % of total) of ^ Pb to the lake, and for ^ Po growth in-situ from the decay of ^ Pb contributed about 75 % of the total ^ Po supply to the lake. Most (about 90 %) of all the ^ Pb inputs to this lake was found to be incorporated into sediment.

In seeking the condition governing the time evolution of the tunnelling process, the Euler formula provided the crucial ingredient for time quantization, which discretised the continuous time in the oscillating barrier potential and energy harmonic equations.

When an electron entered the elastic channel, it was scattered, instantaneously, into finite neighbouring energy-level scattering channels, by absorption (emission) of photon energy from (to) the oscillating field, during the <b>transit</b> <b>period</b> across the dynamic barrier.

Using the Hipparcos database and the Hauck & Mermilliod (1998) compilation of Stromgren uvby photometry, we identify a sample of 206 metal-rich stars of spectral type K, G, and F which have an enhanced probability of harboring short-period planets. Many of these stars would be excellent candidates for addition to radial velocity surveys. We have searched the Hipparcos epoch photometry for transiting planets within our 206 star catalog.

First, we show that there is preliminary evidence for increasing metallicity with increasing stellar mass among known planet-bearing stars. This trend can be explained by a scenario in which planet-bearing stars accrete an average of 30 Earth Masses of rocky material after the gaseous protoplanetary disk phase has ended.

We report measurements of concurrent differences in surface wind speed, temperature, fluxes, and turbulence upwind and downwind of two turbine lines at the windward edge of a utility-scale wind farm. On {{the basis of these}} measurements, we offer a conceptual model based on physical mechanisms of how wind farms affect their own microclimate. Periods of documented curtailment and zero-power production of the wind farm offer useful opportunities to rigorously evaluate the microclimate impact of both stationary and operating turbines. During an 80 [*]min nighttime wind farm curtailment, we measured abrupt and large changes in turbulent fluxes of momentum and heat leeward of the turbines. At night, wind speed decreases in the near wake when turbines are off but abruptly increases when turbine operation is resumed. Our measurements are compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Terra and Aqua satellite measurements reporting wind farms to have higher nighttime surface temperatures. We demonstrate that turbine wakes modify surface fluxes continuously through the night, with similar magnitudes during the Terra and Aqua <b>transit</b> <b>periods.</b> Cooling occurs in the near wake and warming in the far wake when turbines are on, but cooling is negligible when turbines are off.

In this thesis, the oceanic influence on MJOs is studied with reanalysis products, numerical models, and idealized theoretical models. The energy sources for MJOs are calculated with NCEP reanalysis. The perturbed potential energy is found {{to be the most important}} energy source for most MJO events. In some MJO events, the sea surface is warmed due to the reduced latent heat flux during the suppressed phase of MJOs. As a result, warm sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) occur, which appear to prolong the life time of these MJO events. In a minority of the MJO events, warm SSTAs can drive the atmosphere actively and trigger MJO events. In these events, the warm SSTAs are attributable to the internal oceanic processes influenced by the warm Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), which spreads from the southeastern Indian Ocean to the western Indian Ocean and modifies the subtle balance between stratification and mixing in the western Indian Ocean.

The transits were discovered using photometric data from the Kelper public data release. The LHS 6343 stellar system was previously identified as a single high-proper-motion M dwarf. We use high-contrast imaging to resolve the system into two low-mass stars with masses 0. 45 Msun and 0. 36 Msun, respectively, and a projected separation of 55 arcsec. High-resolution spectroscopy shows that the more massive component undergoes Doppler variations consistent with Keplerian motion, with a period equal to the <b>transit</b> <b>period</b> and an amplitude consistent with a companion mass of M_C = 62. 8 +/- 2. 3 Mjup.
