40|$|We extend Philippe Aghion and Patrick Bolton's (1987) classic {{model to}} analyze the {{equilibrium}} incidence and impact of exclusive contracts in a setting where research and development (R&D) drives industry performance. An exclusive contract between an incumbent supplier and a buyer arises when patent protection and/or <b>the</b> <b>incumbent's</b> R&D ability are sufficiently pronounced. The exclusive contract generally reduces the entrant's R&D, and can reduce <b>the</b> <b>incumbent's</b> R&D. Exclusive contracts reduce welfare if <b>the</b> <b>incumbent's</b> R&D ability is sufficiently limited, but can increase welfare if patent protection and <b>the</b> <b>incumbent's</b> R&D ability are sufficiently pronounced.
