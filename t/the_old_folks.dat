500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>folks</b> have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>folks</b> hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E
500|$|Moondance was {{released}} by Warner Bros. on 27 January 1970 in the United Kingdom and on 28 February 1970 in the United States, receiving immediate acclaim from critics. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau claimed that Morrison had finally fulfilled his artistic potential: [...] "Forget Astral Weeks—this is a brilliant, catchy, poetic, and completely successful LP." [...] Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in Rolling Stone, hailing it {{as a work of}} [...] "musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of 'Into the Mystic' and the fine, epic brilliance of 'Caravan' will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years." [...] Fellow Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau found the singer's vocals overwhelming: [...] "Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it." [...] Ralph J. Gleason from the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote of Morrison's singing as a focal point of praise: [...] "He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>folks</b> in every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theresa McDermott has chased her “ideal” {{life as an}} urban-dwelling, punk(ish) singer-songwriter to {{the very}} end of its {{possible}} existence. [...] She is broke, options have run out and she happens to have a few kids she is raising on her own since their dad split a year ago. [...] Facing eviction and nowhere to go, Theresa packs up her children and what is left of her life and moves back to the small rural town, childhood home and parents she deliberately ran from a decade ago. [...] Her parents’ mutual misery and depressingly gloomy lives were a “downer” she felt had no place in her fun city life. [...] Yet from the moment Theresa drives back up her old driveway, it is clear that there have been some major changes. Her parents, armed with a plethora of hobbies, a hot tub and a new philosophy, are not exactly <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>folks</b> she left behind. [...] Theresa needs a job, her parents need their space and a painful family history needs some closure. [...] Old wounds, unattainable dreams, and some “other things” are exposed as a fractured family works to become whole and a woman with a few kids learns to become a mother.|$|E
