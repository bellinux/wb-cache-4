5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
50|$|In the adaptationist view of evolution, <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> is a {{function}} of both <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> and environment, while the environment is only {{a function}} of itself. The environment is seen as autonomous and unshaped by <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> Lewontin instead believed in a constructivist view, in which <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> {{is a function}} of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> and environment, with the environment being a function of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> and environment as well. This means that <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> shapes <b>the</b> environment as the environment shapes <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> <b>The</b> <b>organism</b> shapes <b>the</b> environment for future generations.|$|R

5000|$|... == Metabolism == D. donghaensis {{performs}} light-driven {{sodium ion}} transport. This light-driven proton pump {{is called a}} proteorhodopsin, which increases <b>the</b> <b>organism’s</b> survival rate because it can convert light into energy that <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> needs to grow. Since <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> uses light for energy, it is a phototroph. D. donghaensis is able to secrete enzymes such as catalase and oxidase. Since <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> is a strict aerobe, it used oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. <b>The</b> <b>organism</b> can grow on peptone and tryptone as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. D. donghaensis cannot grow {{in the absence of}} NaCl or when it is greater than 7% (w/v); growth is optimal at 2% (w/v) NaCl. <b>The</b> <b>organism</b> is susceptible to the antibiotics tetracycline and carbenicillin, although <b>the</b> <b>organism's</b> ability to form biofilms makes it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the viscous layers.|$|R
5|$|Essential genes include Housekeeping genes (critical {{for basic}} cell functions) {{as well as}} genes that are {{expressed}} at different times in <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> development or life cycle. Housekeeping genes are used as experimental controls when analysing gene expression, since they are constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, the use of <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are {{a vital part of}} sewage treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
50|$|In addition, to {{show that}} a {{microorganism}} causes the disorder, the Koch postulates would require one show that <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> is present in all cases of the disorder, that <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> can be extracted from those with the disorder and be cultured, that transferring <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> into healthy subjects causes the disorder, and <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> can be reisolated from the infected party. Giovanonni notes that the Koch postulates cannot be used in the case of postinfection disorders (such as PANDAS and SC) because <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> may no longer be present when symptoms emerge, multiple <b>organisms</b> may cause <b>the</b> symptoms, and the symptoms may be a rare reaction to a common pathogen.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>organisms</b> {{responsible}} for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs. Nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun. Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via {{a process known as}} photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as ATP, whose bonds can be broken to release energy. A few ecosystems, however, depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane, sulfides, or other non-luminal energy sources.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>organisms</b> which parasitize fungi {{are known}} as mycoparasitic organisms. Certain species of the Pythium genus, which are oomycetes, have {{potential}} as biocontrol agents against certain fungi. Fungi can also act as mycoparasites or antagonists of other fungi, such as Hypomyces chrysospermus, which grows on bolete mushrooms.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} biopotential of an organism includes electroporating {{a portion of}} a tissue surface of <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> <b>The</b> biopotential of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> is then measured with electrodes at the electroporated portion of <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> <b>The</b> portion of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> that is electroporated can be, for example, a skin surface of <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> A resistance-decreasing agent, such as heparin, sodium thiosulfate, thioglycolic acid solution and dithioglycolic acid {{can be applied to the}} tissue surface to facilitate reduction in electrical resistance. Another example of a resistance-decreasing agent is a keratin-disrupting agent, such as sulforhodamine. Examples of suitable biopotential measurements include electrocardiographic, electroencephalographic, electromyographic, electrohysterographic and elctrokymographic measurements. The method decreases skin resistance to diminish unwanted electrical voltages that compete with biopotential measurements, thereby significantly improving the biopotent...|$|R

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{were split}} {{off as a}} third domain {{because of the large}} {{differences}} in their ribosomal RNA structure. The particular RNA molecule sequenced, known as 16s rRNA, is present in all organisms and always has the same vital function, the production of proteins. Because this function is so central to life, organisms with mutations of their 16s rRNA are unlikely to survive, leading to great stability in the structure of this nucleotide over many generations. 16s rRNA is also large enough to retain organism-specific information, but small enough to be sequenced in a manageable amount of time. In 1977, Carl Woese, a microbiologist studying the genetic sequencing of organisms, developed a new sequencing method that involved splitting the RNA into fragments that could be sorted and compared to other fragments from other organisms. The more similar the patterns between species were, the more closely related <b>the</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark often become {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Greg Retallack's {{hypothesis}} that Ediacaran organisms were lichens is not widely {{accepted by the}} scientific community. He argues that the fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish, and their relief is closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as compressed cylinders. He points out the chitinous walls of lichen colonies would provide a similar resistance to compaction, and claims the large size of <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> (up to 1.5 metres long, far larger {{than any of the}} preserved burrows) also hints against classification with animals. Finally, Ediacaran fossils from classic localities of the Flinders Ranges have been found in growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols, interpreted as soils of well-drained temperate desert soils. Such habitats limit interpretive options for fractal Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia to lichenised or unlichenised fungi, but other Ediacaran fossils could have been slime moulds or microbial colonies.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. <b>The</b> <b>organisms</b> involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} field around swimming plankton {{depends on}} the swimming style and speed of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> and <b>the</b> processes affecting uptake or exudation of chemicals by <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> Here we present a simple model for the flow field around a neutrally buoyant self-propelled organism at low Reynolds number, and numerically calculate the chemical field around <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> We show how the concentration field close to <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> and <b>the</b> mass transfer rates vary with swimming speed and style for Dirichlet (diffusion limited transport) boundary conditions. We calculate how {{the length of the}} chemical wake, defined as being the distance at which the chemical field drops to 10 % of the surface concentration of <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> when stationary, varies with swimming speed and style for both Dirichlet and Neumann (production limited) boundary conditions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the length of the chemical wake increases with increasing swimming speed, and <b>the</b> self-propelled <b>organism</b> displays a significantly longer wake than the towed-body model. For the Neumann boundary conditions the converse is true; because swimming enhances the transport of the chemical away from <b>the</b> <b>organism,</b> <b>the</b> surface concentration of chemical is reduced and thus the wake length is reduced...|$|R
50|$|Variational {{properties}} {{also include}} the production of DNA sequence variation, epigenetic variation, and phenotypic variation.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between genes {{can be measured}} by comparing the sequence alignment of their DNA. The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called conserved sequence. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes {{can be used for}} phylogenetic analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> they come from are related.|$|E

50|$|Schultz has pioneered {{a method}} for adding new {{building}} blocks, beyond the common twenty amino acids, to the genetic codes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.
