5|$|As a youth, Ezeh {{was unable}} to play {{football}} {{because he was too}} big for the local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, even though he was not the primary weapon in <b>the</b> <b>backfield.</b> Ezeh was {{also a member of the}} Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships.|$|E
5|$|The Edmonton Eskimos {{selected}} Aidoo in {{the second}} round of the 2003 CFL Draft. He went on to play for four CFL teams, spending the most time with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. With the Tiger-Cats, Aidoo primarily played on special teams. He also occasionally started at fullback and served as a back-up for other players in <b>the</b> <b>backfield.</b> He retired from the CFL after playing in 60 regular season games and recording 20 special team tackles.|$|E
5|$|The 49ers' Million Dollar Backfield is {{regarded}} as one of the best backfields in NFL history, and is the only full-house backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. By virtue of their memberships in the pro hall of fame, all four were automatically inducted as charter members of the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Longtime 49ers coach Bill Walsh co-authored a book about <b>the</b> <b>backfield</b> in 2000 entitled The Million Dollar Backfield: The San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s. In 2014, a sculpture comprising the four players, crouched over as if in a huddle, was erected in Levi's Stadium.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Million Dollar <b>Backfield</b> was a National Football League (NFL) {{offensive}} <b>backfield</b> of <b>the</b> Chicago Cardinals in 1947 {{after an}} unprecedented {{amount of money}} by Cardinals owner Charles Bidwill lured several of the day's top players to the team. <b>The</b> Million Dollar <b>backfield</b> was also referred to separately as <b>the</b> Dream <b>Backfield</b> by Bidwill.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} rules which differ for play in <b>the</b> {{offensive}} <b>backfield</b> {{as opposed to}} play {{in front of the}} line of scrimmage. The 1906 football rule reforms mandated that the offensive team line up with at least seven players on the line of scrimmage, which are now commonly called [...] "lineman". Therefore, a maximum of four players are allowed in <b>the</b> offensive <b>backfield.</b> <b>The</b> other players not on the line of scrimmage may be positioned anywhere, but all must be at least 1 yard behind the seven or more players on the line of scrimmage. A forward pass can only be legally made from <b>the</b> offensive <b>backfield.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Saints {{received}} Campbell {{in exchange}} for their first round draft pick in 1985, with which Houston selected cornerback Richard Johnson. The trade came as a surprise in New Orleans; the team already had the young George Rogers, the 1981 No. 1 overall draft pick and that year's Rookie of the Year and rushing champion. With Campbell and Rogers, the Saints now had two Heisman Trophy winners in <b>the</b> <b>backfield.</b> In his first game with New Orleans, Campbell carried five times for 19 yards, and continued to have a diminished role in the offense {{throughout the rest of the}} season. He rushed for a total of 468 yards and four touchdowns in 1984, and failed to record a 100-yard game during the season.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>backfield</b> of Albert Hill, Everett Strupper, Joe Guyon, and Judy Harlan led the Golden Tornado, and {{all four}} rushed {{for more than}} 100 yards in a 48–0 victory over Tulane. During the regular season Georgia Tech {{defeated}} strong opponents by large margins, and its 41–0 victory over eastern Penn shocked many; Davidson, with Buck Flowers (a future Tech star), was defeated 32–10. Tech's 83–0 victory over Vanderbilt is the worst loss in Vanderbilt history, and its 63–0 defeat of Washington & Lee was the worst loss in W history at the time. Tech finished the season by defeating Auburn 68–7, clinching the conference title. Davidson and Auburn were the only teams to score points against Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in <b>the</b> <b>backfield</b> or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{offensive}} <b>backfield</b> is <b>the</b> area of an American {{football field}} behind {{the line of}} scrimmage. <b>The</b> offensive <b>backfield</b> can also refer to members of offense who begin plays behind the line, typically including any backs on the field, such as the quarterback, halfbacks and fullback.|$|R
50|$|In {{four games}} in the 2010 preseason, the NFL experimented with an eighth official, a deep judge, in <b>the</b> {{defensive}} <b>backfield</b> opposite <b>the</b> back judge. The primary responsibility for this new position is the action of receivers, and it allowed the NFL to adjust coverage after the umpire was moved to <b>the</b> offensive <b>backfield.</b> <b>The</b> experiment was continued for 12 {{games in the}} 2011 preseason. The league has yet to implement such a system for the regular season or the playoffs.|$|R
5000|$|After his {{retirement}} in 1980, Houston served as a head football coach for Wheatley High School and Westbury High School in Houston, Texas.

5|$|Youngblood {{was honored}} as the NFC Defensive Player of the Year by United Press International in 1975 and Pro Football Weekly named Youngblood the NFL {{defensive}} lineman of the year. For {{the third consecutive}} season Youngblood led the Rams in sacks (15) and was a consensus All-pro again, repeating his 1974 honor. In a December, 1975, 35-23 playoff win over the St. Louis Cardinals, Youngblood pass-rushed Cardinals offensive lineman Dan Dierdorf, penetrated into <b>the</b> <b>backfield,</b> then tipped and intercepted a pass by Jim Hart, returning the interception 47 yards for a touchdown. Later in the game, Youngblood forced a fumble that was recovered by teammate Fred Dryer, blocked an extra point attempt, and sacked Hart to stop a Cardinals drive.|$|E
5|$|With the 49ers in the AAFC, Perry led {{the league}} in rushing {{touchdown}}s in both 1948 in 1949, and also in rushing yards in 1949. He had the first and only kick return touchdown of his career in 1948 when he returned a kickoff 87 yards against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Following the season, Perry was invited to play in the 1949 AAFC All-Star game against the league champion Cleveland Browns. The AAFC folded soon after and the 49ers were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. Perry finished fifth among league rushing leaders in both 1950 and 1951. The 49ers acquired halfback Hugh McElhenny in the 1952 Draft, who joined Perry in <b>the</b> <b>backfield</b> to form a prolific rushing duo. He and McElhenny finished third and fourth in the league respectively in rushing yards that season. Following the season, Perry was invited to play in his first Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Kindt joined a backfield which {{contained}} quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee, the primary starter at halfback. That season Kindt rushed for 266 {{yards and two}} touchdowns on 61 carries. One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49–7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in <b>the</b> <b>backfield.</b> A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28–0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 carries, an average of 2.9 yards per carry during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|Chicago scored first after Cutler's 32-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Brandon Marshall capped a 65-yard drive that took just 2:23. However, the Lions would travel 85 yards to tie on Matthew Stafford's 5-yard pass to Kris Durham. In the following quarter, the Bears reached the Lions' 4-yard line, but Cutler's pass was tipped by Ndamukong Suh, and intercepted by DeAndre Levy in the endzone; both teams would fail to score in the quarter. During the quarter, Cutler began showing signs of struggling due to an ankle injury. In the third quarter, the Lions would score on Stafford's four-yard touchdown to Johnson. Afterwards, the Bears were forced {{to settle for a}} 25-yard field goal, narrowing the gap to one point. In the fourth, Stafford was intercepted by Chris Conte, who reached Detroit's 9-yard line, and Cutler would then throw a 14-yard {{touchdown pass}} to Alshon Jeffery, which was eventually nullified. After an incomplete pass, Gould kicked a 32-yard field goal to draw the score to 14–13. However, Johnson would catch a 14-yard pass from Stafford to increase the lead to 21–13, and with 2:22 remaining, Josh McCown entered the game in favor of Cutler, and guided the Bears' offense 74 yards, culminating in McCown's 11-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Marshall with 40 seconds to go. On the two-point conversion, McCown's pass to tight end Dante Rosario fell incomplete, but Willie Young was penalized for roughing the passer, allowing the Bears a second chance, which failed after Matt Forté was tackled by Nick Fairley in <b>the</b> <b>backfield.</b> The Bears' onside kick would backfire, as Joique Bell recovered, sealing a season sweep for the Lions.|$|E
5|$|The {{animosity}} between Taylor and the Giants {{carried over}} into the 1963 preseason, as {{the second quarter of}} an exhibition game between Green Bay and New York began with Taylor drawing a personal foul penalty for roughing up Giants defensive end Andy Robustelli. Taylor had a slow start to the 1963 season as he recovered from numerous injuries and his bout of hepatitis, but still managed another 1,000-yard season. He again eclipsed 1,000yards in 1964, becoming the first player to record five straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also began to see more use as a receiver out of <b>the</b> <b>backfield</b> during his later career. His specialty in the passing game was catching short swing passes from quarterback Bart Starr. His most productive season as a receiver was 1964, as he caught 38 passes for a career-high 354yards and three touchdowns. That season also included an 84-yard touchdown run in a win over the Detroit Lions, the longest run of his career and the longest of any player in the NFL that year. He made his final Pro Bowl appearance after the 1964 season and the last in a string of five straight. Despite the productivity from Taylor, the Packers missed the postseason in 1963 and 1964. They returned to the postseason in 1965, where Taylor carried 50 times for 156yards over two games. He gained 96 of those yards during the Packers' 23–12 win over the Browns in the 1965 NFL Championship Game, second to Hornung's 105. Taylor was named the game's most outstanding player by SPORT magazine and received a Chevrolet Corvette.|$|E

25|$|The Jets {{lined up}} in an I formation, with Sanchez under center. In <b>the</b> <b>backfield</b> were fullback Lex Hilliard and running back Shonn Greene, 4.5 and 7 yards behind the line of {{scrimmage}} respectively. Sanchez had called the play in the huddle: a designed handoff to the fullback. Typically in this formation, the running back receives the ball, and the fullback blocks for him. The play call would attempt to misdirect the defense, as Greene would peel away to the left and Hilliard would take a quick handoff to the right.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the main}} {{strength}} on the Cowboys offense was their running game. Rookie running back Duane Thomas rushed 151 times for 803 yards (a 5.1 {{yards per carry}} average) and 5 touchdowns, while adding another 416 yards returning kickoffs. Fullback Walt Garrison, who replaced the injured Hill, provided Thomas with excellent blocking and rushed for 507 yards and 3 touchdowns himself. Garrison was also a good receiver out of <b>the</b> <b>backfield,</b> catching 21 passes for 205 yards and 2 touchdowns. Up front, Pro Bowl guard John Niland and Rayfield Wright anchored the offensive line.|$|E
