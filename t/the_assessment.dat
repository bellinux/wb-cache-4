40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to examine the relationships between sensory assessments of air quality made using different methods: odor intensity by category scale, category-ratio scale and equal-intensity matching with acetone as a reference and acceptability scale, and to study whether <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> of acceptability {{can be explained by}} selected characteristics of the air. A sensory panel assessed the air polluted by emissions from different building materials at different area-specific ventilation rates. <b>The</b> three <b>assessments</b> of odor intensity were linearly strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, for practical applications it seems feasible to apply only one of the investigated methods. Odor intensity was strongly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> of acceptability of the air. This suggests that, for the investigated materials, <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> of acceptability are mainly influenced by odor intensity. The selected descriptors characterizing the air could not explain <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> of acceptability because the odor intensity levels were generally low...|$|R

The properties of <b>the</b> visual <b>assessment</b> in each country for staining and change in colour were obtained.
