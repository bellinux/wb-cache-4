5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> wall.|$|E
5|$|The skull, {{which is}} short at the front, shows some typical oryzomyine characters. The palate is long, {{extending}} past the molars and the maxillary bones. The alisphenoid strut, {{which in some}} sigmodontines separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, is absent. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process contacting the tegmen tympani, the roof the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity.</b> The front part is short.|$|E
40|$|Conclusions. The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} the Hh specimen conformed {{to those of other}} Pleistocene human fossils, indicating strong cranial structures and a heavy mandible. The mastoid was large and suggested a powerful sternocleidomastoid muscle. The inner ear and <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavities</b> were similar in size and orientation, suggesting that their functions were probably similar. Our observations suggest that the left ear of this Hh specimen was healthy. The large canaliculo /fenestral angle confirms that this ancestor was bipedal. It also strongly suggests that Hh individuals were predisposed to develop certain pathologies of the labyrinth capsule associated with bipedalism, in particular otosclerosis. Objective. We studied a temporal bone of Homo heidelbergensis (Hh) in order to investigate the clinical and physiological implications of certain morphological features, especially those associated with the evolutionary reorganization of the inner ear. Material and methods. The bone, found in a breach of a cave near Málaga in southern Spain, together with Middle /Upper Pleistocene faunal remains, is / 300 000 years old. Four analytical methods were employed. A 3 D highresolution surface laser scan was used for anatomical measurements. For the sectional analysis of the middle and inner ears of Hh we used high-resolution CT, simultaneously studying a normal temporal bone from Homo sapiens sapiens (Hss). To study the middle and inner ear spaces we used 3 D reconstruction CT preceded by an intra-bone air shielding technique. To examine the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavities</b> and measure the canaliculo /fenestral angle, we used a special minimally invasive endoscopi...|$|R
5000|$|The roof of {{the cavity}} (also called the tegmental wall, tegmental roof or tegmentum tympani) is formed by a thin plate of bone, the tegmen tympani, which {{separates}} the cranial and <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavities.</b> It is situated on the anterior (frontal) surface of the petrous portion {{of the temporal bone}} close to its angle of junction with the squama temporalis; it is prolonged backward so as to roof in the tympanic antrum, and forward to cover in the semicanal for the tensor tympani muscle. Its lateral edge corresponds with the remains of the petrosquamous suture. The Atticus is the part of the tegmentum tympani where the stapes and incus are attached.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore a {{feasible}} method for the reconstruction of the nasal and temporal bone structures of the Chinese virtual human project and provide a more accurate and facilitated way view them three-dimensionally (3 D). The 3 -D Slicer software was used to reconstruct the anatomic structures of the human nose and temporal bone. Segmentation and extraction of the contours of the ROI (region of interest) in each single slice were conducted and the processed volume data was transferred into the 3 -D Slicer. After resegmentation, a set of labeled maps of the ROI were produced. Based on these maps, the 3 D surface models of the tissues of interest were constructed. Four groups of paranasal sinuses, nasal septa, middle and inferior turbinates, temporal bones, <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavities,</b> mastoid air cells, sigmoid sinuses, and internal carotid arteries were reconstructed successfully. These models show spatial relationships and orientation between them. The results show that the 3 -D Slicer may be used for the 3 D visualization of parts of anatomic structures in the nose and temporal bone based on the first Chinese virtual human data, and thus, can facilitate the observation and understanding of the anatomic structures in thi...|$|R
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} of the skull distinguish the two genera. The tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone {{at the back of the}} skull, are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The zygomatic plate, a plate at the sides of the skull that roots the front part of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced zygomatic notch.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
50|$|The fragmentary {{occipital}} area of {{the skull}} (the base of the skull) shows part of the boundary of the foramen magnum (through which the spinal cord enters the skull), channels for the vestibular system (part of the inner ear responsible for balance), and holes for the semicircular canal (also part of the vestibular system). These holes and channels are found on the supraoccipital bone. The exoccipitals and opisthotics are also known in Tarjadia, and form the paraoccipital processes, two projections for the attachments of muscles that open the lower jaw. These processes form notches that may be <b>tympanic</b> fossae, <b>cavities</b> of the middle ear.|$|R
40|$|The ear connects {{people to}} the outside world and {{contributes}} to sense of balance. However, a number of disorders can interrupt this perfect state, resulting in hearing impairment. Middle ear pathology, like myringosclerosis or otosclerosis is frequently seen and its early treatment is crucial to prevent others worst situations. The myringosclerosis is a formation of dense connective tissue in the eardrum, not usually associated with hearing loss. Otosclerosis is an abnormal growth of bone near the stapes and can result in conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss [4]. In this work, a 3 D solid model of tympano ossicular chain was built [2] with the integration of an improved membrane model [1], based on the finite element method, using the ABAQUS software. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) were considered isotropic and the eardrum orthotropic. The material properties were obtained by literature [5]. The ligaments that connect the ossicles to the <b>cavity</b> <b>tympanic</b> walls have a hyperelastic behavior being a Yeoh model applied. The strain-energy function, for the Yeoh model can be written as [3]...|$|R
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but {{have been reported in}} some populations. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> a defining character of oryzomyines. There are some {{openings in}} the mastoid bone.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities, which are set far to the front. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> a defining character of oryzomyines. Some openings occur in the mastoid bone.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the front part of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The zygomatic plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The diastema (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The bony palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except {{for a pair of}} foramina (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of the palate is {{at the level of the}} middle of the third molars (M3). In the bony roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{front part}} of the skull is notably broad. As in Holochilus, the {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front portion of the cheek bone, is expansive and produced into a spinous process at the anterior margin. The jugal bone is small, but less reduced than in Holochilus. The interorbital region of the skull is narrow and flanked by high beads. The incisive foramina, which perforate the palate between the incisors and the upper molars, are long, extending between the molars. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the posterior margin of the maxillary bones, and it is perforated near the third molars by conspicuous posterolateral palatal pits. As in all oryzomyines, the squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> but Lundomys is unusual in that the squamosal and the tegmen tympani usually overlap when viewed from the side. In the mandible, the angular and coronoid processes are less well-developed than in Holochilus. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, near the coronoid process, is small. The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their anterior edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short {{and do not}} reach near the first molars; they are longer in T.hylophilus. They are widest where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple posterolateral palatal pits {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid strut separates two foramina (openings) at the base of the skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of T.ucucha follows the primitive pattern. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> overlaps the suspensory process of the squamosal bone. At the back of the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process to receive the root of the lower incisor, which is absent in T.hylophilus.|$|E
25|$|The sinus {{receives}} some cerebellar and inferior cerebral veins, and veins {{from the}} <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The tensor tympani is {{the larger}} of the two muscles of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> the other being the stapedius.|$|E
25|$|The tensor tympani {{arises from}} the {{cartilaginous}} portion of the auditory tube, and the adjoining {{part of the great}} wing of the sphenoid, {{as well as from the}} osseous canal in which it is contained. Passing backward through the canal, it ends in a slender tendon which enters the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> makes a sharp bend around the extremity of the septum, known as the processus cochleariformis, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus, near its root.|$|E
500|$|The ear is {{the organ}} of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually {{described}} as having three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word [...] "ear" [...] often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically {{on either side of}} the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.|$|E
500|$|The incisive {{foramina}} {{are very}} long, extending well between the molars. The posterolateral palatal pits are well-developed and recessed into a [...] (depression). The bony palate is relatively short, with the mesopterygoid fossa extending {{forward to the}} end of the molar row or even between the third molars. The roof of the fossa is perforated by large sphenopalatine vacuities. Usually, an alisphenoid strut is present; this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The condition of various grooves and foramina of the skull indicates that the pattern of the arterial circulation of the head is derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is large and the mastoid bone is perforated by a fenestra (opening). The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
500|$|The incisive foramina, {{perforations}} of {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short, not extending between the molars. The {{condition of the}} posterolateral palatal pits is variable, with some individuals having small pits and others having larger pits that may be recessed into a [...] (depression). The palate is moderately long, extending beyond the molars but not beyond the posterior margins of the maxillary bone. In most specimens, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back of the palate, is not perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities and thus it is fully ossified; if present, these vacuities are small. Mindomys lacks an alisphenoid strut; in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two openings (foramina) in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. There are no openings in the mastoid bone. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
500|$|The rostrum (front {{part of the}} skull) is short. The broad {{zygomatic}} plate {{develops a}} prominent notch, but not a spine, on its front end, and its back margin {{is in front of}} the first molars. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest towards the front and is flanked by beadings along its margins. The interparietal bone is relatively long. The incisive foramina, perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars, are narrow and long and taper towards the end. The palate itself is also long, extending beyond the molars, and includes prominent posterolateral palatal pits near the third molars, which are excavated into deep [...] The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is not perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. O.gorgasi lacks an alisphenoid strut; in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity,</b> a defining character of oryzomyines.

6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and external auditory meatus (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the <b>tympanic</b> <b>cavity</b> and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E
