25|$|Photo {{manipulation}} software sometimes {{fails to}} update the embedded <b>thumbnail</b> after an editing operation, possibly causing the user to inadvertently publish compromising information. For example, someone might blank out a licence registration plate of a car (for privacy concerns), {{only to have the}} <b>thumbnail</b> not so updated, meaning the information is still visible.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique for creating novel, enhanced <b>thumbnails</b> of Web pages. These <b>thumbnails</b> combine {{the advantages of}} plain <b>thumbnails</b> and text summaries to provide consistent performance {{on a variety of}} tasks. We conducted a study in which participants used three different types of summaries (enhanced <b>thumbnails,</b> plain <b>thumbnails,</b> and text summaries) to search Web pages to find several different types of information. Participants took an average of 67, 86, and 95 seconds to find the answer with enhanced <b>thumbnails,</b> plain <b>thumbnails,</b> and text summaries, respectively. As expected, there was a strong effect of question category. For some questions, text summaries outperformed plain <b>thumbnails,</b> while for other questions, plain <b>thumbnails</b> outperformed text summaries. Enhanced <b>thumbnails</b> (which combine the features of text summaries and plain <b>thumbnails)</b> had more consistent performance than either text summaries or plain <b>thumbnails,</b> having for all categories the best performance or performance that was statistically indistinguishable from the best...|$|R

30|$|The {{results of}} {{each set of}} query images are {{presented}} in Tables  1, 2, 3 and 4. There are 100 matching runs presented in each table. The first two tables present the matching distances between the <b>thumbnails</b> (query images) and the visually protected images, and the last two present the matching distances between the <b>thumbnails</b> (query images) and the DC images generated from the visually protected images. Simulations using a dataset of 100 images with four different sizes of query images resulted in 40, 000 matching attempts between the <b>thumbnails</b> and the visually protected images, and 40, 000 matching attempts between the <b>thumbnails</b> and the DC images.|$|R

25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the <b>thumbnail</b> of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the <b>thumbnail</b> is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E
25|$|During {{a project}} to make ISPL more {{specific}} for generic product software implementations, a number of scenario’s were made. One of these was for an approach of a one-shot implementation.

40|$|Data carving is {{generally}} used to recover deleted images in digital investigations, but carving {{time can be}} significant and the deleted images may have been overwritten. Thus, <b>thumbnails</b> of (deleted) images are an alternative evidence,and can often be found within databases created by either operating systems or image viewers. Existing literature generally focus on the extraction of <b>thumbnails</b> from databases created by the operating system. Understanding <b>thumbnails</b> created by image reviewers is relatively understudied. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new approach of automating extraction of <b>thumbnails</b> produced by image viewers. We then evaluate the utility of our approach using popular image viewers...|$|R

25|$|A {{vertical}} toolbar {{known as}} the charms (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button. The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has {{been converted into a}} hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying a <b>thumbnail</b> of the Start screen. Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a <b>thumbnail</b> list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 {{is similar to that of}} Windows 7.|$|E

The <b>thumbnails</b> would guide people to Kelly's work rather than away from it {{and the size of the}} <b>thumbnails</b> makes using them instead of the original unattractive.|$|R

30|$|We have {{presented}} {{a conceptual framework}} for secure online image trading in a cloud environment. The traded images were visually protected in the DCT domain, and stored on an untrusted server. <b>Thumbnails</b> of original images were publicly accessible through the website and served as queries. Image matching between the <b>thumbnails</b> and protected images was achieved by comparing the moment invariants of the <b>thumbnails</b> and of the DC-image generated from the protected images. The proposed moment distance enabled the target images to be differentiated from other protected images in the database.|$|R
25|$|Ikaite is {{the mineral}} {{name for the}} hexahydrate of calcium carbonate, CaCO3·6H2O. Ikaite tends to form very steep or spiky {{pyramidal}} crystals, often radially arranged, of varied sizes from <b>thumbnail</b> size aggregates to gigantic salient spurs. It is only found in a metastable state, and decomposes rapidly by losing most of its water content once removed from near-freezing water. This 'melting mineral' is more commonly known through its pseudomorphs.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{in natural}} {{seawater}} values are between 1250mg/L and 1350mg/L. (approximately 3.7% {{of the total}} seawater mineral content. See <b>thumbnail</b> chart.) Dead Sea minerals contain a significantly higher magnesium chloride ratio (50.8%). Carbonates and calcium are essential for all growth of corals, coralline algae, clams, and invertebrates. Magnesium can be depleted by mangrove plants {{and the use of}} excessive limewater or by going beyond natural calcium, alkalinity, and pH values.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} shown to the right in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the {{sampling}} theorem's condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process that creates the <b>thumbnail</b> shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a low-pass filter first and then downsamples the image {{to result in a}} smaller image that does not exhibit the moiré pattern. The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{browsing}} {{of image}} collections use mechanisms such as <b>thumbnails</b> arranged {{on a regular}} grid or on a line, often mounted over a scrollable panel. However, this approach does not scale well {{with the size of}} the datasets (number of images). In this paper, we propose a new thumbnail-based interface to browse large collections of images. Our approach is based on weighted centroidal anisotropic Voronoi diagrams. A dynamically changing subset of images is represented by <b>thumbnails</b> and shown on the screen. <b>Thumbnails</b> are shaped like general polygons, to better cover screen space, while still reflecting the original aspect ratios or orientation of the represented images. During the browsing process, <b>thumbnails</b> are dynamically rearranged, reshaped and rescaled. The objective is to devote more screen space (more numerous and larger <b>thumbnails)</b> to the parts of the dataset closer to the current region of interest, and progressively lesser away from it, while still making the dataset visible as a whole. During the entire process, temporal coherence is always maintained. GPU implementation easily guarantees the frame rates needed for fully smooth interactivity...|$|R

25|$|In the Susiya synagogue, {{the hand}} of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once {{illustrated}} a biblical scene such as Moses Receiving the Law or the Binding of Isaac. Though the hand was subjected to intense iconoclastic hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact. A <b>thumbnail</b> has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that {{the hand of}} God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and fingers as a Torah scroll.|$|E
25|$|For all Windows Vista Premium Ready PCs, {{when using}} Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, {{a preview of}} each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a {{cascading}} stack of their open windows using the mouse scroll wheel, much like Apple's Cover Flow. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views {{of all of them}} simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are +, which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, ++, which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and ++ to flip through open windows backwards). The window buttons on the taskbar show a <b>thumbnail</b> image of the window, when the mouse hovers over the button.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} URLs crawled being generated by server-side software has also {{made it difficult for}} web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content. Endless combinations of HTTP GET (URL-based) parameters exist, of which only a small selection will actually return unique content. For example, a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users, as specified through HTTP GET parameters in the URL. If there exist four ways to sort images, three choices of <b>thumbnail</b> size, two file formats, and an option to disable user-provided content, then the same set of content can be accessed with 48 different URLs, all of which may be linked on the site. This mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers, as they must sort through endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content.|$|E
