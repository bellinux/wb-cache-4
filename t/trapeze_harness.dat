50|$|Based on {{the hull}} of the International 14 (I-14), a former Olympic class boat, the Jet is a plum-bow two-person sloop-rigged sailboat. The Jet 14 {{provides}} moderate-level performance for a dinghy sailboat. It does not require features such as a <b>trapeze</b> <b>harness,</b> although the hull is capable of planing.|$|E
50|$|The Flying Dutchman (FD) is a 20-foot one-design {{high-performance}} two-person monohull racing dinghy. Developed in {{the early}} 1950s in the Netherlands, its large sail area per unit weight allow it to plane easily when sailing upwind. The boat utilizes a <b>trapeze</b> <b>harness</b> for the crew and hiking straps for the skipper to counterbalance the wind force on its sails. It made its Olympic debut at the 1960 Olympics Games.|$|E
50|$|Beer can races {{allow people}} to {{experience}} yacht racing in a more relaxed environment {{than that of a}} major offshore race. They typically offer races on short courses. Many restrict the use of spinnakers, <b>trapeze</b> <b>harnesses,</b> and the use of twin headsails.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to safety}} concerns, the International Sailing Federation {{changed the rules}} in 2004 {{concerning}} <b>trapeze</b> <b>harnesses,</b> effective January 1, 2009: [...] "40.2 A <b>trapeze</b> or hiking <b>harness</b> shall have a device capable of quickly releasing the competitor from the boat at all times while in use.‚Äù However, the ISAF 2009-2013 Racing Rules of Sailing which took effect January 1, 2009 does not include this provision, so this rule change is postponed.|$|R
50|$|In sailing, the trapeze {{refers to}} a wire {{that comes from a}} point high on the mast, usually where the shrouds are fixed, to a hook on the crew member's harness at {{approximately}} waist level. The position when extended on the trapeze is outside the hull, braced against it (or an extension of it outwards) with the soles of the feet, facing the masthead, and clipped on by a hook on the <b>trapeze</b> <b>harness.</b> This gives the crew member more leverage to keep the boat flat by allowing the crew member's centre of gravity to balance the force of the wind in the sails.|$|E
