After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> of society.|$|E

Thus, starting off by assuming <b>the</b> concept of <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> we propose to define strong social and environmental sustainability preserving <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>goods</b> of humanity, and to use money as a public good, allowing to pay for non-marketable services. <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> political economy, internalisation, non-marketable services, public good, sustainability, productive labor...|$|R

Its relevance and limitations, due to incomparability with some mainstream economics, will be underlined.

25|$|The arguably most {{influential}} of Pătrășcanu's writings remains {{his analysis of}} the Romanian intelligentsia, part of Probleme de bază ale României. Transcending Leninist rhetoric, the work postulates a characteristic inability of Romanian intellectuals in sacrificing petty politics for <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> and argues that Romanian elites, while in subservience to the State, have traditionally been attracted to extremism.

40|$|Public {{security}} agency {{response to a}} call for emergency service is a <b>commons</b> <b>good.</b> As consumers demand more of <b>the</b> <b>commons</b> <b>good</b> there is increased congestion. Police services as a <b>commons</b> <b>good</b> are modeled using the uncertainty about which calls for service are bona fide. The results are that optimal alarm systems per officer rise with the officers' wage, fall with the value of avoided losses and rise with the productivity of officers. Ceteris paribus, avoided losses are greater in the community with more alarm systems. Homogeneity of the community increases the optimal number of alarms per officer. Fining 'well-behaved' alarm owners more heavily increases police productivity.
