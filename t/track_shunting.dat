50|$|In 1999, {{the line}} north from the {{passenger}} station to Pirmasens freight yard was permanently closed so that modernisation {{of the station}} could begin in 2001. This involved returning the station from five platform tracks to three <b>tracks.</b> <b>Shunting</b> is no longer possible.|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} coal was transported from the mines to Bexbach station in horse carts and later from Frankenholz by ropeway conveyor. With {{the closure of}} the Bexbach and Frankenholz pits in 1959, freight traffic at the Bexbach station {{drastically}} declined. Today there are two through <b>tracks,</b> three <b>shunting</b> <b>tracks</b> and a siding with a total of 13 sets of points. The goods shed was built in 1872/73.|$|R
50|$|West of {{the station}} are {{carriage}} sidings with a turntable and the Karlsruhe depot of DB Regio. East {{of the station}} {{there is a second}} set of carriage sidings. A connecting <b>track</b> allows <b>shunting</b> between the station and Karlsruhe freight yard.|$|R
50|$|Сatastrophic {{flooding}} of September 23, 1924, seriously {{damaged the}} <b>tracks</b> that formed <b>Shunting</b> loop 2 verst. The shunting loop was dismantled and by 1925 {{did not exist}} any more.|$|R
50|$|A {{terminal}} {{facility on}} the future depot site had already been built by 1905. The tramcar shed and the workshop were opened on 1 July 1907. Until about 1924, tramcars could reach {{two of the four}} depot tracks only by transter table. A second four-track tramcar shed was opened in 1909. Line 10 tramcars used depot <b>tracks</b> for <b>shunting</b> until 1926.|$|R
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Norwegian State Railways in 1883, Hamar Station became the administrative site for Hamar District. This would by 1924 reach an area consisting of the Dovre Line from Eidsvoll Station to Dombås Station, the Rauma Line, and the Røros Line north to Tynset Station. From 1880 to 1931 Hamar Station received a high amount of activity from its role as transshipment point between the narrow-gauge Røros Line and the standard gauge Eidsvoll–Sel Line. With increasing traffic the station area grew gradually, with an increasing number of tracks, built without any long-term plan. By 1916 there were 96 switches, resulting in low speeds, inefficient and unreliable operation. Despite the number of <b>tracks,</b> <b>shunting</b> often had to be done on the main line. The track arrangements were not cleaned up until the gauge conversion on the Røros Line was completed in 1931. The following year a new interlocking system was installed.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{bottlenecks}} in the logistic {{planning process}} at Netherlands Railways is {{the capacity of}} the infrastructure at the larger railway stations. To provide passenger trains with the right composition of rolling stock, many shunting movements between platform <b>tracks</b> and <b>shunting</b> areas are necessary, especially just before and after the peak hours. These shunting movements use the same infrastructure as the timetabled passenger and cargo trains. In this paper we describe a capacity test that has been developed to test at any moment during the planning process, whether {{the capacity of the}} infrastructure between the platform <b>tracks</b> and the <b>shunting</b> areas is sufficient for facilitating all the shunting movements that have to be planned in between the already timetabled train movements. With this test it is not necessary anymore to plan every detail of the shunting movements far before the actual operations. The capacity test is based on a mixed integer programming model. The running time of the Branch-and-Bound algorithm of CPLEX 9. 0 is sufficiently small, as was observed in computational experiments related to three stations in the Netherlands...|$|R
50|$|Kawane-Ryōgoku Station has {{a single}} side {{platform}} joined to an island platform by a level crossing.

The small station building is unmanned.|$|R
40|$|In {{rail freight}} operation, freight cars {{need to be}} {{separated}} and reformed into new trains at hump yards. The classification procedure is complex and hump yards constitute bottlenecks in the rail freight network, often causing outbound trains to be delayed. One {{of the problems is}} that planning for the allocation of tracks at hump yards is difficult, given that the planner has limited resources (<b>tracks,</b> <b>shunting</b> engines, etc.) and needs to foresee the future capacity requirements when planning for the current inbound trains. In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating classification tracks in a rail freight hump yard for arriving and departing trains with predetermined arrival and departure times. The core problem can be formulated as a special list coloring problem. We focus on an extension where individual cars can temporarily be stored on a special subset of the tracks. An extension where individual cars can temporarily be stored on a special subset of the tracks is also considered. We model the problem using mixed integer programming, and also propose several heuristics that can quickly give feasible track allocations. As a case study, we consider a real-world problem instance from the Hallsberg Rangerbangård hump yard in Sweden. Planning over horizons over two to four days, we obtain feasible solutions from both the exact and heuristic approaches that allow all outgoing trains to leave on time. RANPLA...|$|R
50|$|Fujine Station {{consists}} of a single island platform. The station building has automated ticket machines, automated turnstiles and has been unmanned since 1998.

50|$|When {{passengers}} had alighted, {{the train}} was reversed onto a side line {{which led to the}} goods shed and the wool loading platform, back in the direction of Aramac Creek. Here goods and parcels were unloaded into the shed which still stands, and a row of trucks and wagons lined up {{on the other side of}} the concrete platform to collect merchandise for the town's businesses. The Aramac yard had four <b>tracks</b> for <b>shunting,</b> and a triangle running east from the main line for turning the locomotives. That line also led to the sheep and cattle loading ramps and yards, east of the station.|$|R
50|$|In {{line with}} Bathurst's {{status as the}} main {{regional}} station the railway environs were lit by gas lamps in 1878, the gas lighting of the railway facilities continued until 1934.

50|$|As of 2012 {{locomotives}} of {{this type}} are still in service with Tata Steel Europe in the UK. In January 2012 the steel works in Lackenby imported ten 1500 kW ex-NSB Di8 Bo'Bo' locomotives for the torpedo wagon trains - this will result {{in several of the}} GEC locomotives being scrapped though some are expected to be retained for <b>track</b> renewal and <b>shunting</b> work.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 June 1967 which was Queen's Birthday weekend, Christiansen had {{followed}} friend Gary Winters and his father Mick to the railway yard near Te Maunga to bag coal for sale {{to raise money for}} charity.

50|$|The two-tracked narrow-gauge {{station on}} the street-side of the station was in the {{forecourt}} of the station building. Several <b>shunting</b> <b>tracks</b> for freight traffic were connected to this on the north-west side of the station. Two of these tracks were equipped with rollbock pits, allowing the standard-gauge wagons to be loaded on narrow-gauge transporters. With {{the end of the}} narrow-gauge operations in 1935, these tracks were dismantled.|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} single {{direction}} ABS lines {{is the use}} of non-interlocked crossovers to facilitate wrong direction running or trains reversing direction away from a traditional terminal. Operated by hand or from a ground frame, these facilities made use of <b>track</b> circuit <b>shunts</b> and time locked points to ensure that any approaching train would be brought to a standstill before encountering the obstruction. While reversing direction onto the other track required no outside intervention, running against the defined current of traffic would require train orders or the services of a pilotman and such ABS crossovers would feature either telephone communications with the train dispatcher or a structure that could serve as a temporary block station.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the narrow-gauge railway was dismantled, but the {{buildings}} of the narrow-gauge line remained for some time. The coal-loading facility, for example, was demolished only in 1982. Since 1991, the industrial railway, which now only connects to a drive shaft factory and a Volkswagen works, has been integrated into {{the eastern part of}} the station since the 1980s. The remaining part of the industrial railway was converted into a <b>shunting</b> <b>track</b> on 30 April 1999.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} model was a modified Yorkshire steam tractor, fitted with jacks {{at the front}} to allow a separate bogie to be manoeuvred into position underneath the front axle to guide it on the rails. Without the bogie, the vehicle could still be driven on ordinary roads and {{had the advantage of}} being able to be detached and run around the train, without requiring special loops for that purpose. For reversing on the <b>track,</b> as when <b>shunting,</b> the rear wheels were modified to be steerable.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} multi-stage {{train formation}} with mixed usage tracks at a marshalling yard without departure yard. A novel integer programming model for scheduling shunting tasks {{as well as}} allocating arrival yard tracks and classification bowl tracks is presented. By taking a comprehensive view of the marshalling yard operations, more effective schedules can be found, {{and a variety of}} characteristics can be optimised, including shunting work effort, number or cost of <b>tracks,</b> and <b>shunting</b> task start times. Two different objective functions are evaluated: minimising work effort in terms of wagon pull-backs and minimising track costs. A procedure for finding a hot-start solution with few wagon pull-backs is also presented. The proposed model is tested on real data from Sävenäs marshalling yard in Sweden. The results show that the method is able to return an optimal schedule for a planning period of 4 days if the hot-start solution is optimal or the remaining problem is tractable for the heuristics in CPLEX. ...|$|R
50|$|The 'rest signal' (Ruhesignal) on a Bavarian {{home signal}} was signalled using an {{additional}} aspect: 'rest' (Ruhe). It {{was used in}} Bavaria from 1893 to 1975. It was the last signal from the state railway era that was retained in the signalling book of the Deutsche Bundesbahn.This was a single or twin-armed semaphore signal, which took over the function of an exist signal and enhanced it with an additional signal aspect: 'rest' (Ruhe, HpRu). The term 'rest' meant that the railway vehicles were {{to remain on the}} allocated <b>track,</b> although <b>shunting</b> was permitted. If the arm was moved to its default position (Halt) the associated track was to be immediately cleared. The aspect, 'rest', was indicated by a downward-pointing semaphore arm or, at night, by a blue light. The Deutsche Reichsbahn marked the signal with an additional board with the letters Ru on it, in order to distinguish it from a normal home signal. The semaphore arm of the rest signal had the same dimensions as those of the Bavarian home signals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we propose a graph {{theoretical}} approach to the problem of train shunting in a railway depot. Especially during the night, the trains have to be parked in a shunting depot {{in such a way that}} the operations in the next morning can start as smoothly as possible. The general problem is very difficult and includes many subproblems. We focus on the following subproblem: how to arrange the trains in a “correct” order on the available <b>tracks</b> by avoiding <b>shunting</b> operations for outgoing trains of the morning. We discuss different cases of the problem, and we propose both algorithmic solutions and heuristic approaches...|$|R

40|$|Return {{collectors}} are predominant organs for rubber-tyred subways to operatesince they ensure {{both the}} <b>track</b> circuit <b>shunt</b> and the traction current return. Po- sitioned at {{the interface between}} the track and the rolling stock, they are subjected to the disruptions linked to the train movement and the track irregularities. One {{of the most critical}} steps is the crossing of a switch nose. This study aims at determining the collector position during this crossing by means of a quasi-static analysis of the system. Two approaches are investigated. The first one brings into play a rigid contact and geometrical angles. It enables to model the crossing until the contact with the crossing nose. The diving capability of the collector is also taken into account. The second one is a standard  approach of the contact. A slight penetration is considered, which allows to grasp the contact with  the crossing nose. The second advantage  is to prepare the ground for a complete dynamical analysis. Both approaches are then implemented on Matlab to solve the equations. Finally the study of the switch crossing in nominal conditionsand a parametric analysis are achieved for a specified switch...|$|R

40|$|How to {{deal with}} a {{disruption}} is a question railway companies face on a daily basis. This thesis focusses on the subject how to handle a disruption such that the passenger service is upheld as much as possible. The current mathematical models for disruption management can not yet be applied in practice, because several important practical considerations are not taken into account. In this thesis several models are presented which take important practical details into account: (1) Creating a macroscopic global feasible solution for all three resource schedules, instead of focussing on one individual resource schedule. (2) Scheduled maintenance appointments required by certain rolling stock units are included while rescheduling. (3) Dead-heading trips to transfer rolling stock units from stations with a surplus of inventory to stations with a shortage of inventory. (4) Adjusted passenger demand, the passenger demand is not static, but depends on the capacity appointed to the previous trips. Finally, (5) Checking whether a rolling stock circulation is feasible with respect to the available depot <b>tracks</b> (the <b>shunting</b> yard) within a station. We make use of different techniques to solve the models, for instance, mixed integer linear programming, column generation, constraint programming, and heuristic models are used in this thesis. The results demonstrate that these five practical considerations can be taken into account in the disruption management models...|$|R
50|$|After {{the closure}} of the line in 1928, two W. G.

5000|$|With the {{rebuilding}} of the station as a Haltepunkt (a “halt”, that is not having points) for passenger trains and the associated dismantling of platforms and trackwork, the platform next to the station building still exists but is no longer used, while the former island platform has been removed entirely. Instead two 76 cm-high external platforms were built just {{to the south of}} the former station building (and closer to the town) as a replacement of the original platforms. Both are accessed by stairs from Beyenburger Straße and by barrier-free access from Von-Boltenberg-Straße (to the western platform serving trains towards Lennep, Remscheid and Solingen) and the ramp from Grünenplatzstraße (to the eastern platform serving trains towards Oberbarmen and Wuppertal). On this platform, there is a DB Pluspunkt vending machine. Both platforms are equipped with tactile paving, single-line dynamic passenger information displays and speakers. [...] Since the redesign of the station’s tracks, there are still three functional through sidings, freight and <b>shunting</b> <b>tracks</b> and a freight transport hub, which is still regularly used to serve the Dirostahl company, a steelworks and rolling mill near the station. The rail freight traffic can now only run over the line via Oberbarmen and Ronsdorf because freight trains have been banned from operating over the Müngsten Bridge for several years. The former gravel works and the current concrete factory, which formerly had its own gravel loading facility and siding, is now only served by road transport.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the situation of}} rearranging freight trains in a shunting yard with a hump and several tracks. Here, an elementary shunting operation is to push a all cars of one track over the hump. On {{the way back to}} the tracks the cars can be guided individually to an arbitrary track. The goal is to create one or several trains that have their cars in a particular order. We measure the efficiency of a shunting plan by the number of elementary shunting operations, and to a lesser extent by the total number of car movements. We find optimal shunting operations in the following situations: – The incoming trains are unsorted and the shunting yard has sufficiently many tracks but the length of the tracks is limited (capacities). – The order of the cars in a single incoming train is given, the <b>tracks</b> of the <b>shunting</b> yard are sufficiently long, but there is only a limited number of tracks. In contrast, we show that the following problems are N P-complete: – There are several incoming trains and for each the order of the cars is given, but the order in which to start shunting the trains can be chosen. – There is one train with given order of the cars, and the lengths of the tracks is limited. These results are based on expressing the shunting task as finding a suitable set of codes. The results will perhaps not solve the practical problem directly, but rather provide some first structural insights and complexity limits that can guide the search for practical algorithms. ...|$|R
