40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{financial}} statements of industrial firms to develop an integrated firm's eye view {{of the changes in}} the Uruguayan economy during 1973 - 81. In the first of three subperiods, 1973 - 75, real financial costs were very negative and tended to offset low returns on operating assets. During 1976 - 78 the dismantling of interest rate controls increased real financial costs, but other factors increased the returns on operating assets more rapidly. During 1979 - 81 financial costs jumped enough to more than absorb increases in gross earnings, which were probably due to Argentine demand. The rates of earning and capital formation were highest among exporters in the the second subperiod, when a major export promotion program was in place. This pattern was reversed in the <b>third</b> <b>subperiod,</b> as the promotion programs were dismantled and real currency appreciation seemed to squeeze gross earnings of exportables relatively more. This unequal squeezing was probably due to redundant tariff and other protection for import-competing producers...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} survey {{of changes in}} the reserve requirement system in Brazil and analyze the system's main functions and goals during the period from 1994 to 2012. We identify four different subperiods with respect to the use of this policy tool. In the first subperiod, from july 1994 to the end of 1998, reserve requirements were used intensively to stabilize the money supply, credit aggregates and the exchange rate, in the context of strong disinflation and growth of monetization and aggregate demand. In the second subperiod, from 1999 to 2004, the Central Bank used reserve requirements less actively, but still relied on this tool to reinforce the cycles of monetary tightening and easing. During the <b>third</b> <b>subperiod,</b> from 2004 to 2008, changes in the reserve requirement system were little significant and apparently were unrelated to the general objetives of monetary policy. In the fourth subperiod, beginning in 2008, reserve requirements were again used intensively, with the main objective of providing liquidity to the banking system, but also as a tool for aggregate demand management and for selective credit allocation...|$|E
30|$|The {{results in}} Table  5 {{also show that}} there is a decline in the {{t-statistic}} of the mood variable. For example, in the VW portfolio, the t-statistics in the first, second, and <b>third</b> <b>subperiods</b> are 9.30, 4.75, and − 0.34, respectively. In the EW portfolio, the t-statistics are 11.33, 13.13, and 8.23, respectively. Thus, the decline in the magnitude of the t-statistics is much more pronounced in the VW portfolio.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{response}} of Latin American stock markets to movements in European stock markets using VAR models. Our results {{vary depending on the}} openness of the country in terms of international trade. We find evidence that Latin American stock markets are responsive to changes in the stock market from Spain. Additionally, during the second and <b>third</b> <b>subperiods,</b> Spain has much stronger ties with Brazil, and this might explain why Brazil responds more to the shocks originating from Spain than from France. In conclusion, this study uncovers two important findings. First, Spain influences Latin American markets but these responses are not homogeneous across markets. Second, the influence of Spain has different magnitude in the three subperiods. Emerging Markets, Latin America, Stock Markets Interdependence, VAR...|$|R
30|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations for {{the decline in the}} magnitude of the t-statistics of the mood variable. One possible source for this decline is the general decline of the day-of-the-week effect as documented in the previous subsection. The second possible explanation is that the ability of mood to explain the effect has declined. It appears to us that this reflects more of a general decline in the magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect than a decline in the ability of mood to explain it. The basis for this conjecture {{is the fact that the}} proportion of variation of average abnormal returns explained by the mood variable, as measured by the ratio of R 2, does not show a declining trend over time. For example, in the EW portfolio, the proportion of variation of average abnormal returns explained by the mood variable in the first, second, and <b>third</b> <b>subperiods</b> is 64.1 %, 85.8 %, and 85.5 %, respectively. Similar results can be seen in the small capitalization deciles. We conclude, therefore, that the reduction in the magnitude of the t-statistics of the mood variable is more likely the result of the general decline in the magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect than a decline in the ability of mood to explain the effect.|$|R
30|$|The {{results in}} Table  4 {{also suggest that}} the {{magnitude}} of the day-of-the-week effect has declined over time. This can be observed {{in the size of the}} F-statistics in the EW and VW portfolios. In the VW portfolio, the F-statistic is 26.92 in the first subperiod, 6.51 in the second subperiod, and 0.30 in the <b>third</b> <b>subperiod.</b> In the EW portfolio, the F-statistics are 34.72, 37.25, and 15.00, respectively. Hence, although not entirely smooth in the EW portfolio, there is a general tendency of decline in {{the magnitude of the}} day-of-the-week effect. Note also that, as part of this decline, the effect disappeared in the last subperiod in the largest capitalization decile (decile 10) and in the VW portfolio. In decile 9, the effect became borderline significant. The effect remains, however, statistically significant in all other 8 deciles and in the EW portfolio in the last subperiod. Consistent with other studies, we conclude that these results show a decline in the magnitude of the effect over time (see, for example, Brusa et al. 2000; Gu 2004; Kohers et al. 2004; Mehdian and Perry 2001; Kamara 1997). The evidence, however, does not suggest that the effect has vanished.|$|E
40|$|Thirty two Canchim {{suckling}} calves, maintained on {{rotational grazing}} system of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, were divided in three groups corresponding to three evaluated treatments: control (without creep-feeding); SAL 5 (addition of 5 % of NaCl to concentrate fed in creep-feeding); and SAL 10 (addition of 10 % of NaCl to concentrate fed in creep-feeding). Feeding in a creep-feeding system lasted 90 days, divided in three subperiods of 30 days. The body weight gain was {{greater in the}} subperiods 1 and 2 for SAL 10 and SAL 5 treatments, respectively. There were no differences in the <b>third</b> <b>subperiod</b> and, in the overall period, the SAL 10 treatment (0. 91 kg. animal- 1. day- 1) was better than control treatment (0. 81 kg,animal- 1. day- 1). The monthly remuneration provided by the treatments SAL 5 e SAL 10 related to the control group were- 12. 5 and 6. 0 %, respectively. The body weight differentials at weaning, compared to the control group, for creep-feeding provide a monthly net profit of 0, 0. 6, 1. 2, and 6. 0 % should be 10. 8, 11. 0, 11. 2, and 12. 8 kg. animal- 1 for SAL 5 and 7. 6, 7. 7, 7. 8, and 9. 0 kg. animal- 1 for SAL 10. It was concluded that the limited supplement intake in creep-feeding was necessary to obtain economic viability...|$|E
3000|$|... nThe {{history of}} Chinese {{industrial}} development and adjustment since 1978 can be roughly {{divided into four}} subperiods (shown in Table  1): (1) The first subperiod is from 1978 (when the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee convened) to October 1984 (when the Third Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee convened), when the rural and agricultural reforms beginning from {{the introduction of the}} household contract responsibility system became the major driving force of economic development and have solved the problem of feeding the Chinese people. (2) From October 1984 to June 1992, the reforms of state-owned industrial enterprises in cities centering on adjusting ownership structure and rejuvenating enterprises themselves, and the development of township enterprises, have greatly promoted the growth of light industries. As a result, consumer goods became more and more varied, durable consumer goods became popular, and the situation wherein commodities were in short supply has changed fundamentally. (3) From June 1992 (when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the ‘Decision on Speeding up the Development of the Tertiary Industry’) to December 2001 (when China joined the WTO), the reforms in services began in full swing. (4) Since China's accession to WTO, more industrial reforms and adjustments have been launched to face both internal and external challenges with China's increasing integration {{with the rest of the}} world. The economic situation since the <b>third</b> <b>subperiod</b> is also discussed in the text.|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{research}} indicates that subgroups, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 strategic groups 2 ̆ 2, within an industry exhibit different performance consequences for similar strategic actions and environmental changes. A strategic group {{is defined as a}} set of firms within an industry that compete alike. This research effort applies the strategic group concept to a study {{of the structure of the}} property and liability insurance industry. The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of competition and performance in the insurance industry from a strategic perspective. ^ Data for fifty-seven property and liability insurance fleets were gathered from A. M. Best Company sources. The time period under study encompassed the nine years 1981 through 1989. ^ Strategic variables define strategic positioning in terms of similarity of strategic scope and resource deployment commitments. These variables describe geographic and product diversification, financial commitments to functional areas, and scale of operations. Variance-covariance matrix equality tests evaluate strategic changes over time. Four distinct subperiods of stable strategic structures are evident during the time period studied. ^ Within each stable strategic subperiod, cluster analysis procedures identify strategic group membership. Group membership proved to be transitory across the nine years studied. A large number of membership changes occurred and new groups emerged routinely. The number of groups in each stable strategic time period ranged from eight in the first subperiod to thirteen in the <b>third</b> <b>subperiod.</b> ^ Following the establishment of group membership, hypotheses are tested for differences in the levels of economic impact. The performance dimensions analyzed are return on assets, risk, and risk adjusted return. ^ Significant differences along the return dimensions are found between strategic groups in all subperiods. These findings are consistent with the theory. Risk differences, however, are noted strongly only in the first subperiod and weakly in the second subperiod. Significant differences between groups also are not indicated during any of the subperiods when returns are adjusted for varying levels of risk. ...|$|E
