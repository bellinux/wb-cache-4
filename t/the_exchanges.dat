5|$|Established the {{creation}} of health insurance exchanges in all fifty states. <b>The</b> <b>exchanges</b> are regulated, largely online marketplaces, administered by either federal or state government, where individuals and small business can purchase private insurance plans.|$|E
5|$|The launch {{for both}} the state and federal exchanges was troubled due to {{management}} and technical failings. HealthCare.gov, the website that offers insurance through <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered endless problems.

(2) The influence of domestic interest rates, output and <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate on <b>the</b> money supply in Indonesia. Data used time series of (I year kuartal 2000 – IV year kuartal 2010). This article use analyzer model equation of simultaneous with method of Two Stage Least Squared (TSLS). The result of research concludes that (1) the money supply have a significant and positive impact on <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, incomes have significant and positive impact on <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, domestic interest rates significantly and negatively on <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate and inflation have a significant and positive impact on <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate.

If the money supply increases, <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate will also increase or depreciate. If income increases, <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate will depreciate. If the domestic interest rate increases, <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate will appreciate. If inflation increases, <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate will also depreciate.

5|$|Businesses {{that employ}} 50 {{or more people}} but do not offer health {{insurance}} to their full-time employees pay a tax penalty if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This {{is commonly known as}} the employer mandate. This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> began operating. Approximately 44% of the population was covered directly or indirectly through an employer.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, nearly 70% {{of those}} on <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> could {{purchase}} insurance for less than $75/month after subsidies, which rose to offset significant pre-subsidy price increases in the exchange markets. Healthcare premium cost increases in the employer market continued to moderate. For example, healthcare premiums for those covered by employers rose by 69% from 2000-2005, but only 27% from 2010 to 2015, with only a 3% increase from 2015 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits pending (House v. Price) such {{as whether}} cost-sharing {{subsidies}} must be paid. President Trump threatened not to pay these subsidies in early 2017 and later decided to stop paying them. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15-20 percentage points to health insurance costs on <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>exchange</b> in chess {{refers to}} a {{situation}} in which one player loses a minor piece (i.e. a bishop or knight) but captures the opponent's rook. The side which wins the rook is said to have won <b>the</b> <b>exchange,</b> while <b>the</b> other player has lost <b>the</b> <b>exchange,</b> since <b>the</b> rook is usually more valuable. Alternatively, the side that has won the rook is up <b>the</b> <b>exchange,</b> and <b>the</b> other player is down <b>the</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>The</b> opposing captures often happen on consecutive moves, although this is not strictly necessary. It is generally detrimental to lose <b>the</b> <b>exchange,</b> although occasionally one may find reason to purposely do so; the result is an exchange sacrifice (see below). <b>The</b> minor <b>exchange</b> is an uncommon term for <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> of a bishop and knight.|$|R
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E
5|$|Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), {{also known}} as FBO Pictures Corporation, was an American film studio of the silent era, a {{producer}} and distributor of mostly low-budget films. The business began in 1918 as Robertson-Cole (U.S.), the American division of a British import–export company and Robertson-Cole was formed by the English-born Harry F. Robertson and the American Rufus Sidman Cole. Robertson-Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges (formerly the Mutual Exchanges that became known as Exhibitors-Mutual Exchanges) from Frank J. Hall in 1920. Exhibitors-Mutual/Hallmark had distributed Robertson-Cole product, and acquiring <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> gave {{them the right to}} distribute their own films plus Hall's product, with the exception of Charlie Chaplin reissues which he had the rights to.|$|E
5|$|Households {{with incomes}} between 100% and 400% {{of the federal}} poverty level were {{eligible}} to receive federal subsidies for policies purchased via an exchange. Subsidies are provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credits. Additionally, small businesses are eligible for a tax credit provided that they enroll in the SHOP Marketplace. Under the law, workers whose employers offer affordable coverage will not be eligible for subsidies via <b>the</b> <b>exchanges.</b> To be eligible the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker's household income.|$|E

We clarified, that the coercitivity disappeared and <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> bias reduced with the temperature. It is shown, that the coercitivity grows with the core radius. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> bias field shows the non-uniform dependence, {{because it is a}} function of outer layer type.

5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering gravitation {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After <b>the</b> <b>exchanges</b> with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E

40|$|Using thermal {{quantum field}} theory we derive an {{expression}} for <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constant that resembles Fukuyama's formula for the orbital magnetic susceptibility (OMS). Guided by this formal analogy between <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constant and OMS we identify a contribution to <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constant that arises from the geometrical properties of the band structure in mixed phase space. We compute <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constants for free electrons and show that the geometrical contribution is generally important. Our formalism allows us to study <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constants in <b>the</b> presence of spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Thereby, we find sizable differences between <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constants of helical and cycloidal spin spirals. Furthermore, we discuss how to calculate <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constants based on a gauge-field approach {{in the case of}} the Rashba model with an additional exchange splitting and show that <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> constants obtained from this gauge-field approach are in perfect agreement with those obtained from the quantum field theoretical method...|$|R
