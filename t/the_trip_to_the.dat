5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. Keep the money and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
5|$|Under Hall's command, the Polaris {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871. By October, {{the men were}} wintering {{on the shore of}} northern Greenland, making preparations for <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him. An exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed that he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic {{in the last two weeks}} of his life.|$|E

5|$|Like Borussia, Feyenoord faced {{opposition}} {{from the city of}} Milan in the semi-finals, in the shape of Internazionale. Around 10,000 Feyenoord fans made <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scene of Feyenoord’s 1970 European Cup victory for the first leg. Feyenoord won the first leg 1–0 to gain a vital away goal after Iván Córdoba scored an own goal. The second leg started well for Feyenoord after going 2–0 up inside 34 minutes, due to goals from Van Hooijdonk and Jon Dahl Tomasson, to put Feyenoord 3–0 up on aggregate. Inter came back into the tie in the last minutes when they pulled two goals back through Javier Zanetti and Mohamed Kallon, but Feyenoord secured their place in the final with a 3–2 aggregate victory.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. <b>The</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail {{is the most popular}} trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Summiting Everest {{with disabilities}} such as amputations and {{diseases}} has become {{popular in the}} 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who {{made it to the}} top in 2013. A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Himalayas and rustic scenery. Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches.

25|$|By {{the second}} week of August 1778 Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the Chukchi Sea. He headed {{north-east}} up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice. His furthest north was 70 degrees 44 minutes. Cook then sailed west to the Siberian coast, and then south-east down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778 he was back in the Bering Sea to begin <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage, and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat walrus meat, which they had pronounced inedible.|$|E

While on <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> murder scene, Douglas brought the Crown Solicitor of Vancouver Island in order to uphold the law and make a show that demonstrated British law was still in effect. During this trip he encountered a great number of squatting foreigners, reducing the total possible revenues for land sales to the government.|$|E

25|$|Palenville, a small hamlet at {{the eastern}} edge of the Catskill Escarpment, is marked by a traffic light at the {{northern}} end of NY32A, a connector that shortens <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hunter–Tannersville area for those coming south on the New York State Thruway (Interstate87). Just past the junction is Rowena Memorial School, a local landmark. Going further east, NY23A crosses much gentler but still largely undeveloped terrain as it traverses the town of Catskill. It reaches NY32 itself at an undeveloped intersection prior to crossing Kaaterskill Creek and the Thruway near the grades of an abandoned interchange. From the Thruway, it heads generally northeastward through a small valley to the western edge of the village of Catskill, where it ends at a junction with US9W.
