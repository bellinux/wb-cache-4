5|$|Initially, the {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory governed the Louisiana District (which included St. Louis), and the district's organizational law forbade the foreign slave trade and reduced the influence of St. Louis in the region.

From <b>the</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Louisiana Territory in 1812 to Missouri statehood in 1821, St. Louis was the capital of the Missouri Territory.|$|E
