25|$|The {{original}} Sakura Wars was {{an ambitious}} project {{that many of}} its core staff did not <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a commercial success. Upon release, it was a critical and commercial success. Riding {{on the success of}} Sakura Wars, Sega greenlit a sequel. The game was co-developed by Red Company and Sega CS2 R, who had produced the original game. Oji Hiroi returned as producer, Shinichi Ito as director, Satoru Akahori as writer, Hidenori Matsubara and K≈çsuke Fujishima as the character designers, and Kohei Tanaka as composer. Teruyu Terada, who would later work on the PlayStation 2 remake of Sakura Wars, acted as battle designer.|$|E
500|$|After {{these shows}} were completed, Gorham {{confirmed}} that extended Thin Lizzy tours were probably {{a thing of}} the past, but that the band would continue to perform in one-off events. He stated, [...] "To kill it off stone dead I <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the wrong thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been [...] "very adamant" [...] that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added [...] "There is a bond there that I <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing".|$|E

6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> uncle," [...] Tom said. [...] "From {{the look}} of the stuff I should <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite as tough as shoe leather and as tasteless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{right at}} all," [...] said Lady Baldock, with much energy. [...] "I <b>think</b> he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wrong,--shamefully wrong. They {{say he is}} the son of an Irish doctor, and that he hasn't a {{shilling}} in the world." ...|$|R
500|$|Explaining how Ben Stiller {{came to be}} cast in {{the role}} of Greg, Roach states: [...] "I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream, and in my view nobody plays that kind of {{material}} better than Ben." [...] Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller's creative and ad lib abilities stating that [...] "he has lots of great ideas and he's very skilled at loose improvisation." [...] Stiller's character Gaylord [...] "Greg" [...] Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film's script was initially written with Jim Carrey {{in the role of}} Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E
2500|$|There can be [...] "refreshed" [...] shocks if {{the central}} engine {{continues}} to release fast-moving matter {{in small amounts}} even out to late times, these new shocks will {{catch up with the}} external shock to produce something like a late-time internal shock. This explanation has been invoked to explain the frequent flares seen in X-rays and at other wavelengths in many bursts, though some theorists are uncomfortable with the apparent demand that the progenitor (which one would <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by the GRB) continues to remain active for very long.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old Bicky didn't {{want to go}} to that ranch," [...] I explained. [...] "He doesn't like {{cows and}} horses, but he rather <b>thinks</b> he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> hot stuff among the hens. All he wants is a bit of capital. Don't you <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rather a wheeze if you were to----" ...|$|R

I do <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best to {{let me have a}} talk with them, and tell them all about it, before you appear upon the scene." ...|$|R
2500|$|If a {{government}} loses a [...] "non-confidence" [...] motion traditionally the Prime Minister {{will ask the}} Governor General to call an election. The Governor General when approached by the Prime Minister who has lost {{a vote of confidence}} will traditionally call an election. However it is not assured as some assume. The Governor General also has the right to call the leader of the party they <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> most {{likely to be able to}} form government and ask them if they can form the government. This happened in 1926 and is referred to as the King-Byng Affair.|$|E
2500|$|... ery bad, to {{have this}} fellow Hunt, ah, you know, ah, it's, he, he knows too damn much and he was {{involved}}, we happen to know that. And that it gets out that the whole, this is all involved in the Cuban thing, that it's a fiasco, and it's {{going to make the}} FBI, ah CIA look bad, it's going to make Hunt look bad, and it's likely to blow the whole, uh, Bay of Pigs thing which we <b>think</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very unfortunate for CIA and for the country at this time, and for American foreign policy, and he just better tough it and lay it on them.|$|E
2500|$|The London Government Act 1899 {{abolished}} the existing local authorities within the County of London and {{replaced them with}} 28 metropolitan boroughs. Among the bodies to be dissolved was the Court of Burgesses of the City of Westminster. William Burdett-Coutts, one of Westminster's members of parliament, brought forward an amendment to rename the proposed borough of Greater Westminster [...] to City of Westminster. This was intended to give [...] "recognition to the title which the area ... had possessed for over three and a half centuries". He felt that if the status was not retained for the new borough it [...] "must necessarily disappear altogether". The amendment was rejected by the government, however, with the First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour, believing it would be [...] "an anomaly which, I <b>think,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> not unnaturally resented by other districts which are as large in point of population as Westminster, although doubtless not so rich in historical associations". The government eventually relented, with Balfour stating that [...] "as soon as the necessary arrangements under the London Government Act have been completed, there will be conferred on the borough of Westminster, as constituted under the Act, the title of city, originally conferred in the time of Henry VIII". Letters patent were duly issued granting the title of [...] "city" [...] to the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E

He {{would want to}} control you entirely. He cannot allow {{that there is any}} other mind than his own. And then the real clumsiness of his mind is its lack of self-criticism. No, I <b>think</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{perfectly}} intolerable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Roland. I {{could tell}} you the stocks to which they belonged, but not the numbers.
