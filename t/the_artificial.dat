5|$|Black & White {{received}} universal acclaim on release; reviewers praised <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence, uniqueness, and depth, {{although the}} system requirements and bugs were criticised. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Guinness World Record for {{the complexity of}} <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence, selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered it to have been over-rated at the time. An expansion, , and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.|$|E
5|$|Electropalatography {{involves}} the use of a custom-fitted artificial palate containing electrodes that measure contact. While able to record multiple contacts, <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> palate may obstruct or interfere with articulation, and each subject requires a custom-fitted palate.|$|E

50|$|The Doctor {{arrives and}} orders {{the same thing}} and the {{fighting}} stops when he takes order of the ship. The Doctor reveals that he'd seen the Pilot's log and discovered that <b>the</b> <b>Artificials</b> were linked to the Pilot System. They'd be created when there was a problem; for instance the cyro-system failure which had apparently killed half the Colonists. The Doctor remarks that ALL of the Colonists were killed, meaning that everyone bar them on the ship was in fact an <b>Artificial.</b> Around them, <b>the</b> <b>Artificials</b> slowly comfort each other to Martha's amazement. The Doctor tells her that everyone is an Artificial now, but love is real.|$|R
5|$|Theme Hospital {{received}} positive reviews. Critics {{noted the}} strong gameplay, detailed graphics, satisfying comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence, and the user interface.|$|E
5|$|Cloud seeding {{was first}} {{attempted}} by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir. After witnessing <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> creation of ice crystals, Langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of weather modification.

5|$|Dismantling {{the sets}} cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking {{equipment}} {{was turned over}} to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> lake over to Cinecittà. MGM retained control over the costumes and <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> lake background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>artificial</b> {{object to}} reach another {{celestial}} body was Luna 2 in 1959. The first automatic landing on another celestial body {{was performed by}} Luna 9 in 1966. Luna 10 became <b>the</b> first <b>artificial</b> satellite of <b>the</b> Moon.|$|R

5|$|Ever 17 {{is set in}} Japan, in the {{underwater}} marine theme park LeMU, 51 meters {{below the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> island Insel Null. After an incident, almost half of LeMU is flooded, and the path to the surface and the communication lines are cut off, trapping the game's characters inside. In addition, LeMU is under large water pressure, limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Modem Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much more challenging than contests against <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> intelligence (AI), and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> process replaces the love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Martha {{discovers that}} the Steering Council want Edison dead because {{he fell in}} love with the young woman, Romea. Romea states that Edison didn't mean any harm but <b>the</b> <b>Artificials</b> were {{stronger}} than the humans. Edison and Romea had broken the rules by fraternising together and so they were both on the run. A fight breaks out between <b>the</b> <b>Artificials</b> and <b>the</b> Colonists as Martha tries to reach the Fabricator, which would provide everything needed to colonise the target world. As the fight continues, Martha is thrown against a wall after being caught in a collision between a Colonist and an Artificial. As Romea runs to her aid, she is held back and a Colonist approaches Martha with a large spanner. An Artificial protects her and Martha screams out for the fighting to stop.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>artificial</b> ice {{increased}} {{the popularity of}} playing ice hockey in the neighborhood. The club therefore started working on plans to build an indoor ice rink over <b>the</b> <b>artificial</b> rink. Planning of the hall started in 1989, and in 1990 {{a proposal for a}} steel structure was launched. However, it was rejected by the municipality. The club therefore hired Einar Dahle Arkitekter to work on a new design, resulting in area planning regulations being passed in 1991. Financing of the steel structure had been secured in loans, but these were stopped following a credit crunch. In 1994, the municipality initiated a redevelopment program of the downtown residential areas, which included grants to build Grünerhallen. The hall was estimated to cost NOK23.4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax. Construction started in March 1995 and the venue opened on 6 October 1995, as the 30th indoor ice rink in Norway. In 1996, the city council had to grant an additional NOK4.6 million to cover cost overruns.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>artificial</b> {{intelligence}} in Halo has been favorably received. Enemies take cover and use suppressive fire and grenades. Some enemies retreat when their superiors are killed.
