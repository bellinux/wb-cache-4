The objective {{is to improve the}} performance of heat-recovery by Organic Rankine Cycles, by using a recently-proposed thermofluidic pump. The thermofluidic pump promises low-cost, high-reliability, and, since it does not consume any of the power produced by the expander, improved return on investment. No performance data for the new thermofluidic pump have been reported previously, therefore a thermodynamic model is derived and used to evaluate performance metrics that characterise pump operation {{and its impact on the}} overall cycle efficiency. Improved pump configurations are then developed and analysed. A <b>two-stage</b> <b>pump</b> configuration is presented that enhances the thermal efficiency of the cycle. An economiser is also proposed in order to obtain boiler efficiencies similar to those for mechanical feed pumps. It has been shown that the cycle efficiency with the <b>two-stage</b> <b>pump</b> is maximum when there is no net heat input in the intermediate evaporator. The resulting thermal efficiency exceeds the best-possible efficiency that is obtainable with an ideal mechanical pump. The relative improvement in cycle efficiency achieved with the two-stage thermofluidic pump is greatest for low-temperature cycles operating below 100 °C, for which the back work ratio is usually higher and the efficiencies of electro-mechanical feed pumps are poorer – yielding a relative increase of the cycle efficiency by up to 30 %...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the phenomena that occur at off-design conditions, {{it is necessary}} to take into account unsteady ef¬fects that are mainly the consequences of rotor-stator inter¬actions. These interactions can now be analysed with the help of computer codes, but the numerical procedures still require experimental data for their validation. A numerical analysis of the flow in a low-pressure stage of a <b>two-stage</b> <b>pump</b> with a seven-blade runner, is pre¬sented with experimental valida¬tion at various opera-tion conditions. In order to focus upon the role of the stator-rotor inter-action on the unsteady effects and the recirculation on¬set, the single impeller was first analysed. Experimental and numerical analyses was carried out on the pump equipped with a van¬eless diffuser designed as the original multistage configuration of the vaned dif¬fuser passages. Successively, the annular cascade of stationary vanes was inserted and the influence of the stator/rotor interactions on the onset of unsteady reverse flow zones was analysed. The velocity components were measured in the vane-less part of the diffuser, and pressure measurements were performed on diffuser vanes surfaces. Furthermore, a piezo¬electric transducer placed flush with the wall was used to measure the mean pres¬sure level inside the blade channels in order to find a link between the flow field at part load and acoustic radiation. The experimental data were then compared with re-sults that were obtained with help of CFX-TASC Flow com¬puter code (AEA Technology), focusing on the chang-ing flow field at part load.

40|$|Aircraft {{fuel pumps}} {{are known to}} be the most loaded units of the gas turbine engines. Primary engine fuel pump is the key {{component}} limiting the reliability and endurance of the fuel system, and, as a result, the durability of the whole engine. This dissertation is devoted to development of the mathematical model allowing to describe the working processes inside of the two-stage aircraft engine fuel pump consisting of screw-centrifugal and gear stages. A finite-volume discretization method was realized in a commercial code ANSYS CFX and subsequently used for the Navier- Stokes equations solution. Developed mathematical model was verified and showed to produce good accuracy of pump performance estimation. Developed approach was used for CFD simulations of the ingestion process of free gas into the first stage of the pump. The CFD analysis has been used to calculate an unsteady three-dimensional viscous flow of multi-component fluid in the screw-centrifugal pump. Calculations have been made to determine unsteady loads of fuel pump in different operating modes. To examine the efficiency of the CFD analysis, a series of experiments have been conducted. The experimental results proved the accuracy of the numerical model. The results allowed to develop design modifications of the considered pump for reduction of its dynamic loads. The main focus in this study was addressing the reduction of dynamic loading of the twostage fuel pumps. It had to be done without any changes in operation modes of engine fuel system. Design modifications have been proposed to decrease the two-stage aircraft engine pump loading. This loading includes both pressure pulsation and the vibrational load. This dissertation describes theoretically and experimentally the efficiency of the proposed pump design modifications entering re-designs. The results illustrate how the proposed redesigns reduce the flow unsteadiness in the <b>two-stage</b> <b>pump</b> at its different operating regimes. Proposed construction changes enhance the reliability and endurance of aircraft engine fuel pumps. In addition, this dissertation describes the developed semi-natural test bench and measurement techniques which were applied for investigations of considered pump dynamic loading. The semi-natural test bench contains the mathematical model of the gas-turbine engine for research the fuel supply and control systems characteristics. A number of semi-natural and hardware-in-loop (HIL) test benches for investigation of both gas turbine engine’s fuel and control systems are shown. An aggregate composition of hydro-mechanical system and the methodology of the used testing technique are also presented. Some aspects of controlled object mathematical simulation and the basic approaches for its implementation are described. Developed bench allows to simulate and define the performances of the whole fuel system and its aggregates in steady-state and transient operating regimes in the closed and open loop circuits. Additionally, it allows to perform the analysis of available control system stability margins, to carry out the interaction of separate circuits and aggregates or to study influence the perturbations and external factors on control system fail safety. Finally, the theory of vortex resonance inside screw-centrifugal stage of the pump induced by its gear stage elements vibrations and trailing vortices is presented. The main idea of this theory is the coincidence of frequencies of trailing vortices, stalling from the screw and centrifugal wheels, and frequencies of leakages from the gear stage that are poured out into the chamber between stages. Obtained experimental results confirm this theory and allow better understanding of the flow processes inside the pump...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a reduced scale {{model of a}} {{low-pressure}} stage of a <b>two-stage</b> <b>pump</b> turbine was investigated when it operates in pump mode, which is as a centrifugal pump with vaned diffuser. An instability region was found in its Q-H curve. This instability region, centered into the flow rate interval between 0. 45 to 0. 7 QDes, restricts the stable operating range of the test pump. The object {{of this study was}} to analyze the origins and development of the unsteadiness inner pump during this saddle instability region, and to find the causes of this saddle, which could guide the design, and optimization of the test pump. Experimental and numerical approaches have been adopted to contribute the understanding on the highly complex flow interactions inside the test pump. The analyses pointed out that the instability of Q-H curve during this flow rate interval was mainly affected by the flow field unsteadiness into the diffuser. Severe flow separation occurred into the diffuser, affecting and/or affected by the unsteadiness from the impeller and return channel remarkably. Both at full and part load, due to the U shape stay vanes in the return system, a 3 -dimentional complex flow was found on the suction side of stay vane near the U turn corner. This flow caused a periodic unforced pressure disturbance with frequency St= 0. 6625 in the diffuser. A rotating stall with 5 cells into the diffuser was also highlighted by the experimental analyses and the numerical results validated that this disturbance was mainly due to the unsteady flow patterns in the return channel. With the reduction of flow rate, the location of this unsteadiness in return channel move closer to the outlet of diffuser, and the unsteadiness made the flow separation near the stay vane leading edge on the suction side more severe and it impacted the flow in diffuser flow field in a more severe way. At the same time, two types of unsteadiness were detected in the impeller in the saddle instability region. They were the flow separation with the frequency St= 0. 6625 at the impeller blade suction side and the wake-jet near the trailing edge of impeller blade with the frequency St= 0. 335, respectively. The wake-jet caused a periodic disturbance with a frequency of St= 0. 335 in diffuser as well. The experimental results indicated that it propagate circumferentially with 2 cells. At the beginning of this saddle instability, in diffuser, the intensity of the fluctuations at St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 both increase with the falling flow rate. With the development of these unsteady patterns, they mixed and caused a blockage in the gap between impeller and diffuser. This blockage caused the increase of the amplitude at BPF, which has been detected both by experimental and numerical results. At the same time, the further development of the blockage weakened the intensity of the two disturbances with frequency of St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 in the blockage region. The blockage fully developed near the critical flow rate of 0. 6 QDes. At this condition, the intensity of rotor and stator interaction increased and energy loss also increased which caused the drop of head and mean pressure at the exit of impeller. Furthermore, the disturbance in diffuser which caused by wake-jet of impeller lost the periodic character with frequency of St= 0. 335 at this condition. This is the reason why the non-linear component St= 0. 335 disappeared in diffuser around 0. 6 QDes...|$|E
