5000|$|Murine MDSCs show two {{distinct}} phenotypes which discriminate them into either monocytic MDSCs or granulocytic MDSCs. The {{relationship between these}} two subtypes remains controversial, as they closely resemble monocytes and neutrophils respectively. While monocyte and neutrophil differentiation pathways within the bone marrow are antagonistic and dependent on the relative expression of IRF8 and c/EBP transcription factors (and hence {{there is not a}} direct precursor-progeny link between these two myeloid cell types), this seems not to be the case for MDSCs. Monocytic MDSCs seem to be precursors of granulocytic subsets demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. [...] This differentiation process is accelerated upon <b>tumour</b> <b>infiltration</b> and possibly driven by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.|$|E

40|$|Orbital tumours are rare, {{but they}} have the {{potential}} to debilitate vision and become life threatening. Given the serious consequences, all ophthalmologists should be able to recognize and appropriately triage patients with orbital disease. This issue of Ophthalmology Rounds reviews some of the more important pediatric and adult orbital tumours, and highlights some of the recent orbital disease literature. Orbital lesions may represent primary orbital <b>tumours,</b> <b>infiltrations,</b> metastases, secondary lesions, or inflammations. Primary orbital tumours can arise from blood vessels, lacrimal glands, nerves, fibrous connective tissue, or other orbital structures. Infiltrations may be caused by lymphoma, sarcoid, or leukemia. Metastases to the adult orbit include those from the breast, lung, and prostate. Secondary orbital lesions include extensions of intracranial meningioma and sinus carcinomas that invade the orbit. Inflammation resulting from orbital cellulitis, Graves orbitopathy, and orbital inflammatory syndrome are only mentioned briefly in this issue on orbital tumours.

40|$|In {{the last}} years {{significant}} {{progress has been made}} in the management of patients with pancreatic head cancer. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has been increasing world-wide in recent years, and it is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Surgical resection offers a low success rate but provides the only chance of cure. Surgery ideally includes a radical (R 0) resection and reestablishment of gastrointestinal continuity. A pancreatico-duodenectomy is usually surgical technique and only curative procedure. Contraindications for curative resection are the presence of distant metastases, peritoneal seeding and extension of <b>tumour.</b> <b>Tumour</b> <b>infiltrations</b> into mesenteric and portal vein are relative contraindications. The most important prognostic factors in radical resections has been shown to be surgically negative margins and nodal status. Systemic chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation have all been used either prior to resection (neoadjuvant therapy) or following surgical resection (adjuvant therapy) in an effort to improve the cure rate achieved with surgery alone...|$|R

40|$|Background: Regulatory T cells (Treg) are {{enriched in}} human {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) where they suppress anti-tumour immunity. The chemokine receptor CCR 5 has {{been implicated in}} the recruitment of Treg from blood into CRC and tumour growth is delayed in CCR 5 / mice, associated with reduced <b>tumour</b> Treg <b>infiltration.</b> Methods: Tissue and blood samples were obtained from patients undergoing resection of CRC. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were phenotyped for chemokine receptors using flow cytometry. The presence of tissue chemokines was assessed. Standard chemotaxis and suppression assays were performed {{and the effects of}} CCR 5 blockade were tested in murine tumour models. Results: Functional CCR 5 was highly expressed by human CRC infiltrating Treg and CCR 5 high Treg were more suppressive than their CCR 5 low Treg counterparts. Human CRC-Treg were more proliferative and activated than other T cells suggesting that local proliferation could provide an alternative explanation for the observed tumour Treg enrichment. Pharmacological inhibition of CCR 5 failed to reduce <b>tumour</b> Treg <b>infiltration</b> in murine <b>tumour</b> models although it did result in delayed tumour growth. Conclusions: CCR 5 inhibition does not mediate anti-tumour effects as a consequence of inhibiting Treg recruitment. Other mechanisms must be found to explain this effect. This has important implications for anti-CCR 5 therapy in CRC. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are enriched in CRC relative to other tissue compartments (Loddenkemper et al, 2006; Salama et al, 2009; Sinicrope et al, 2009). Tumour Treg enrichment occurs i...|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground A distal pancreatectomy is generally performed in cases of benign and malignant tumours of the pancreatic body or tail. Today, even advanced <b>tumours</b> with <b>infiltration</b> into neighbouring organs can be resected with good long-term outcome. Increasing numbers of diagnosed cystic lesions of the pancreas are a further reason for the increased need for distal pancreatectomies [1, 2]. Despite low mortality rates in high-volume centres, the morbid-ity of this operation remains high, at up to 64 % [3]. The most common morbidity following a distal pancrea-tectomy is postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Insuffi-cient healing of the resection margin causes leaking of aggressive pancreatic fluid into the abdominal cavity. Pas-sive drainage tubes are routinely placed intra-abdominally in distal pancreatectomies. If any fluid from the abdominal cavity shows elevated levels of amylase on or after the third postoperative day, a POPF has to be assumed ac-cording to the consensus definition [4].

30|$|Neuroblastic tumours {{arise from}} {{cells of the}} {{peripheral}} sympathetic nervous system and are classified as ganglioneuroma (GN), ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB) or neuroblastoma (NB) [1]. Neuroblastoma (NB) constitutes the most common extracranial solid malignancy in children with highly variable biological potential ranging from spontaneous tumour regression to highly aggressive growth and metastatic spread [2 – 4]. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred cross-sectional imaging modality for diagnostic work-up of NB patients, standard MRI techniques are limited to assessing <b>tumour</b> size, <b>infiltration</b> into adjacent anatomical structures and metastatic spread [5]. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) probes into Brownian motion of water molecules in the extracellular space of biological tissues.

40|$|Tumour {{invasion}} is {{a dynamic}} process occurring in three dimensions and involving interactions between both tumour and stromal cells. Experimental analysis of squamous carcinoma cell invasion has often used the organotypic gel culture system, which is generated by plating tumour cells on to a synthetic stroma composed of a collagen gel embedded with fibroblasts. Unfortunately, quantitation of invasion in these organotypic gels has relied largely on subjective pathological opinion, which {{may be influenced by}} different patterns of <b>tumour</b> cell <b>infiltration.</b> Therefore a computer-assisted digital image analysis system that assesses invasion objectively and provides a numerical 'Invasion Index' was developed. The Invasion Index, by combining depth and pattern of invasion in a single value, establishes a quantitative value that allows assessment of the influences of positive and negative regulation of tumour invasion. These data demonstrate that the organotypic gel system is a robust, accurate, and reproducible method for measuring tumour cell invasion.

To investigate this association and the potential of <b>tumour</b> T-cell <b>infiltration</b> as a prognostic and predictive marker, we have conducted the largest study of T cells in breast cancer to date. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four studies totalling 12 439 patients were used for this work. Cytotoxic (CD 8 +) and regulatory (forkhead box protein 3, FOXP 3 +) T cells were quantified using immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC for CD 8 was conducted using available material from all four studies (8978 samples) and for FOXP 3 from three studies (5239 samples) -multiple imputation was used to resolve missing data from the remaining patients. Cox regression was used to test for associations with breast cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: In ER-negative tumours [triple-negative breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) positive) ], presence of CD 8 + T cells within the tumour was associated with a 28 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 16 % to 38 %] reduction in the hazard of breast cancer-specific mortality, and CD 8 + T cells within the stroma with a 21 % (95 % CI 7 % to 33 %) reduction in hazard. In ER-positive HER 2 -positive tumours, CD 8 + T cells within the tumour were associated with a 27 % (95 % CI 4 % to 44 %) reduction in hazard. In ER-negative disease, there was evidence for greater benefit from anthracyclines in the National Epirubicin Adjuvant Trial in patients with CD 8 + tumours [hazard ratio (HR) = 0. 54; 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 79] versus CD 8 -negative tumours (HR = 0. 87; 95 % CI 0. 55 - 1. 38). The difference in effect between these subgroups was significant when limited to cases with complete data (P heterogeneity = 0. 04) and approached significance in imputed data (P heterogeneity = 0. 1). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CD 8 + T cells in breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in the relative risk of death from disease in both the ER-negative [supplementary Figure S 1, available at Annals of Oncology online] and the ER-positive HER 2 -positive subtypes. <b>Tumour</b> lymphocytic <b>infiltration</b> may improve risk stratification in breast cancer patients classified into these subtypes.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{if the number of}} removed lymph nodes in radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy (RHL) influences survival of patients with early stage cervical cancer and to analyze the relation of different factors like patient age, <b>tumour</b> size and <b>infiltration</b> depth with the number of nodes examined in node-negative early stage cervical cancer patients. METHODS: Of consecutive patients, who underwent RHL between January 1984 and April 2005, 331 had negative nodes (group A) without adjuvant therapy and 136 had positive nodes (group B). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to detect statistical significance. Factors associated with excision of nodes were confirmed with linear regression models. RESULTS: The median number of removed nodes was 19 and 18 for group A and group B, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the number of removed nodes and the cancer specific survival (CSS) or disease free survival (DSF) for patients of group A (p= 0. 625 and p= 0. 877, respectively). The number of removed nodes in group B was not significantly associated with the CSS (p= 0. 084) but it was for the DSF (p= 0. 014). Factors like patient age, <b>tumour</b> size and <b>infiltration</b> depth were not associated with the number of nodes. CONCLUSIONS: No relation was found between the number of negative nodes examined after RHL for the treatment of early stage cervical cancer and CSS or DFS.
