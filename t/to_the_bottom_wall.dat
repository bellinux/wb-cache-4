40|$|Granular {{particles}} vibrated in a fluid {{have been}} found to exhibit self-organization with attractive and repulsive interactions between the particles. These interactions have been attributed to the steady streaming flow around oscillating particles. Here we examine the steady streaming flow surrounding a vertically oscillating sphere using three dimensional particle tracking velocimetry. We present measurements of the flow with the sphere far from boundaries, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> of the tank, and near another oscillating sphere. The steady velocity field is found to disagree with available analytic calculations. When the sphere is oscillated near the bottom wall the entire topology of the flow changes, resulting in a larger repulsive region than expected. Previous experiments saw attraction between particles in the region where the flow around a single particle is repulsive. We conclude that advection in the streaming flow due to a single particle cannot explain the observed attractive and repulsive interactions, rather non-linear interactions between the flows around two or more spheres must be responsible.

In both parameter studies we find that droplets grow less than in the reference case. In case (a) this is explained by the larger velocity with which they travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> and in case (b) by the lower rate of condensation of vapor due to the presence of neighboring droplets...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} {{study of}} natural convection in cavity filled with air {{has been carried}} out under large temperature gradient. The flows under study are generated by a heated solid body located close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> in a rectangular cavity with cold vertical walls and insulated horizontal walls. They have been investigated by direct simulations using a two-dimensional finite volume numerical code solving the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations under the low Mach number approximation. This model permits to take into account large temperature variations unlike the classical Boussinesq model which is valid only for small temperature differences. We were particularly interested in the first transitions which occur when the Rayleigh number is increased for flows in cavities of aspect ratio A = 1, 2, 4. Starting from a steady state, the results obtained for A = 1 and A = 4 show that the first transition occurs through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The induced disturbances determined for weakly supercritical regimes indicate the existence of two instability types driven by different physical mechanisms: shear and buoyancy-driven instabilities, according to whether the flow develops in a square or in a tall cavity. For A = 2, the flow undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation leading to an asymmetric steady state which in turn becomes periodic via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation point. In both cases, the flow is found to be strongly deflected towards one vertical wall and instabilities are found to be of shear layers type...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous {{injection}} of nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles {{is a common}} practice in clinical trials of therapeutic agents to target specific cancerous or pathogenic sites. The vascular flow dynamics of nanocarriers (NCs) in human microcapillaries play an impor-tant role in the ultimate efficacy of this drug delivery method. This article reports an ex-perimental study {{of the effect of}} nanoparticle size on their margination and adhesion propensity in microfluidic channels of a half-elliptical cross section. Spherical polysty-rene particles ranging in diameter from 60 to 970 nm were flown in the microchannels and individual particles adhered to either the top or bottom wall of the channel were imaged using fluorescence microscopy. When the number concentration of particles in the flow was kept constant, the percentage of nanoparticles adhered to the top wall increased with decreasing diameter (d), with the number of particles adhered to the top wall following a d 3 trend. When the volume concentration of particles in solution was kept constant, no discernible trend was found. This experimental finding is explained by the competition between the Brownian force promoting margination and repulsive parti-cle–particle electrostatic forces retarding adhesion to the wall. The 970 nm particles were found to adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> much more than to the top wall {{for each of the three}} physiologically relevant shear rates tested, revealing the effect of gravitational force on the large particles. These findings on the flow behavior of spherical nanopar-ticles in artificial microcapillaries provide further insight for the rational design of NCs for targeted cancer therapeutics.

40|$|When a cavitated body {{moves in}} shallow water, both {{flexible}} free surface and rigid <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> will produce great {{influence on the}} cavity pattern and hydrodynamics <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> motion attitude and stability of the body. In this paper, a single-fluid multiphase flow method coupled with a natural cavitation model was employed <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> effects of two kinds of boundaries on the natural cavitating flow around a two-dimensional symmetry wedge in shallow water. Within {{the range of the}} cavitation number for computation (0. 05 ~ 2. 04), the cavity pattern would be divided into three types, namely, stable type, transition type and wake-vortex type. The shape of the free surface is fairly similar <b>to</b> that of <b>the</b> cavity's upper surface with well right-and-left symmetry. However, when the immersion depth and the cavitation number are decreasing, the symmetry of the cavity shape is destroyed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> effects. When <b>the</b> cavitation number is less than about 0. 1, with the immersion depth going down, free surface effects exerts a stronger influence on the drag coefficient of this 2 D wedge, whereas wall effects bring a stronger influence on the lift coefficient...|$|R

Hours and hours afterward, when the same dense, but delicate, margin was dark against the greenish colors opposite the sunset, the search thus begun at sunrise had not come to an end. By successive stages, and to slowly gathering groups of the company, {{it became apparent that}} the most extraordinary of all gaps had appeared in the party; the guests could find no trace of their host anywhere. The servants reported that his bed had been slept in and his skates and his fancy costume were gone, as if he had risen early for the purpose he had himself avowed. But from the top of <b>the</b> house <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> from <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> round <b>the</b> park <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pond in the center, there was no trace of Lord Bulmer, dead or alive. Horne Fisher realized that a chilling premonition had already prevented him from expecting <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> man alive. But his bald brow was wrinkled over an entirely new and unnatural problem, in not finding the man at all.|$|R
40|$|Taking {{into account}} the easy excitation, {{oscillation}} of electric type are of main practical interest, when there is on- ly one component of electric field, namely the one oriented perpendicularly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top and <b>bottom</b> <b>walls</b> of cavity which does not experience variations along the axis. The frequency spectrum of the oscillation of the magnetron with a nominal frequency of 2. 45 GHz, used in domestic microwave ovens is shown. It is evident that a certain fraction of the energy is released {{in the side of}} the frequency spectrum and can be a source of excitation of the corresponding vibration of higher orders. For a quantitative descriptions of the heat distribution in the warming volume statistical criteria are used, in particu- lar, the standard deviation of the power dissipation value, normalized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> average value. The solution of the problem of the field in the radial sectorial resonator with perfectly conducting walls is obtained. Some of its applications are consid- ered. The analysis of the possibility of using sectorial resonators in microwave devices division / capacity addition is car- ried out.
