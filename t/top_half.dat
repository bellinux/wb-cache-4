5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} {{cross-country}} skiing in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1980 to 1998, and since 2006. The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied {{the last two}} places, and before 1984, no Australian finished above the bottom 15% of racers. Results have slowly improved, but most Australian entrants {{in the last two}} decades have placed in the bottom 25%. In 1992, Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the <b>top</b> <b>half,</b> finishing in the top 40 in two events. Australia fielded three competitors in cross-country skiing in 2006, its largest contingent in the event. Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in the sprint; Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30km freestyle, but competed only in the former due to illness. Nobody broke into the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> in their respective races. At the 2010 Games, Australia had three representatives. Ben Sim came in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> in one event, but he, Bottomley and Murray finished in the bottom 20% in their remaining four events. Australia has never competed in ski jumping, and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960, who came last.|$|E
5|$|Colin Coates {{participated in}} six Winter Olympics, from 1968 to 1988, and came {{sixth in the}} 10,000m event in 1976, Australia's best result before Lillehammer. His four top-11 {{finishes}} in 1976 made him only the third Australian to place in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of a Winter Olympic event. Before the 1988 Olympics, three other athletes had represented Australia in long track racing, and all had placed near the bottom. In 1988, Danny Kah and Michael Richmond both broke into the top 15 and the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> in two events each, and in 1994, the former recorded Australia's best long track result, finishing fifth in the 5,000m event. However, Australia did not compete in long track again until 2010, when sole representative Sophie Muir {{became the first woman}} to compete for the country in the discipline; she came in the bottom fifth of entrants in both her races.|$|E

5|$|Ski cross was {{introduced}} in 2010. Scott Kneller reached the semifinals and placed seventh in the male competition, while Jenny Owens and Katya Cremer came 13th and 15th, all in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E

Rapid increases in participation during this period were primarily due to geographic expansion.|$|R

Mkhedruli (modern Georgian) occupies the U+10D0–U+10FF range (shown in {{the bottom half of}} the first table below) and Asomtavruli occupies the U+10A0–U+10CF range (shown in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the same table). The second block is the Georgian Supplement (U+2D00–U+2D2F), and it contains Nuskhuri.|$|E
5|$|Having {{finished}} in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the 2011–12 Scottish Premier League, Hearts {{were involved in the}} battle to qualify for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League competition. A victory against St Johnstone in their penultimate league match lifted Hearts into fifth place, a qualifying position. Hearts then rested some players for their final league match, a 5–0 defeat by Celtic. Entering the week before the cup final, Hearts had concerns about the fitness of striker Craig Beattie, who was unable to train due to a hamstring injury.|$|E
50|$|The {{training}} outfits used by {{the main}} characters are similar to tankinis, but with the <b>top</b> <b>half's</b> bottom ending very high. Their flight uniforms are skin-tight, and the small interiors of their R.A.s make for close-up scenes, sometimes at immodest angles. Their standard uniforms are more modest from the waist up, but feature high miniskirts and high stockings. Misaki appears in a full-frontal nudity scene {{very early in the}} series, but without any primary sexual characteristics drawn. Scenes in her quarters also sometimes tend to have her in various states of undress.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes {{placed in the}} <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of their events before 1976, while the vast {{majority}} placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, {{as well as the}} lack of support for the athletes—sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile.|$|E
5|$|Napoli {{entered the}} Serie A era under the {{management}} of William Garbutt. During Garbutt's six-year stint, the club would be dramatically transformed, frequently finishing in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the table. This included two third-place finishes during the 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons, with added notables such as Antonio Vojak, Arnaldo Sentimenti and Carlo Buscaglia. However, in the {{years leading up to}} World War II, Napoli went into decline, only surviving relegation in 1939–40 by goal average.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, Hamels was {{suspended}} for five games after hitting Bryce Harper in his lower back with a pitch, after admitting that it was intentional. On July 21, 2012, Hamels hit his first career home run off San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain, who had homered off {{of him in the}} <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the same inning, the first time in MLB that two pitchers had hit home runs off of each other in the same inning.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France {{was viewed}} as the {{potential}} {{start of a new}} era in Australian winter sports, with hopes that a maiden medal would result. Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but crashed in the semi-finals. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing and knocked over teammate John Kah during a changeover; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final. In the individual speed skating events, Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts, with none higher than 12th, and only one placing in the <b>top</b> <b>half.</b> Kirstie Marshall {{was in the process of}} winning the 1992 World Cup series, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, which was a demonstration event, but she crash-landed and finished seventh. Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events, and finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the competitors in four events; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events. Despite the disappointments of the near-misses, Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics, purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993.|$|E
5|$|After {{growing up}} in Toxteth, Liverpool, Nolan signed for Bolton Wanderers {{at the age of}} 16. Part of the team that beat Preston North End in the 2001 First Division play-offs to gain {{promotion}} to the Premier League, he soon became a regular first-team player for the club. He scored as Bolton beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in both of his first two seasons in the top tier of English football, as well as important goals that helped Bolton regularly finish in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the Premier League table.|$|E
5|$|Australia first {{competed in}} figure skating in 1952, and has competed in 1956, 1960 and every Olympics since 1980. In earlier years, Australia earned some last places or near-misses. Until 1988, no Australian had placed above the 20th percentile, but results have slowly improved; Anthony Liu {{finished}} 10th out of 28 {{competitors in the}} men's event in 2002. Joanne Carter represented Australia in 1998 & 2006. She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the field. In 2010, Australia's lone participant Cheltzie Lee came 20th. Australia has competed in ice dancing only twice—in 1988 and 2014—when their solitary representative in both the men and women's individual event came last.|$|E

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964. Australia's Winter Olympic inaugural {{participant}} was long track speed skater Kenneth Kennedy, who competed in 1936 {{and placed in the}} bottom 25% in all of his four events. Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later. Until 1968, Hickey's four aforementioned results were the only times that an Australian finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of their event.|$|E
5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} four seasons Palace achieved respectable <b>top</b> <b>half</b> finishes, and poached the Bury manager Bert Head after persistence from chairman Arthur Wait in early 1966. Head had been with Bury less than a season. The new manager promoted from the youth team and transferred in players new and old, and delighted fans by re-signing Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968–69 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates {{at the beginning of}} the season, finished second behind Derby County who were managed by Brian Clough. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.|$|E
