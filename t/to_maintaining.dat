If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity is the key <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> {{the highest levels of}} hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Official {{religion}} {{involved a}} variety of rituals, based in temples. Some rites were performed every day, whereas others were festivals, taking place at longer intervals and often limited to a particular temple or deity. The gods received their offerings in daily ceremonies, in which their statues were clothed, anointed, and presented with food as hymns were recited in their honor. These offerings, in addition <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> maat for the gods, celebrated deities' life-giving generosity and encouraged them to remain benevolent rather than vengeful.|$|E

5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E

Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> them for the duration of the hostilities.

5|$|From {{the early}} 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added {{programs}} and staff that continued {{the transformation of}} the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from MIT and started the first pathogen-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956. Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. donated $15million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities devoted <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> a strong system of academic research and education.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England from William Rufus, giving him a claim of suzerainty over Wales and Scotland, and acquired the Duchy of Normandy, a complex entity with troubled borders. The borders between England and Scotland were still uncertain during Henry's reign, with Anglo-Norman influence pushing northwards through Cumbria, but Henry's relationship with King David I of Scotland was generally good, partially due to Henry's marriage to his sister. In Wales, Henry used his power to coerce and charm the indigenous Welsh princes, while Norman Marcher Lords pushed across the valleys of South Wales. Normandy was controlled via various interlocking networks of ducal, ecclesiastical and family contacts, backed by a growing string of important ducal castles along the borders. Alliances and relationships with neighbouring counties along the Norman border were particularly important <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> {{the stability of the}} Duchy.|$|E

5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} {{as the key}} <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to {{increase the size of}} the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E

40|$|Schizophrenia {{can be a}} very {{disabling}} {{illness that}} affects between 0. 5 % and 1 % of the population. This illness has a great personal impact on the individual sufferer, their family and friends. In addition, it makes significant demands on health services and the community in general. This paper reviews the literature on hosing and supportive relationships for people with schizophrenia. The literature reports that people's experience of their schizophrenia is that it not only causes symptoms, but often impacts on their ability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the basic resources in life. These resources include theability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> reasonable quality housing, which seems to further impact negatively on their illness and their ability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> supportive social relationships. People with schizophrenia (and people in general) rely on their social relationships and family <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> their mental health. The loss of social relationships and inability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> quality housing seem to be related - if people cannot maintain quality housing, they find it difficult <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> supportive social relationships.

5|$|On January 1, 1809, Martín de Álzaga rallied most peninsular battalions to Plaza de Mayo and {{attempted}} a mutiny against Liniers. A few criollos, such as Mariano Moreno, laid their hopes for independence in this attempt, but most did not. The battalions still faithful to Liniers – the Regiment of Patricians, the other criollo battalions, {{and the remaining}} peninsular ones – conquered the Plaza and ordered the mutinying forces to withdraw. Castelli supported Liniers, accusing Álzaga of independentism. Though Castelli was himself an independentist, and had also sought to remove Liniers, he opposed Álzaga for other reasons: Álzaga was hoping <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> the social dominance of the peninsulares over the criollos once the viceroy, who opposed his interests, was deposed. Álzaga was defeated, {{and the power of}} the criollos was increased: Sentenach and Álzaga were banished to Carmen de Patagones and the Spanish militias who attempted the coup were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E
