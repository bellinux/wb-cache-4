500|$|The FairTax's {{effect on}} the {{distribution}} of taxation or <b>tax</b> <b>incidence</b> (the {{effect on the}} distribution of economic welfare) is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base, that it would be progressive, and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth (reducing the economic gap). Opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. A person earning $2 million a year could live well spending $1 million, and as a result pay a mere 11% of that year's income in taxes. Households {{at the lower end of}} the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving. [...] Therefore, according to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).|$|E
500|$|Edgeworth devoted {{considerable}} {{effort to}} insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all {{schools of thought}} in economics.

[...] The articles focused on a back and forth over <b>tax</b> <b>incidence</b> and responses by producers. [...] Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied. [...] Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous. [...] Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation. [...] He suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions. [...] Harold Hotelling later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a [...] "diminution of price {{as a result of the}} tax") could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate.|$|E

40|$|Fuel {{taxation}} {{is often}} viewed as unfavorable instrument compared to traffic restrictions.

The thesis finds that the tax concession effect is not benign. Instead, the tax concessions exhibit behaviours that are akin to a discrete, unpriced risk factor in the long-run returns on compulsory superannuation savings and investment. The outcome is that the higher income earners receive a greater benefit from the superannuation tax concessions than lower income earners.

40|$|Summary. The {{idea that}} the final {{distribution}} of the <b>tax</b> burden (economic <b>incidence)</b> {{does not depend on}} the initial distribution of <b>tax</b> liabilities (statutory <b>incidence)</b> {{is referred to as the}} Liability Side Equivalence principle. This paper tests this principle in the laboratory and finds that subjects who actually have to pay the tax carry a higher tax burden. It is argued that this violation of Liability Side Equivalence is due to the fact that a change in the distribution of tax liabilities induces a shift in behaviorally relevant social norms. This shift, in turn, affects the impact of the tax. Our results explain some striking empirical observations and have important theoretical and practical implications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} equity {{implications}} of indirect or consumption taxes from a gender perspective, using detailed expenditure data for South Africa. While a growing {{literature on the}} <b>incidence</b> of indirect <b>taxes</b> investigates {{their impact on the}} income distribution in developing countries, there is little work on whether indirect taxes have differential gender outcomes. Gender bias is likely to exist in taxes that are levied on consumption expenditure, because men and women (and their households) spend their incomes on different types of goods, or on goods that are taxed differently. To estimate the gender <b>incidence</b> of indirect <b>taxes,</b> this study explores differences between households that are classified as more ‘female’ or more ‘male’ according to their demographic and economic attributes. The results suggest that the zero-rating of a selection of basic foodstuffs and fuel for household use is important in protecting ‘female-type’ households, especially those in the lowest expenditure quintiles and with children, from bearing an otherwise disproportionate share of the burden of these taxes. In contrast, high taxes on alcohol, tobacco and fuel for private transport result in a higher incidence on ‘male-type’ households, those in the middle and top quintiles and those without children. The paper also suggests ways in which the indirect tax system could be refined to further reduce the large gender (and income) inequities that exist in South Africa. indirect <b>taxes,</b> <b>incidence,</b> gender equity, South Africa...|$|R

5000|$|In economics, <b>tax</b> <b>incidence</b> or {{tax burden}} is the {{analysis}} of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare. The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product, which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers. The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats, in particular François Quesnay, who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent. <b>Tax</b> <b>incidence</b> is said to [...] "fall" [...] upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of, or ultimately has to pay, the tax.
