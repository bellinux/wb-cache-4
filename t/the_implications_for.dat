5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> their behavior. Since stress fractures {{are caused by}} repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey.|$|E

5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that would place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E

25|$|Music {{has been}} shown to {{consistently}} elicit emotional responses in its listeners, and this relationship between human affect and music has been studied in depth. This includes isolating which specific features of a musical work or performance convey or elicit certain reactions, the nature of the reactions themselves, and how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as philosophy, musicology, and aesthetics, as well the acts of musical composition and performance. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> casual listeners are also great; research has shown that the pleasurable feelings associated with emotional music are the result of dopamine release in the striatum—the same anatomical areas that underpin the anticipatory and rewarding aspects of drug addiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its dozens of minigames and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there, as did several other originally console RPGs, blurring the line between the console and computer platforms.|$|E
25|$|This {{classification}} {{refers to}} the position of the N- and C-terminal domains. Types I, II, and III are single-pass molecules, while type IV are multiple-pass molecules. Type I transmembrane proteins are anchored to the lipid membrane with a stop-transfer anchor sequence and have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen during synthesis (and the extracellular space, if mature forms are located on plasmalemma). Type II and III are anchored with a signal-anchor sequence, with type II being targeted to the ER lumen with its C-terminal domain, while type III have their N-terminal domains targeted to the ER lumen. Type IV is subdivided into IV-A, with their N-terminal domains targeted to the cytosol and IV-B, with an N-terminal domain targeted to the lumen. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> the division in the four types are especially manifest at the time of translocation and ER-bound translation, when the protein has to be passed through the ER membrane in a direction dependent on the type.|$|E
