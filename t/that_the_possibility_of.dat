5|$|The {{high energy}} content of 178m2Hf was {{the concern of}} a DARPA-funded program in the US. This program {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> using a nuclear isomer of hafnium (the above-mentioned 178m2Hf) to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of induced gamma emission—was infeasible because of its expense.

5|$|Race {{officials}} {{expected a}} record turnout {{in the days}} leading up to the Preakness, estimating over 50,000 people. They hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> Secretariat completing the Triple Crown and Sham attempting to foil Secretariat's run would lead to an increase in attendance. The official attendance for the event was reported at 61,657, which surpassed the previous record of 48,721 people set in 1972. The new record lasted until 1975 when 75,216 spectators were present at Pimlico.|$|E
5|$|S. C. Hawkes {{argues that}} the eight items in the hoard were found in {{different}} graves, basing this on x-ray and fluorescent analysis of the coins. However, the historian Philip Grierson thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> two graves from different time periods both containing coins of the same period was so small as to make {{the likelihood of the}} hoard coming from two graves slim.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after his spell at Inverness ended, Davis joined League One side Chesterfield on loan for three months. He was ever-present over nine league matches and also played twice in the Football League Trophy, a cup {{competition}} open to teams from {{the third and fourth}} tiers of the Football League; a 3–1 aggregate win against Oldham Athletic in the Northern Final earned Chesterfield a place in the final itself. On 6 March, he was recalled by Wolves' new manager, Terry Connor, after an injury to Karl Henry left Wolves in need of midfield cover. Davis himself felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> playing Premier League football for Wolves far outweighed the prospect of a Wembley final.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|In September rumours {{were already}} {{circulating}} among the evacuees, and in Gibraltar, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, {{this time the}} destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies. After much contention, {{it was decided to}} send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 evacuees left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.|$|E

5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomy}} {{question remains}} on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations {{as part of the}} Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In the 1960s, Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked his Albanian counterpart about giving autonomy to the Greek minority, with no results. In 1991, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization Omonoia called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.|$|E

25|$|ORS may be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. About 13% of schizophrenics have {{olfactory}} hallucinations. Generally, schizophrenic hallucinations {{are perceived}} as having an imposed, external origin, while in ORS they are recognized as originating from the individual. The suggested diagnostic criteria mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> ORS is negated by a diagnosis of schizophrenia in which persistent delusions of an offensive body odor and olfactory hallucinations are contributing features for criterion A. However, some reported ORS cases were presented as co-morbid. Indeed, {{some have suggested that}} ORS may in time transform into schizophrenia, but others state there is little evidence for this. Persons with ORS have none of the other criteria to qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.|$|E

In January 2017, it was announced that the 2017 Shoreham Airshow would not take place. Doubt was expressed about an airshow taking place at Shoreham in 2018. The 2016 Llandudno Airshow was cancelled, {{due to a lack of}} time to make changes in light of new regulations introduced by the CAA. The organisers intend that the 2017 airshow will go ahead. For the 2016 Farnborough Airshow, the Red Arrows performed a flypast rather than an aerobatic display, stating that the latter would not be appropriate in the aftermath of the Shoreham accident.|$|E
25|$|In January 1975, just a {{few months}} after his {{marriage}} to Zanele, Mbeki was sent to Swaziland to assess the possibility of setting up an ANC frontline base in the country. Ostensibly attending a UN conference, Mbeki was accompanied by Max Sisulu. The duo met with Sisulu's sister, Lindiwe Sisulu, who was studying at the University at Swaziland. Lindiwe set up a meeting for the two at the home of S'bu Ndebele, then a librarian at the university. Mbeki and Sisulu held meetings in Swaziland for a week with South Africans studying there to assess the situation. They returned to Lusaka after a week, when their visas had expired. Mbeki reported back to the ANC <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> establishing an ANC base in Swaziland was promising, especially because of its location, as it was close to Johannesburg and Durban.|$|E
