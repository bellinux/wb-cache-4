25|$|Guernica {{quickly became}} a world-renowned symbol of {{civilian}} suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into Guernica. The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso never cared much for anything <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his commissioned work for Spain into a reflection on the massacre.|$|E

[...] He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: [...] "The Basement Tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are {{no more likely to}} fade than Elvis Presley's 'Mystery Train' or Robert Johnson's 'Love In Vain." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> really big visual pictures. But I wanted to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E

2500|$|According to a legal {{analysis}} by former Supreme Court President Vilma Morales, Zelaya automatically ceased being President of Honduras {{with the publication}} of decree PCM-020-2009 and thus no coup d'état existed. However, PCM-027-2009 was never processed by the Honduran courts. This new decree published in La Gaceta 26 June 2009 explained further the purpose, form and objectives of the opinion poll, to be carried out by the National Institute of Statistics. But the courts had already made up their minds about every attempt <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> this issue. Zelaya's lawyers were also denied the possibility to participate in the process. PCM-027-2009 was sheltered in article 5 of the [...] "Law of Citizen Participation" [...] and articles 2 and 5 of the Honduran Constitution. Zelaya defined his actions as a non-binding opinion poll, but his political opponents presented his actions as a binding referendum oriented at reforming articles in the Honduran Constitution concerning forms of government and re-election.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1991, Foster {{released}} her first feature {{film as a}} director, Little Man Tate, a drama about a child prodigy who struggles {{to come to terms}} with being different. The main role was played by previously unknown actor Adam Hann-Byrd, and Foster co-starred as his working-class single mother. She had found the script from the [...] "slush pile" [...] at Orion Pictures, and explained that for her debut film she [...] "wanted a piece that was not autobiographical, but <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the 10 philosophies I've accumulated in the past 25 years. Every single one of them, if they weren't in the script from the beginning, they're there now." [...] Although she was publicly lauded for her choice to become a director, many reviewers felt that the film itself did not live up to the high expectations, and regarded it as [...] "less adventurous than many films in which [...] had starred". Regardless, it was a moderate box office success. Foster's final film appearance of the year came in a small role as a prostitute in Shadows and Fog (1991), directed by Woody Allen, with whom she had wanted to collaborate since the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} is to explore the role pivotal states play as {{security}} providers and what impact they have in particular on regional security governance.

Given the growing interaction between national and regional actors in the decision making of regional security governance, a state-centric approach is insufficient as a framework of analysis. Security governance covers threats <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with potential or actual violence: terrorism, war and counter insurgency, ethnic cleansing, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, massive human rights violence, and organised crime, as well as issues <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with natural disasters: famines, pandemics, cyber warfare, and even financial crises...|$|R
