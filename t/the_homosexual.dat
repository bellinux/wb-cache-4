5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio's first {{effort of}} 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, {{and as a}} result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself. The film was {{released}} to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.|$|E

It was the former's final film role, as he died during the postproduction after suffering from tuberculosis. Siddharth Menon and Rishabh Chaddha play supporting roles in the film.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Homosexual</b> Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, Lesbos, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and <b>the</b> <b>Homosexual.</b> Police stood outside with large floodlights, and {{in an effort to}} intimidate took {{photographs}} of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
5|$|Some {{continue}} to play off <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. Another happened {{in the summer of}} 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that <b>The</b> <b>Homosexual</b> Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|Williams gained public {{recognition}} for Brokeback Mountain, a film directed by Ang Lee that depicts <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> relationship between Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal). Williams plays Ennis' wife Alma, who {{becomes aware of}} {{the true nature of}} his and Jack's relationship when she sees them in an embrace. After viewing The Station Agent, casting director Avy Kaufman suggested to Lee that he cast Williams as Alma. The film was a box office hit, grossing around $178million worldwide in ticket sales against its $14million production costs. The film received eight Oscar nominations, the most for any film that year, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Williams, and it won three accolades at the 78th Academy Awards. The saffron Vera Wang dress, which she wore to the Academy Awards in March 2006, has been cited by Cosmopolitan magazine as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time.|$|E
5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> community, this actually portrayed oppression and the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling {{she would not be}} able to do it justice. Six months later, she agreed to appear in the film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as <b>the</b> <b>homosexual</b> designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
