5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, {{mainly because of the}} vigorous methods he used <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{a revolt}} against Angevin rule, {{known as the}} Sicilian Vespers, threw off Charles of Anjou's rule of the island of Sicily. The Angevins managed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> in the {{mainland}} part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled Kingdom of Sicily, although it is {{commonly referred to as}} the Kingdom of Naples, after its capital. The island became a separate kingdom under the Crown of Aragon.|$|E
5|$|In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab {{attacked}} Enna, but {{was defeated}} by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. The Muslims responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which they placed under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers discovered an unguarded path leading to the town, allowing the Muslims to take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> of the citadel, and after negotiations secured a Muslim withdrawal {{in exchange for a}} large ransom.|$|E

5000|$|Evidently {{acknowledging}} {{the limits on}} their ability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> tight <b>control</b> over {{an industry that has}} been expanding rapidly, party leaders during the last decade have publicly addressed the need to establish priorities. In particular, they have spoken of the high priority attached <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>control</b> over the [...] "big media"—national party papers and central and provincial TV and radio stations.|$|R
5000|$|This {{notion is}} closely related <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>control</b> of the center squares in the {{strategic}} game chess.

5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> {{and improve}} administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between {{individuals}} were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.|$|E
5|$|Army Group North {{had already}} {{considered}} abandoning Estonia in February 1944, during the Soviet Kingisepp-Gdov Offensive. A {{large number of}} units would have been freed up with changes to the front, but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler's orders. The German Command considered it important <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland and keep the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf. The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was important for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|Attacks of the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} the Army Group North {{to the west}} of Lake Peipus {{resulting}} in a series of operations around Narva. The German Command considered it important <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, which eased the situation in Finland and kept the Soviet Baltic Fleet in its eastern bay. From a military economy viewpoint, the preservation of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was also important. In the south, Soviet forces advanced towards the Baltic seacoast {{at the end of their}} Operation Bagration of June–August 1944 against the German Army Group Centre.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
5|$|In January 1961, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of decolonisation, the island's British {{authorities}} drew up constituencies and held democratic elections. Both the ASP and the ZNP won 11 of the available 22 seats in Zanzibar's Parliament, so further elections were held in June with the number of seats increased to 23. The ZNP entered into a coalition with the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) and this time took 13 seats, while the ASP, despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by the ASP and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. <b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control,</b> the coalition government banned the more radical opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E

50|$|Hooks {{are very}} {{important}} tools in the arsenal of a grappler. The effective use of the feet to manipulate {{the position of the}} opponent is essential <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>control</b> of one's opponent. Both in offensive and defensive situations, locking in hooks gives an advantage of more points of contact with the opponent. This in turn increases the ability to impose submissions, and the ability to avoid them.|$|R

5|$|Learning {{from his}} father, Favre became fluent in the {{languages}} of French, English, Spanish, and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw. The lands along the Gulf coast were held by the British {{for nearly two decades}} following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, but their ability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> diminished during that time. On September 3, 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles. Favre's father had just died the year before this treaty, and Simon Favre followed his father's career, also inheriting his father's plantation on the Pearl River, though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. <b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 novel , {{published}} by HarperEntertainment as a tie-innovelization, expanded on the backstories of Passions prominent characters, {{such as the}} romantic relationship between Eve Russell and Julian Crane {{and the fate of}} their child. Promoted as being written by the witch Tabitha Lenox and her living doll sidekick Timmy Lenox, the book was in reality composed by Reilly in collaboration with writer Alice Alfonsi. According to the novel, Vincent was born on Christmas day. Alistair Crane arranges for Vincent to be killed, but the hitman places the baby into social services without his knowledge. In the series, Alistair does not order for Vincent's death, and instead kidnaps him as an infant to abuse him and turn him into a tool for his schemes <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> over the fictional town of Harmony.|$|E

5|$|The {{seizure of}} {{territory}} within South Vietnam itself allowed Hanoi {{to extend the}} trail across the border with Laos and into that country. The signing of the Paris Peace Accords seemed to bring the conflict in Southeast Asia to an end. The last U.S. forces departed in March 1973. Both North and South Vietnamese were <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> in the areas under their influence and negotiations between the two nations, possibly leading to a coalition government and unification, were to take place. Jockying for control of more territory, both sides flagrantly violated the cease-fire and open hostilities began anew.|$|E
5|$|They {{concluded}} that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged geographic location {{at the crossroads of}} three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration was incapable of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E

5|$|Turner and Meyszner clashed {{continually}} throughout 1942, as Meyszner {{sought to}} remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including {{the supervision of the}} security forces of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought hard <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> over these areas. Meyszner believed the only way to maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one, akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, with himself as Reichskommissar (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. However, Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the Wehrmacht, which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England, William the Conqueror {{established}} a motte-and-bailey castle at Warwick in 1068 <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>control</b> of the Midlands as he advanced northwards. Building a castle in a pre-existing settlement could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In {{the case of}} Warwick, the least recorded of the 11urban castles in the 1086 survey, four houses were torn down {{to make way for}} the castle. A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound– on which usually stands a keep or tower– and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed Henry de Beaumont, the son of a powerful Norman family, as constable of the castle. In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first Earl of Warwick. He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the Bishop of Worcester, believing that a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127–28.|$|E
