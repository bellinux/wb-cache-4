25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rate {{the relationship between the}} identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely to}} perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, {{the study}} The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2011) {{indicated}} that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings [...] {{based on how}} much they liked the name {{and how much they}} liked painting. To give meaning to the decisions, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> select names that they might give to their children. For rating the paintings, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> base their ratings on whether or not they would display such art at home.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to read {{a series}} of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first {{component}} of the task, known as the word-reading condition of <b>the</b> task, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> {{to read a}}s quickly as possible a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then <b>asked</b> to name the color of a series of colored blocks.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> non-personally {{identifiable}} information including age; their gender; {{whether they}} live alone {{and if they}} live alone.

3000|$|... “Critique phase”: <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to {{identify}} and investigate the main problem that they wish to focus on, seeking to analyze it thoroughly and understand various aspects of it.|$|R
30|$|Before {{starting}} <b>the</b> experiment, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> {{to complete}} a brief questionnaire, e.g., age, music preference, etc. After completing the questionnaire the experiment started with the assignment explained in the instructions.|$|R
30|$|Make International Call: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to dial {{a long-distance}} {{telephone}} number {{and leave a}} message provided by the experimenter. Dialing a long-distance call may have a high cost associated with it compared to making a local call, which allowed us to explore participant opinions on financial risks. This task also allowed another speaker verification match or non-match, much like as described for the Make Local Call task. Change Device PIN: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to change <b>the</b> device PIN. This task was included to assess how <b>participants</b> perceive <b>the</b> value of the PIN mechanism and the security it provides.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, in Washing Away Your Sins: Threatened Morality and Physical Cleansing (2006), {{the results}} {{indicated}} that a person washing his or her hands is an action that helps resolve post-decisional cognitive dissonance, because the mental stress usually was caused by the person's ethical-moral self-disgust, which is an emotion related to the physical disgust caused by a dirty environment. Likewise, the study The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2011) indicated that participants rated 80 names and 80 paintings based on how much they liked the name and how much they liked painting. To give meaning to the decisions, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> select names that they might give to their children.

50|$|Solomon E. Asch {{conducted}} {{a modification of}} Sherif’s study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group {{to a series of}} lines, and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.|$|E
50|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983), participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> make an evaluation of logical validity. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} a concurrent physical therapy activity (keeping the hand open) during delays to reinforcement in an adult man with acquired brain injuries. Once a relatively stable level of hand-open behavior <b>was</b> obtained, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to choose between a small immediate reinforcer and a larger delayed reinforcer contingent on keeping the hand open at greater-than-baseline duration. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to select between a larger delayed reinforcer with no hand-open requirement and the identical larger delayed reinforcer with a progressively increasing hand-open requirement. Results suggest a shift in preference to larger delayed reinforcers and an eventual preference for the hand-open requirement option...|$|R
50|$|Each word {{is placed}} on a {{separate}} card. After viewing a design or product <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> {{to pick out the}} words they feel are relevant.

50|$|The 2013 {{event was}} a month-long BBC series {{that took place}} in October. The series {{examined}} {{the role of women in}} the 21st century and culminated in an event held at BBC Broadcasting House in London, United Kingdom on 25 October 2013 involving a hundred women from around the world, all of whom came from different walks of life. The day featured debate and discussion on radio, television and online, in which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> give their opinions about the issues facing women.|$|E
50|$|Context {{effects are}} not {{explained}} by bottom-up theories of accounting. Irving Biederman performed experiments that demonstrated dramatic context effects. For example, Stephen Palmer carried out {{an experiment in}} which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> identify objects after they were shown either a relevant or irrelevant context. They might be shown a scene of a baseball game, followed by images of a baseball, car, and a phone. The stimuli that was most relevant to the context, the baseball, was recognized quicker than those that were irrelevant, car and phone.|$|E
5000|$|Helmreich and Collins {{conducted}} an experiment entitled [...] "Studies in Forced Compliance: Commitment and Magnitude of Inducement to Comply as Determinants of Opinion Change". This {{study consisted of}} sixty-sixty male college students who were asked to record a counter-attitudinal statement concerning a serious issue. Variables included multiple levels of commitment. These levels included making an anonymous audio recording, a non-anonymous video recording, and a non-anonymous video recording with no chance to withdraw their statement. Half of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> make the recording, while the other half was asked to make the counter statement.|$|E
50|$|During a whispered speech test, <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> {{to cover}} <b>the</b> opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> and say {{a series of}} words in a soft whisper. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then <b>asked</b> to repeat what <b>is</b> heard. If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to {{distinguish}} the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R
30|$|Lower body muscular {{endurance}} {{was measured}} using a 1 -minute sit-stand test. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to perform as many sit-stand movements as possible in 1  minute.

30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> “Do {{you think}} the SSM has {{affected}} {{the popularity of the}} Yemeni Unification, about 53.3 % <b>participants</b> agreed that <b>the</b> southern issue has affected negatively the popularity of the Yemeni national unity while 30 % “strongly agree”.|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} studies, {{researchers}} investigated how stereotypes affected police officers' {{decisions to}} shoot. They used a video game and exposed their participants to pictures of either Whites or Non-Whites who were armed or unarmed. During this video game, <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> choose between [...] "shoot" [...] or [...] "don't shoot" [...] as quickly as possible. The results were that the participants shot armed black people faster than armed white people and chose [...] "don't shoot" [...] faster for unarmed white than unarmed black persons.|$|E
5000|$|Session one: In this session, smokers {{were asked}} to only imagine {{themselves}} in pain. This was to encourage the participants to stimulate themselves with thoughts irrelevant to smoking. This lead the experimenters {{to see if the}} participants were at either hot or cold stage of empathy gap. After the experimenters discovered the stage of the participants, experimenters did another experiment. The participants in the cold state were categorized in the controlled cue and {{were asked to}} remove a plastic cover of a tray after 20 seconds of the exposure of the plastic cover. Underneath was a tape roll. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> stare at the tape roll and then were surveyed. The participants in the hot state were categorized in the smoking cue. They were asked to do similar ritual of removing the plastic cover but the only difference was underneath the plastic cover was a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and an ashtray. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> pick up a cigarette, light it with the lighter and stare at it without smoking it and were later surveyed. Then they (both controlled and smoker participants) are asked the minimum amount of money needed to delay smoking. Both hot and cold staged participants are asked to state the minimum price amount they need to delay smoking [...] "right now".|$|E
5000|$|In India {{competition}} for all enthusiastic entrepreneurs, {{individuals and organizations}} running energy access programmes and businesses in rural villages in India has also been launched {{and is about to}} close in November-2015. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> highlight close sustainable examples where off-grid system is being practiced providing a platform for [...] "energy entrepreneurs" [...] to discuss the ways for achieving off-grid systems. This competition has also good rewards for successful winners i.e. Cash Prize of I million Indian Rupees, a trip to world Sustainable Development Forum to showcase their business on the main stage, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Mental Reinstatement of Environmental and Personal Contexts: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to mentally {{revisit the}} to-be-remembered (TBR) event. The {{interviewer}} may {{ask them to}} form a mental picture of {{the environment in which}} they witnessed the event. This picture could include the placement of objects such as windows or furniture, the lighting, or even <b>the</b> temperature. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> also <b>asked</b> to revisit their personal mental state during the event and then describe it in detail. The purpose of this process is to increase the feature overlap between initial witnessing and subsequent retrieval contexts.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>participant</b> guide {{included}} instructions, booklets of worksheets that <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> {{used during}} <b>the</b> experiment. One of these worksheets is entitled “The NoSQL solution” (e.g. the proposed HBase schema) where <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> {{to draw a}} representation of his proposed HBase schema (i.e. the target schema) for the conversion.|$|R
30|$|Self-assessment stress evaluation. It {{was carried}} out {{immediately}} after each scenario, while viewing back-recorded video sequences. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> to quantify his stress level from 0 to 100 using a haptic 3 D wheel navigator (3 Dconnexion Space Navigator) and a proprietary software (Autoconfrontation V 1.0. 4, BCom, Brest, France).|$|R
50|$|The out-group {{homogeneity}} {{effect is}} the perception that members of an out-group are more similar (homogenous) than members of the in-group. Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools Princeton University and Rutgers University. Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study. Then <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> guess {{what percentage of the}} videotaped students' classmates would choose the same. Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members (the rival school) than between members of their in-group.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that it is possible for minority influence and majority influence to work together. A study by Clark (1994) uses a jury setting from the film 12 Angry Men to investigate social influence. Some of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> just read the arguments from one of the characters (who acted as the minority), while the other group were also told how he changed the opinion {{of the rest of the}} jury. Social influence was present in both groups, but was stronger in the group that was exposed to both the arguments (minority influence) and the knowledge that the jury conformed (majority influence).|$|E
50|$|Müller {{formulated}} {{and tested}} {{the theory of}} retroactive interference. Retroactive Interference is when unrelated material {{makes it difficult to}} learn new material. Müller and his student Pilzecker studied this by presenting participants with a list of syllables for 6 minutes and then presented three landscape paintings and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> describe them. Then the participants were tested on how much they remembered from the list. The control list was presented with no distractions from the landscape paintings and ability to remember what was on the control list was higher than the list paired with the paintings. This supported retroactive interference, the information from the paintings made it more difficult to remember the syllables from the first list.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presentation}} is immediately {{followed by the}} mental arithmetic component, during which <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> to count backwards from 1,022 in steps of 13. If a mistake is made, then they must start again from the beginning. This component lasts for 5 minutes and {{is followed by a}} recovery period.|$|R
5000|$|Reporting the TBR Event from Different Perspectives: <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> {{to report}} <b>the</b> event from several {{different}} perspectives; {{like that of}} another witness or even a <b>participant.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> witnessed a robbery, the interviewer may ask ‘What {{do you think the}} cashier saw?’ and then ask for <b>the</b> <b>participant’s</b> perspective.|$|R
50|$|Hick {{performed}} a second experiment {{using the same}} task, while keeping the number of alternatives at 10. <b>The</b> <b>participant</b> performed <b>the</b> task the first two times with the instruction to perform the task as accurately as possible.
