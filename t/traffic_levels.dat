40|$|A {{diagnostic}} study {{was done on}} Melia azedarach L. in relation to atmospheric pollutants in Córdoba city, Argentina. The study area receives regional pollutants, and it was categorized taking into account <b>traffic</b> <b>level,</b> industrial level, location of the sample point {{in relation to the}} corner, treeless condition, building type, topographic level and distance to the river. Water content and Specific Leaf Area (SLA) were calculated; and concentrations of soluble proteins, sulphur, hydroperoxy conjugated dienes (HPCD), chlorophylls (Total Chl) and pheophytins (Total Paeoph) were determined in leaf samples. HPCD correlated positively with industry, topographic level and distance to the river, and with a combination of the environmental variables (ECI); pigments correlated negatively with <b>traffic</b> <b>level</b> and with ECI; Total Phaeoph/Total Chl ratio correlated positively with traffic, building and ECI. On the basis of our results, <b>traffic</b> <b>level,</b> industrial level, building type, topographic level and distance to the river are the environmental variables to bear in mind when selecting analogous sampling points in a passive monitoring program. An approximation to predict tree injury may be obtained by measuring water content, soluble proteins, sulphur, HPCD and pigments as they are responsible for the major variability of data. This study revealed that M. azedarach was sensitive to air pollutants from traffic and industry. Thus, in those sampling sites with the maximum score for <b>traffic</b> <b>level,</b> industrial level and ECI, the highest values of the parameters that indicate foliar damage together with the least pigment concentration were observed...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{evaluations}} of multi-hop ad hoc network routing protocols have been primarily conducted through analytic and simulation-based studies, which frequently fail to accurately predict real-world performance and behaviour. One {{reason for this}} is the challenge in developing low cost, representative test beds with the degree of flexibility and mobility required. We have developed a Portable Wireless Ad hoc Node (PWAN) device which establishes multi-hop routes using the OLSR routing protocol. The PWAN’s performance has been investigated using two test bed configurations to evaluate its capacity under conditions of high node density in a short-range, multi-hop environment. Our results illustrate that such networks are capable of providing high quality connections when traffic density is low. However, the network link quality deteriorates dramatically as the <b>traffic</b> <b>level</b> increases, and the network topology becomes unstable until the <b>traffic</b> <b>level</b> is reduced...|$|R

5|$|Cleveland Road {{continues}} east running near Ashley {{and into}} Saginaw County. In between Ashley {{and the county}} line, the highway crosses {{a branch of the}} Great Lakes Central Railroad. M-57 follows Brady Road and crosses M-52 just west of Chesaning. Further east, the trunkline crosses another line of the Great Lakes Central. The highway follows Broad Street into town and over the Shiawassee River. On the east banks, M-57 runs along Main Street south along the river to a junction with Peet Road where it then turns east along the latter road out of town. The highway passes through more farm fields and through Layton Corners {{on the way to a}} junction with M-13 on the Saginaw–Genesee county line. At Montrose, M-57 crosses the Flint River, and a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Now running along Vienna Road, the trunkline meets I-75/US23 west of Clio. As it enters town, it crosses a line of the Saginaw Bay Southern Railway. This segment of the highway passes through the northernmost suburbs of Flint, and this section is where the heaviest <b>traffic</b> <b>levels</b> along the whole highway are found. As part of its maintenance duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks these <b>traffic</b> <b>levels</b> using a metric known as average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the average traffic volume for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that an average of 22,280vehicles used the section of M-57 through Clio daily. East of this area, the highway once again passes through rural agricultural lands on the way to its eastern terminus at M-15, one mile (1.6km) north of Otisville. This terminal section of the trunkline had the lowest <b>traffic</b> <b>levels</b> in 2009 at 3,737vehicles AADT.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} of the research work is to assess day time <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> at curbside open-air microenvironment of Kolkata city, India under heterogeneous environmental conditions. Results: Prevailing <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> in terms of A-weighted equivalent noise level (Leq) at the microenvironment was in excess of 12. 6 ± 2. 1 dB(A) from the day time standard of 65 dB(A) for commercial area recommended by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Noise Climate and Traffic Noise Index of the microenvironment were accounted for 13 ± 1. 8 dB(A) and 88. 8 ± 6. 1 dB(A) respectively. A correlation analysis explored that prevailing <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> of the microenvironment had weak negative (− 0. 21; p < 0. 01) and very weak positive (0. 19; p < 0. 01) correlation with air temperature and relative humidity. A Varimax rotated principal component analysis explored that motorized traffic volume had moderate positive loading with background noise component (L 90, L 95, L 99) and prevailing <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> had very strong positive loading with peak noise component (L 1, L 5, L 10). Background and peak noise component cumulatively explained 80. 98 % of variance in the data set. Conclusions: <b>Traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> at curbside open-air microenvironment of Kolkata City was higher than the standard recommended by CPCB of India. It was highly annoying also. Air temperature and relative humidity had little influence and the peak noise component had the most significant influence on the prevailing <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> at curbside open-air microenvironment. Therefore, <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> at the microenvironment of the city can be reduced with careful honking and driving...|$|R
40|$|In {{simulation}} {{studies the}} focus has traditionally been on time-independent characteristics of queueing systems, particularly on the steady-state mean. The systems, {{even if they are}} in stochastic equilibrium, have also timedependent or dynamic properties which are of great practical importance.

In this paper we propose a way to examine dynamic properties of queueing systems through simulation.

The resulting binary sequence of indicators characterize the <b>traffic</b> <b>level</b> of the system. The variation in the <b>traffic</b> <b>level</b> is summarized through estimating the two histograms of level durations.

40|$|In Hong Kong, {{approximately}} {{one million people}} are affected by severe road traffic noise. It is crucial to estimate the vertical distribution of <b>traffic</b> noise <b>levels</b> at different levels in high-rise buildings during the planning and design stages for new residential buildings. The Calculation of Road Traffic Noise (CRTN) has been adopted in Hong Kong to estimate traffic noise from the road. However, there have been criticisms of the CRTN model?s accuracy and suitability for predicting road traffic noise in Hong Kong. This study examines and evaluates {{the accuracy of the}} CRTN method in predicting the vertical distribution of <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> LA 10 at different floor levels of a 20 -storey residential building in Hong Kong. Also, measurements have been conducted of the <b>traffic</b> noise <b>levels</b> at each floor level of the building. Both the predicted and measured LA 10 show a similar trend: the higher the floor level, the lower the <b>traffic</b> noise <b>levels.</b> However, the predicted LA 10 at the building façade has a tendency of overestimation, especially at the higher floor levels, with a mean difference of + 2. 0 dBA between the predicted and measured results. A correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 9331 between the predicted and the measured LA 10 indicates that the predicted levels correlate closely with the measured levels. The CRTN is therefore a useful tool in predicting <b>traffic</b> noise <b>levels</b> at different floor levels during the building planning stage. Practical application: This study provides an evaluation of the accuracy of the CRTN method in predicting the vertical distribution of <b>traffic</b> noise <b>level</b> at different floor levels of a residential building.
