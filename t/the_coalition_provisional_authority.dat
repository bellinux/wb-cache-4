5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{consider that}} the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq, due to its leadership of <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> in 2003–2004. But this is not {{borne out by the}} minutes of OPEC meetings, as no US representative attended in an official capacity.|$|E
5|$|From January to August 2000, Cross {{attended}} the Royal College of Defence Studies, {{after which he}} was promoted to major general (two-star rank) and appointed Director General, Defence Supply Chain. While Director General, he was responsible for the establishment of the United Kingdom's Joint Force Logistic Component for the forthcoming operations in Iraq and became involved in planning for the invasion of the country.

50|$|Following the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, senior British figures criticized {{the refusal of}} the US Government to heed British advice regarding post-war plans for Iraq, specifically <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> de-Ba'athification policy and the critical importance of preventing the power vacuum in which the insurgency subsequently developed. British defence secretary Geoff Hoon later stated that the United Kingdom 'lost the argument' with the Bush administration over rebuilding Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}}'s head {{of government}} was Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and his deputy was the influential and charismatic Barham Salih. The ceremonial head of state was President Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer. They were all sworn in at a second and more public ceremony on June 28, 2004, shortly after the small private one at which L.

Upon arrival in Baghdad, he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress that could have been made to stabilize Iraq. He left Baghdad two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007,Under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort by the Bush administration that witnessed other policy dissenters return to Baghdad, Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority’s</b> {{attempts to}} stabilize and reform Iraq’s economy along market lines. It argues that while security concerns remain serious, Iraq’s economy {{has not been}} crippled by violence. However, sustained economic growth will depend on whether Iraq’s future leaders pursue the pro-market approaches <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> has advocated. If the Iraqi economy is to reach its potential, it will need to go even farther than <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> did, implementing reforms <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> did not pursue because of security concerns.

50|$|After the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Hunter-Choat became head {{of security for}} <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> Program Management Office (PMO), which was responsible for funding reconstruction projects in the country. He was involved in some scandal when the PMO awarded a contract worth $293 million to Aegis Defence Services headed by Tim Spicer, who Hunter-Choat knew personally. However, there was no suggestion that Hunter-Choat had acted improperly. He was later responsible for making security plans for USAID in Afghanistan and was an accomplished lecturer on leadership and security.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{economic}} reform of Iraq, international projects have been implemented to repair and upgrade Iraqi water and sewage treatment plants, electricity production, hospitals, schools, housing, and transportation systems.

25|$|The United States and <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority,</b> run by Jay Garner {{and three}} deputies, {{including}} Tim Cross, opposed allowing democratic elections at this time, preferring instead to eventually hand over power to an unelected group of Iraqis.

50|$|The Transitional National Assembly, {{which was}} elected in January 2005 {{pursuant}} to <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> Transitional Administrative Law, appointed a Constitutional Committee {{for the purpose of}} preparing a draft constitution by August 15, 2005. The Committee was initially made up of 55 members, all of whom were drawn from the Transitional National Assembly, but its membership was eventually expanded beyond the Assembly's numbers, in order to allow representatives from the Sunni Arab community to participate (given that the latter had boycotted the elections that gave rise to the Transitional National Assembly).|$|R
50|$|The {{last book}} argues that {{consistent}} with the literature on state building, failed states, and foreign assistance, budgeting is a core state function that {{is necessary for the}} operations of a functional government. Employing an historical institutionalist approach, the book first explores the Ottoman, British, and Ba'athist origins of Iraq's budgetary institutions. The book next examines American prewar planning, <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> rule making and budgeting following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the mixed success of the American-led Coalition's capacity building programs initiated throughout the occupation.|$|R

25|$|The violent {{insurgency}} began {{shortly after}} the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and increased during the occupation. Originally, the insurgents targeted the coalition force (a majority of whom are from the United States and the United Kingdom) and the interim government (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority)</b> formed under the occupation. The insurgency grew during the period between the invasion of Iraq {{and the establishment of}} a new Iraqi government.|$|E
25|$|Militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr {{used his}} grass-roots {{organization}} and Mahdi Militia of {{over a thousand}} armed men {{to take control of}} the streets of Baghdad. <b>The</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> (CPA) soon realized it had lost control and closed down his popular newspaper. This resulted in mass anti-American demonstrations. The CPA then attempted to arrest al-Sadr on murder charges. He defied the American military by taking refuge in the Holy City of Najaf.|$|E
25|$|A {{military}} occupation was established {{and run by}} <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> (CPA), which later appointed and granted limited powers to an Iraq Interim Governing Council. Troops for the invasion came primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, but 29 other nations also provided some troops, and there were varying levels of assistance from Japan and other allied countries. Tens of thousands of private security personnel provided protection of infrastructure, facilities and personnel.|$|E

He appointed Ziyad Cattan, as the Defence Ministry's procurement chief, who has since fallen under suspicion {{of involvement in the}} greatest theft in history- embezzling $1bn intended for weapons purchase. al-Shaalan had received an exemption from the cabinet for having his ministry's expenditures overseen by the cabinet's audit committee. al-Shaalan claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority's</b> interim administrator of Iraq, Paul Bremer, had signed off the appointment of Cattan, but Bremer claims he had never heard of Cattan.|$|R

25|$|The zoological park {{used to be}} {{the largest}} in the Middle East. Within eight days {{following}} the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. South African Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Eventually, L. Paul Bremer, Director of <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> in Iraq from 11 May 2003 to 28 June 2004 ordered protection of the zoo and U.S. engineers helped to reopen the facility.|$|E
25|$|The Allawi government, with {{significant}} numbers of holdovers from <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority,</b> began to engage in attempts to secure control of the oil infrastructure, the source of Iraq's foreign currency, {{and control of the}} major cities of Iraq. The continuing insurgencies, poor state of the Iraqi Army, disorganized condition of police and security forces, as well as the lack of revenue hampered their efforts to assert control. In addition, both former Ba'athist elements and militant Shia groups engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities. The Allawi government vowed to crush resistance, using U.S. troops, {{but at the same time}} negotiated with Muqtada al-Sadr.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, the {{original}} Ba'ath Party was split in half; one half {{was led by}} the Damascus leadership of the Ba'ath Party which established a party in Syria, {{and the other half}} with its leadership in Baghdad. Both Ba'ath parties retained the same name and maintained parallel structures in the Arab world, but became so antagonistic that Syria — led by its Ba'ath party — became the only Arab state to support Iran against Iraq during the bloody Iran–Iraq War. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq {{for the first time in}} 1963, but were deposed several months later. The party's regional organisation governed Iraq between 1968 and 2003, for many years under the leadership of Saddam Hussein. The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region was banned in 2003 by <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> following the invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|In June 2003, <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> (CPA) {{banned the}} Ba'ath party. The {{additional}} step the CPA took—banning {{all members of}} the top four tiers of the Ba'ath Party from the new government, public schools and colleges—was criticized for blocking too many experienced people from participation in the new government. Thousands were removed from their positions, including doctors, professors, schoolteachers and bureaucrats. Many teachers lost their jobs, sparking protests at schools and universities. Under previous Ba'ath-party rule, one could not reach a high position in the government or a school without becoming a party member; party membership was a prerequisite for university admission. While many Ba'athists joined for ideological reasons, many more were members because {{it was a way to}} better their options. Following pressure by the US, the policy of de-Ba'athification was addressed by the Iraqi government in January 2008 with its controversial Accountability and Justice Act. This purported to ease the policy, but many feared it would lead to further dismissals. The Ba'ath Party is led by Saddam's former deputy, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority</b> (CPA) {{estimated}} that about 1.2 million Iraqis lived in Anbar in 2003, {{more than two-thirds}} of them in Fallujah and Ramadi. With a population 95 percent Sunni, many from the Dulaimi Tribe, Anbar is Iraq's only province without a significant Shia or Kurdish population. 95 percent of the population lives within [...] of the Euphrates. [...] At the time of the invasion, Fallujah was known as a religious enclave hostile towards outsiders, while Ramadi, the provincial capital, was more secular. Outside the cities, the ancient tribal system run by Sheikhs held considerable influence.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{delicate}} and pretentious endeavour to examine Iraq in current times. It is delicate {{in the sense that}} new facts and consequences of the Coalition’s presence in Iraq are broadcast on a daily basis and discussed worldwide. Yet it is also pretentious because of the impressive volume of academic work about Iraq that has appeared during the last four years. There is now a solid body of scholarship on issues such as the Coalition’s interpretation and misuse of occupation law, the legality of the use of force, Western imperialistic aspirations over Iraq, and successes and failures of <b>the</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Provisional</b> <b>Authority’s</b> administration of Iraq in 2003 and 2004. Keeping those concerns in mind, this paper establishes a discursive trajectory across all these topics. I will argue that the modern evolution of occupation law is intertwined with the Coalition’s misinterpretation and misuse of their obligations under international law, and examine how a radical interpretation of occupation law has affected the prospects of democracy and stability in Iraq...|$|R
