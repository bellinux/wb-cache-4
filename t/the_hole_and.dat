5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster would go into <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would {{fall to the ground}} and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E

50|$|The size of {{the film}} frame of motion picture film also depends on the {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> <b>the</b> shape of <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> location and type of sound stripe.|$|R

25|$|If diving {{without a}} tether follow line {{back to the}} hole. Always follow a line that leads strait to <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> avoid leaving the line unless {{you are able to}} use a jump line or are in visual sight of the ice hole.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method by}} which {{sustained}} release is achieved is through an osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system, where the active compound is encased in a water-permeable membrane with a laser drilled hole at one end. As water passes through the membrane the drug is pushed out through <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> into the digestive tract {{where it can be}} absorbed.|$|E
25|$|The {{disturbance}} in the jet is a symmetric vortex ring that moves at some speed {{slower than the}} mean jet speed until it encounters <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> some fluid is forced through it, resulting in a monopole-like sound field in the half space outside. The oscillatory volumetric flow in the hole sends a wave back to the orifice to complete the feedback loop and causing a nearly pure tone.|$|E

30|$|Then, we show <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> {{concentration}} profiles <b>and</b> {{radiative recombination}} rate profiles in the MQW region for all studied devices {{at the current}} density of 170  A/cm 2 in Fig.  6 b, c, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>hole</b> concentration <b>and</b> radiative rate profiles are collected at the position of 230  μm apart from the left-hand mesa edge. For the better visual resolution, <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> concentration <b>and</b> radiative recombination rate profiles for LEDs A, T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4, and T 5 are spatially shifted by 2  nm in Fig.  6 b, c, respectively. It is clearly shown that LED A has <b>the</b> lowest <b>hole</b> concentration <b>and</b> thus <b>the</b> lowest radiative recombination rate in the MQW region. <b>The</b> <b>hole</b> concentration <b>and</b> radiative recombination rate in the MQW region increase with the increasing thickness of the n-Al 0.40 Ga 0.60 N layer.|$|R
25|$|A camera obscura device {{consists}} of a box, tent or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and perspective preserved. The image can be projected onto paper, and can then be traced to produce a highly accurate representation.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{made the}} hole {{big enough to}} get into the next room, which was {{occupied}} only by patient Private Waters, and dragged the patients through. The last man out was Hook, who killed some Zulus who had knocked down the door before he dived through the hole. John Williams once again went to work, spurred on {{by the fact that the}} roof was now ablaze, as Hook defended <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> Waters continued to fire through a loophole.|$|E
25|$|After the Lamborghinis are {{seized by}} his creditor, Charlie finds himself $80,000 in <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> hatches {{a plan to}} return to Las Vegas, which they passed the night before, and win money at {{blackjack}} by counting cards. Though the casino bosses are skeptical that anyone can count cards with a six deck shoe, after reviewing security footage they ask Charlie and Raymond to leave. Charlie has made enough to cover his debts and has reconciled with Susanna who rejoined them in Las Vegas.|$|E
30|$|Assembly characteristics—these are {{conditions}} in assembling the bolted joint {{such as the}} difference between <b>the</b> lead <b>hole</b> diameter <b>and</b> bolt diameter, smoothness of <b>the</b> lead <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> force used to fasten the bolt.|$|R

25|$|These {{core drill}} bits {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to reamers as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from reamers {{in the amount of}} material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, {{he broke into}} a school to help {{a group of children}} steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings' and describes Carmack as 'a brain on legs'). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Mark 1 had to {{be programmed}} by entering alphanumeric characters representing a five-bit value that could be represented on the paper tape input. The engineers {{decided to use the}} simplest mapping between <b>the</b> paper <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> binary digits they represented, but the mapping between <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> physical keyboard was never meant to be a binary mapping. As a result, the characters representing the values from 0-31 (five-bit numbers) looked entirely random, specifically /E@A:SIU½DRJNFCKTZLWHYPQOBG"MXV£.|$|R

25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to <b>the</b> <b>hole),</b> <b>and</b> the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E
25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> <b>and</b> therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} did {{not bring}} about the desired success; for instance, on occasions when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. Rarely would anyone be sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two main responses in dealing with a tunnel opening were to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open, or to toss a few grenades down <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> “crimp” off the opening. This approach proved ineffective due {{to the design of}} the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and air filtration systems.|$|E
50|$|On 4 December 1532 the Shroud {{sustained}} a fire, which burned out several <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> fabric. In {{the spring of}} 1534 the Poor Clare Nuns patched <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>and</b> placed a backing Holland cloth on the reverse.|$|R
40|$|A toy {{model for}} the Blandford-Znajek {{mechanism}} is investigated: a Kerr black hole with a toroidal electric current residing in a thin disk around <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> in <b>the</b> equatorial plane. The toroidal electric current generates a poloidal magnetic field threading <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> disk. <b>The</b> rotation of <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> disk relative to the magnetic field induces an electromotive force, which can power an astrophysical load at remote distance. The power of <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> disk is calculated. It is found that, {{for a wide range}} of parameters specifying the rotation of <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distribution of the electric current in the disk, the power of the disk dominates the power of <b>the</b> black <b>hole.</b> <b>The</b> torque provided by <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> disk is also calculated. The torque of the disk is comparable to the torque of <b>the</b> black <b>hole.</b> As <b>the</b> disk loses its angular momentum, the mass of the disk gradually drifts towards <b>the</b> black <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> gets accreted. Ultimately the power comes from the gravitational binding energy between the disk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black <b>hole,</b> as in <b>the</b> standard theory of accretion disk, instead of the rotational energy of <b>the</b> black <b>hole.</b> This suggests that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism may not be effective in extracting energy from a rotating black hole with a disk. While this work is not a formal general proof of energetic non-effectiveness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, any serious suggestion to the contrary should be supported with a specific quantitative counter-example, demonstrating that there is a model for which the mechanism is effective.

25|$|Masters {{champion}} Jordan Spieth shot a {{round of}} 67 (−3) to tie Patrick Reed for the 36-hole lead. First round co-leader Dustin Johnson got as low as 7-under before bogeys on three of his last five holes dropped him to a stroke behind the leaders. Jason Day was just two shots off the lead playing the 9th hole, his 18th of the round, when he collapsed from vertigo. After being treated by medical personnel for several minutes, Day was able to finish <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> made bogey, dropping to three behind and a tie for 9th place. Tiger Woods missed the cut with a two-round score of 16-over-par, his worst 36-hole score in a major.|$|E
25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>and</b> they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
