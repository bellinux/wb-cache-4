5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} improbable. Constantius had already left Helena by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for Britain. Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone {{that she was a}} princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though {{it may have been a}} lost hagiography of Helena.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Crombie {{was once}} again transferred, this time to No.176 Squadron RAF {{stationed}} in India, operating in support of operations in the Burma Campaign; he arrived at his new post on 12 January and was promoted to flight lieutenant five days later. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the Middle East, Crombie had been accorded an official tally of nine Axis aircraft shot down, with two probables.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Cleopatra notwithstanding, Etty {{remained}} {{a student at}} the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences the last <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> England.|$|E

5|$|William Chapman {{was born}} in Clarksburg, Virginia, (now West Virginia) on August 11, 1808. His father died when William was fourteen, at which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> home to earn his own way. He was educated in the public schools, and then {{took a job as}} a court clerk, while {{studying}} law on his own time. In 1832, after reading law, he earned his law license and began practice in Middletown.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Born in Perth, Scotland, Buchan was {{admitted}} to the University of Glasgow in 1892 to study classics; during his first year at university he edited the works of Francis Bacon, which were published in 1894. The following year he was awarded a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford; shortly after his arrival he also published his first novel, Sir Quixote of the Moors, which he dedicated to Gilbert Murray, his university tutor.

5|$|In 1938, Eichmann {{was posted}} to Vienna to help organise Jewish {{emigration}} from Austria, which {{had just been}} integrated into the Reich through the Anschluss. Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration. Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control. Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, created in August. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 Jews had left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May he was graded First Class Flier. The {{grade was}} based upon his achievements; he had {{achieved}} a dead-stick landing within a fifty-yard marker, a 15-minute flight at 6,000 feet, a 60-mile cross-country flight and 15 hours solo flying. On 24 May he passed his final test with a two-hour flight from Salisbury, to Southampton and onto Basingstoke. His 74 hours flying experience was well above the minimum. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for France in June he had accumulated 121 flying hours, given 177 lessons as instructor, and had personally tutored 40 student pilots.|$|E
5|$|Some Doppers {{preferred}} {{to embark on}} another trek, north-west across the Kalahari Desert towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the Dorsland Trek of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, {{but he refused to}} take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.|$|E
50|$|John L. Hess (December 27, 1917 - January 21, 2005) was a {{prominent}} American investigative journalist who worked for many years at The New York <b>Times.</b> <b>He</b> <b>left</b> the <b>Times</b> in 1978 and wrote a memoir about his years there, My Times: A Memoir of Dissent.|$|R
50|$|With the {{unsettled}} political <b>times,</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the University in 1674 {{and moved}} to London. In London, his political and religious sentiments prompted him to support the Whigs. His energetic and bustling character led him {{to take an active}} part in the controversies of the <b>time,</b> and <b>he</b> endeavoured to bring about a reconciliation between Episcopacy and Presbytery.|$|R
50|$|Gordon {{played for}} Rangers, but signed for Bury from Scottish non-league side Petershill. <b>He</b> played 24 <b>times</b> for Bury over a seven-year period, joining Buxton on leaving.

5|$|The {{plans were}} varied {{again in the}} {{following}} years, but the design of Lake Burley Griffin remained based largely on the original committee's plan. It was later gazetted and legally protected by the federal parliament in 1926, based on a 1918 plan. However, Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities {{and a lack of}} federal government funding meant that by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> in 1920, little significant work had been done on the city. A 1920s proposal to reduce West Lake into a ribbon of water was {{made on the basis of}} flood safety. However, the Owen and Peake report of 1929 ruled that the original design was hydrologically sound.|$|E
5|$|Born to an upper-middle-class {{family in}} Saint Ann Parish, Williamson {{initially}} considered {{a life in}} the Roman Catholic clergy before deciding to devote himself {{to the cause of}} gay rights in Jamaica. In the 1990s, he purchased an apartment building in the New Kingston area of Kingston, in which he established a gay nightclub, which remained open for two years despite opposition from police. In 1998, he co-founded J-FLAG with other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, soon becoming the public face of the organisation. As J-FLAG's representative, he argued in favour of LGBT rights during appearances on Jamaican television and radio programs. This attracted great hostility within Jamaica – a country with particularly high rates of anti-gay prejudice – with J-FLAG members receiving death threats and Williamson surviving a knife attack. For a <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Jamaica, living in Canada and England for several years, before returning to Kingston in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Bruce also greatly {{strengthened}} {{the research and}} information-gathering capacity of the executive, and sought to make decisions and policy {{on the basis of}} the best available evidence and information. A record 22 Royal Commissions reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO. He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> office, he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional capacity of the Australian prime minister.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E
5|$|During Willis's term, state revenue {{increased}} {{because of}} to wartime inflation, increased federal money, {{and the relative}} prosperity of the state's economy. The state budget was $31 million when Willis took office; by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> office, it had expanded to $52 million. Much of these funds were devoted to education. Expenditures per pupil nearly doubled, as did teacher salaries. The school year was lengthened from seven to eight months. Counties were also allowed to double their school tax rate. He created a Commission on Negro Affairs, appointed the first African-American to the state Board of Education, and increased state aid to pay out-of-state tuition to minorities who had been denied admission to professional programs in the state universities.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed {{had decided}} to {{construct}} a fortress {{in what is now}} Elbasan which would provide a perennial base for future Ottoman assaults on Skanderbeg's domains. The fortress especially worried Venice since Elbasan was constructed {{on the banks of the}} Shkumbin River which would allow the Ottomans to send ships into the Adriatic and threaten Venetian colonies. Seeing that his situation had become unfavorable, Skanderbeg made a trip to Italy where he would try to convince Pope Paul II and Ferdinand I of Naples to give him aid for his war. Despite many promises from the pope, Skanderbeg received little due to the fear of a Neapolitan war with Rome and infighting in the Roman Curia. Ferdinand and the Republic of Venice likewise deferred Skanderbeg's requests to the pope. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> Italy, the League of Lezhë had been weakened and needed his intervention.|$|E
50|$|Damian {{signed for}} Hamilton Academical on 31 August 2010 for an {{undisclosed}} fee, on a two-year deal. On 11 April 2011, Casalinuovo was released by Hamilton, having made 19 appearances {{for them in the}} Scottish Premier League. On 6 January 2012 Damian rejoined Raith Rovers {{until the end of the}} season. After making eleven appearance and scoring three <b>times</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> the club.|$|R

5|$|The {{character}} {{has said he}} was regularly beaten up in high school, and by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> for college he was determined never {{to be a victim}} again. As such, {{on the first day of}} his freshman year he walked into class and punched the first person he saw (unfortunately, this happened to be his ethics professor). He attended Dartmouth College (instead of his first pick, Hogwarts, claiming that his white owl led them to reject him), and was a member of the ΣΑΕ fraternity, although his acceptance into the college appears to have been largely influenced by a claimed familial relationship with a wealthy donor, and graduated in the top 47 percent of his class with a major in history. He has also referred to Bob Jones University as an alma mater.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} blue plaques in England that commemorate places {{associated}} with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham {{and one in}} Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived {{between the ages of}} four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and most of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|While the {{vocational}} proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools {{for gifted students}} or those wishing to study a specific subject. These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949. In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk {{to prepare students for}} a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport. Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, and by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.|$|E
