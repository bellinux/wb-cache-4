5|$|While {{working at}} <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>store,</b> Gardiner first played {{organised}} sports {{as a member}} of the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as the children who were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E

25|$|After 1910 steady {{population}} decline {{was driven}} {{by the lack of}} significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. <b>The</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> closed in 1928 and the bank, like thousands of other undercapitalized small-town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 {{in the aftermath of the}} stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney's population at 19. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The only commercial building remaining on the main drag is the former James Bigsby general store, later the G.A. Klugman general store, which also housed the post office until its closing in 1980. The building was vacant for several years, but was recently purchased and is being rehabilitated.|$|E

When the couple's first child was stillborn, Gates {{returned to his}} old pattern of playing poker and thought seriously about leaving town with Dellora. With this knowledge, Mary Gates told her husband he needed to help his son financially so he could start a new business. [...] Gates' father-in-law, Ed Baker, had already offered to help his daughter and son in law in this way. Asel purchased a two-story brick building and Ed Baker provided the capital for stock to open a hardware store in Turner Junction. At first the business went well; Gates and Dellora were able to move into their own home. [...] Gates began taking time away from <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> and while his partner tried to handle all the business, {{he was not able}} to. A son, Charles Gilbert Gates, was born to Gates and Dellora on May 21, 1876. Gates began to complain of various ailments soon after the baby's birth; at times, he would take to his bed for some days with them. [...] Business at <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>store</b> had become so bad, Gates was not able to afford the rent on the family's home.

[...] He made a trip to San Antonio, Texas in 1876 where Isaac Ellwood hired him as {{a salesman}} for the Washburn-Moen barbed wire company. [...] After being assigned to work in Texas, Gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions, when it came to selling barbed wire, ranchers were not buying. [...] After watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold, Gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire. In San Antonio's Military Plaza, Gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break. Gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration.|$|E

Morgan revealed he searched the aisles of a local store at Sunset Boulevard for days to get inspiration regarding Erin's death at <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>store.</b> According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is afraid of losing control, as well as the roller coaster.

500|$|... "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{was written}} by current showrunner Al Jean and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April11,1999. It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel, a job which he despised. [...] "Every other day [...] I said 'I wish I was back at The Simpsons," [...] Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from {{a segment of the}} television news magazine 60 Minutes. The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, [...] "take basically garbage and assemble it and turn it into artwork that would sell {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars." [...] Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer. In the episode, [...] "Start here tomorrow 7/17/95" [...] is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July17,1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from <b>the</b> <b>hardware</b> <b>store.</b> The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.|$|E
