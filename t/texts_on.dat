5|$|According to David White, Yoga Yajnavalkya {{was more}} {{significant}} in practice than the Patanjali's Yogasutras before the 12th century. Among the <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> asanas and meditation, it dominated the Indian yoga scene. Along with texts such as Yoga Vasistha, chapters embedded inside the Hindu epic the Mahabharata and literature related to traditions such as Hatha Yoga, Pashupata Yoga and Tantric Yoga, the Yoga Yajnavalkya was historically influential in Indian spiritual traditions.|$|E

5|$|Coutances died on 16 November 1207 and {{was buried}} at Rouen Cathedral, {{in the chapel}} of Saints Peter and Paul. The {{inventory}} of his personal possessions made after his death included {{a large number of}} jewels and vestments.

5|$|Guidelines for the {{preparation}} of Krishna icons in design and architecture are described in medieval-era Sanskrit <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> Hindu temple arts such as Vaikhanasa agama, Vishnu dharmottara, Brihat samhita, and Agni Purana. Similarly, early medieval-era Tamil texts also contain guidelines for sculpting Krishna and Rukmini Devi (she is {{sometimes referred to as}} Sauriraja-pperumal in Tamil). Several statues made according to these guidelines are in the collections of the Government Museum, Chennai.|$|E
5|$|In the Eastern empire, {{laws and}} {{official}} documents were regularly translated into Greek from Latin. Both languages were in active use {{by government officials}} and the Church during the 5th century. From the 6th century, Greek culture was studied in the West almost exclusively through Latin translation. Latin loanwords appear liberally in Greek <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> technical topics from late antiquity and the Byzantine period.|$|E

5|$|Chinese books {{had reached}} Japan since circa 400 AD {{and had been}} {{imported}} in large quantities {{through a number of}} missions during the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Official missions ended after 894, but books continued to reach Japan in the mid to late Heian period through commercial exchange or via priests travelling to China. Imported Chinese books were copied at Japanese libraries, but unlike sutra copying {{little is known about the}} actual copying process of Chinese secular works in Japan. The Japanese aristocracy and clergy sponsored the transcription of religious and government <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> a large scale by the Nara period.|$|E
5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha likely {{emerged as}} a deity {{as early as the}} 2nd century AD, but most {{certainly}} by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.|$|E

Signs to points of interest (services, institutions, tourist sights) have white <b>text</b> <b>on</b> a brown background. Patching (according to the Guildford Rules) is used to show roads of different classification on signs. On all purpose roads, signs for roads whose only destination is a motorway should display the motorway symbol.|$|R

5|$|Handscroll: The handscroll {{originated}} from ancient Chinese text documents. From the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE) through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), bamboo or wooden slips were bound {{and used to}} write <b>texts</b> <b>on.</b> During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of paper and silk as handscrolls became more common. The handscroll was {{the one of the}} main formats for texts up until the Tang dynasty (618-907). Since the Three Kingdoms (220–280), the handscroll became a standard form for mounting artwork. New styles were developed over time.|$|E

5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> the walls of the pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender and this has been repeated in a number of authoritative <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E
5|$|In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, {{where the}} firm of Broadwood {{provided}} him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements {{of some of his}} mazurkas to Spanish <b>texts.</b> <b>On</b> 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.|$|E

5|$|In the 8th century AD {{the city}} had {{important}} relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the Petexbatún region, and on the Pasión and Usumacinta rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasión), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasión becomes the Usumacinta), and Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Tamarindito, Arroyo de Piedra and Cueva de Sangre (all five in the Petexbatún region). It {{is possible that the}} widespread distribution of Ik-style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbatún region may be linked to the military defeat of Motul de San José by Dos Pilas, with these high quality ceramics forming a part of the tribute payment made to the Petexbatún kingdom. After its defeat {{at the hands of the}} Petexbatún kingdom, Motul de San José no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a certain extent in <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> Ik-style ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Its {{primary goal}} was to inform the Greek-speaking public within the Ottoman Empire and in the diaspora. Moreover, in favouring the views of Adamantios Korais it {{reflected}} the style of other European periodicals of that era. It reviewed developments in arts and sciences and was an important channel for bringing contemporary intellectual movements {{to the attention of}} the Ottoman-ruled Greeks. Additionally, it reproduced catalogues of European scientific books, and exhorted Greek scholars to translate and publish them, like those of Louis Jacques Thénard. The journal also published comments on astronomical observations, experiments and various articles on natural philosophy, which alternated with articles on history and philosophy. Greek scholars used as sources German or French educational books on physics, or translated and published <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> natural philosophy with large circulations in Europe, like the works of Antoine Fourcroy, René Just Haüy, and Jérôme Lalande.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} {{was reported in}} September in Courrier de l'Égypte, the official newspaper of the French expedition. The anonymous reporter expressed a hope that the stone might one day {{be the key to}} deciphering hieroglyphs. In 1800, three of the Commission's technical experts devised ways to make copies of the <b>texts</b> <b>on</b> the stone. One of these experts was Jean-Joseph Marcel, a printer and gifted linguist, who is credited as the first to recognise that the middle text was written in the Egyptian Demotic script, rarely used for stone inscriptions and seldom seen by scholars at that time, rather than Syriac as had originally been thought. It was artist and inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté who found a way to use the stone itself as a printing block to reproduce the inscription. A slightly different method was adopted by Antoine Galland. The prints that resulted were taken to Paris by General Charles Dugua. Scholars in Europe were now able to see the inscriptions and attempt to read them.|$|E
