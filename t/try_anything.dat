25|$|Assigning jobs in occupations {{that women}} had never held before was a {{daunting}} task. By social custom, working {{women did not}} work in the trades and rarely supervised men. Women worked mainly in offices, classrooms, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, and beauty shops. In 1943, Marine Corps manpower was in short supply, but members of the WR were available {{to pick up the}} slack. However, the corps had to select, train, classify, and assign the women to jobs where they could contribute and do so in the shortest amount of time. After completing their Marine Corps indoctrination training, selected women received advanced schooling in a variety of specialties. By {{the end of the war}} 9,641 members of the WR had attended more than 30 specialist schools run by higher educational institutions, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Colonel Streeter's philosophy was to let them <b>try</b> <b>anything,</b> except heavy lifting and combat. The WR strength on 1June 1945 was 17,672. Of this number 1,342 were engaged in occupations classified as professional or semi-professional; 10,279 in clerical; 741 in sales; 587 in services; 344 in skilled trades; 1,305 as semi-skilled; 14 as unskilled; 35 as students; and 6 as unaccounted for. Marine Corps recruiting literature indicated there were over 200 types of jobs available in the WR. While this may have been correct, the fact was that well over half the women were assigned to and worked in clerical fields. The first duty posts and stations for the WR included places such as Washington, D.C.; New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Diego; and Quantico, Virginia. Marine aviation was the fastest-growing unit of the Corps. Both officers and enlisted women served at Marine Corps Air Stations including Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina; Paris Island, South Carolina; El Centro, El Toro, Mojave, and Santa Barbara, California.|$|E

[...] Under pressure from Germany, the Italian Fleet planned to launch an attack on the British Fleet on 28 March 1941.|$|E

At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, {{and the network}} was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian {{from the field and}} placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News, then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. [...] "ABC was in bad shape at the time," [...] Jennings said.

He also criticized the series for low stakes writing that [...] "While Andy's character might be reflecting on his management skills, and Pam and Angela might be pregnant, nothing about the eighth season" [...] of the series suggested that the show would <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> other than what it had already established as the status quo.

500|$|PopMatters {{named it}} the best album of 2010 in its year-end list. MTV and Entertainment Weekly placed it at number eight on their lists of the 20 Best Albums of 2010. The Guardian ranked the album number one on its list of 2010's top 40 albums, stating in {{conclusion}} [...] "No other album this year seems so alive with possibility. Monáe is young and fearless enough to <b>try</b> <b>anything,</b> gifted enough to pull {{almost all of it}} off, and large-hearted enough to make it feel like a communal experience: Us rather than Me". The ArchAndroid was voted the fourth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010. Five songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Tightrope" [...] (number two), [...] "Cold War" [...] (number 22), [...] "Wondaland", [...] "Locked Inside", and [...] "Sir Greendown" [...] (all tied for number 549).|$|E

John Walker of MTV reviewed it positively writing, [...] "The sparkling, goddess-like centerpiece in a swirling sea of pink feathers, Beyoncé shines like a true showgirl on stage.

500|$|The band's {{live sound}} is {{different}} {{to that in}} the studio. Writing for NME, Hazel Sheffield said that Days Are Gone [...] "may confuse those won over by their raw, rocking live shows." [...] Recordings demonstrate the group's vocal pop style, while the group plays typical rock material such as Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Oh Well" [...] in concert. The group's background in wedding bands from their days as Rockinhaim has led them to cover many different songs live and for radio sessions, including Miley Cyrus' [...] "Wrecking Ball", Sheryl Crow's [...] "Strong Enough" [...] and the Strokes' [...] "I'll <b>Try</b> <b>Anything</b> Once" [...] (an early version of [...] "You Only Live Once").

500|$|Many of the {{participants}} spoke favorably {{of the program and}} reported improved physical and mental health. Others said they were just taking advantage of the free saunas. One Fire Department lieutenant was quoted describing colleagues as desperate for help with the distress they felt {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, to the point that they would <b>try</b> <b>anything.</b> Fire Department officials raised concerns about the project, saying that firefighters were being required to give up inhalers, pills and other orthodox medication. Two weeks into the program, one firefighter passed out and was taken to an emergency room with severe asthma, later saying that he had been asked to stop using his inhaler. According to the clinic's associate medical director, Dr. Kawabena Nyamekye, participants were being helped off medication at their own insistence, not at the request of Downtown Medical. A former worker at Downtown Medical told reporters that staff were discouraged from calling for an ambulance even in an emergency, and that one of them had been required to break off contact with her boyfriend because he had left Scientology. A spokesman responded that the clinic had [...] "a clear policy of calling 911 when needed." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN was {{positive}} about [...] "Homer The Whopper", giving it an 8.6/10 rating. He {{commented that the}} first act of the episode was the strongest, while the others were weaker. Canning believed {{the reason for this}} was that the viewers have already seen Homer [...] "struggle with his weight countless times, and Rogen's trainer, though funny much of the time, will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role." [...] He added, however, that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find [...] "a few new angles with the weight jokes, so it's not a complete loss." [...] Overall, Canning thought [...] "Homer The Whopper" [...] was a good start to the twenty-first season, and although the plot may not be very original, the writers added [...] "freshness to the proceedings." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff did not think the script was as good as Gervais', but commented that Rogen and Goldberg [...] "managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere." [...] He added that he thought the Hollywood satirizing featured in this episode had been overused on the show, but [...] "the specificity of what the [...] was making fun of—trainers who help stars slim down (in this case, helping Homer slim down)—went a long way toward making the episode palatable." [...] VanDerWerff concluded that while the episode [...] "didn’t <b>try</b> <b>anything</b> new , [...] had fun with it all the same." ...|$|E
