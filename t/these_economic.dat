5|$|Despite <b>these</b> <b>economic</b> indicators, the Budget {{presented}} in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean {{government}} delayed their naval plans after {{a financial}} depression {{brought on by}} the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake and a drastic fall in the nitrate market in 1907, but <b>these</b> <b>economic</b> problems were not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina. While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to Peruvian military acquisitions.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. <b>These</b> <b>economic</b> circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} {{example of the}} country’s economic evolution is the international financial services industry based in London. Within this sector aviation services are seen as critically important for both businesses and their clients, even {{in the era of}} video-conferencing. London’s air transport services are widely regarded within the London business community surveyed by the OEF to provide a competitive advantage over the rest of Europe, and expansion of airport capacity in the South East has significant support. Whilst <b>these</b> <b>economic</b> contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{propose that}} {{unilateral}} or multilateral moratoriums and federal intervention {{be used to}} solve <b>these</b> <b>economic</b> inefficiencies. For example, in a 2009 article, entertainment attorney Schuyler M.

Partly {{as a result of}} <b>these</b> <b>economic</b> tensions, in the 1930s, there was another round of sectarian rioting in the city, although the most significant unrest of the period, the Outdoor Relief Riots of 1932, was notable for its non-sectarian nature.|$|E

25|$|While the {{production}} and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar and other commodities remain important, industrialisation has increased the importance of food processing, textiles, telecommunications and finance. The country's main economic sectors are tourism, tea export, clothing, rice production and other agricultural products. In addition to <b>these</b> <b>economic</b> sectors, overseas employment, especially in the Middle East, contributes substantially in foreign exchange.|$|E
25|$|The {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} food and the dense populations that it supported made division of labor possible. The rise of nonfarming specialists such as craftsmen and scribes accelerated economic growth and technological progress. <b>These</b> <b>economic</b> and technological advantages eventually enabled Europeans to conquer {{the peoples of the}} other continents in recent centuries by using the guns and steel of the book's title.|$|E

Subsequent governments took measures that harmed the economic productivity of Turkey in various ways. The achievements of the 1930s were credited to early (1920s) implementation of the economic system based on the national policies of Mustafa Kemal and his team.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} migration of Bulgarians to the Czech Republic {{began in the}} 1990s. 4,363 citizens claimed to have Bulgarian nationality in the 2001 census. They mostly live in the large cities and towns, such as Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Karlovy Vary, Kladno, Ústí nad Labem, Děčín, and Havířov. Nowadays the newcomers from Bulgaria aim for these areas in particular, where they can join an already established community.

The old system of internal passports (the hukou) were introduced in 1956, preventing inter-county travel without appropriate authorization. Highest priority was given to the urban proletariat for whom a welfare state was created.|$|E

25|$|Tremendous {{development}} {{took place}} in the cultivation of economic crops, cultivation and collection of forest products such as kolanut (cola acuminata, Obi abata and cola nitida, gbanja) and oil palm produce, commerce and trade. Much of the impetus of all these came initially from Mr. Isaac Ifamuboni (later Babamuboni) and a number of early Christians from Lagos, Abeokuta and Ibadan. These men introduced the cultivation of cocoa, maize, brown cocoyam etc. to Ekiti.

In their book Why Nations Fail, {{as well as}} a paper titled The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors show that the colonial disease environment shaped the tendency for Europeans to settle the territory or not, and whether they developed systems of agriculture and labor markets that were free and egalitarian versus exploitative and unequal. These choices of political and economic institutions, they argue, shaped tendencies to democracy or dictatorship over the following centuries.|$|E
