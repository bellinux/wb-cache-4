A photograph of a wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>model</b> published with the article showed a twin-engine aircraft with twin vertical tail fins. The aircraft would carry its weapons internally like the F-22 Raptor. New Scientist called attention to the angular, faceted features of the design, comparing them to the F-117 Nighthawk.|$|E
25|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{is a tool}} used in {{aerodynamic}} research to {{study the effects of}} air moving past solid objects. A wind tunnel consists of a tubular passage with the object under test mounted in the middle. Air is made to move past the object by a powerful fan system or other means. The test object, often called a wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>model,</b> is instrumented with suitable sensors to measure aerodynamic forces, pressure distribution, or other aerodynamic-related characteristics.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} for boundary layer wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling.</b> For example, understanding {{the impact of}} wind on high-rise buildings, factories, bridges, etc. can help building designers construct a structure that stands up to wind effects in the most efficient manner possible. Another significant application for boundary layer wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling</b> is for understanding exhaust gas dispersion patterns for hospitals, laboratories, and other emitting sources. Other examples of boundary layer wind tunnel applications are assessments of pedestrian comfort and snow drifting. Wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling</b> is accepted as a method for aiding in Green building design.

2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{is located}} {{close to the}} former Aust Ferry. The bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge of conventional design, with the deck supported by two main cables slung between two steel towers. In 1966 the cables supporting the bridge deck were spun from [...] of wire. The main cables are each made up of 8,322 individual [...] wires. An unusual feature of the suspension cables carrying the deck {{is that they are}} not vertical, as for most suspension bridges, but rather arranged in a zig-zag fashion, with adjacent mounts closely spaced. The triangulation this offers is an attempt to reduce vibration, as is the prominent use of Stockbridge dampers on the cables. The bridge is [...] long, consisting of a [...] central span between the towers and the two [...] side spans. The towers rise to [...] above mean high water and are of hollow box construction. The deck is an orthotropic steel box girder of aerofoil shape with cantilevered cycle tracks and footway supported from the box. The shape of the bridge was determined by the designers Freeman, Fox and Partners following wind tunnel tests for the Forth Road Bridge, after the original wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>model</b> was accidentally destroyed. The sections of the deck were built at Fairfield-Mabey in Chepstow, and each 132tonne section was then floated down the river before being hoisted into position.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} high Reynolds number {{cryogenic}} wind tunnels has forced alteration of manufacturing and assembly techniques and eliminated usage of many materials associated with conventional wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>models.</b> One {{of the techniques}} affected is soldering. Solder alloys commonly used for wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>models</b> are susceptible to low-temperature embrittlement and phase transformation. The low-temperature performance of several solder alloys is being examined during research and development activities being conducted in support of design and fabrication of cryogenic wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>models.</b> Among the properties examined during these tests are shear strength, surface quality, joint stability, and durability when subjected to dynamic loading.

40|$|Wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling</b> is a {{very useful}} tool to assess and {{mitigate}} odors from industrial, laboratory, sewage treatment, hospital, and landfill pollutant sources. As the EPA Fluid Modeling Guideline so aptly puts it: “A well-designed and carefully executed fluid modeling study will yield valid and useful information – {{information that can be}} applied to real environmental problems – with just as much and generally more credibility than any current mathematical models. ” This paper discusses the validity of wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling</b> and how these studies are conducted, and also presents three applications to assess and mitigate odor impacts. The first application deals with odorous engine exhaust from a natural gas pumping station. A resident was complaining of odors during certain operating and weather conditions. Wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling</b> was conducted to provide the operator various alternatives to solve the problem. The alternatives ranged from taller stacks to installing induced air exhaust fans. The second application relates to the Puente Hills Landfill in Los Angeles. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how the changing landscape of the landfill (existing versus future contours) would affect levels of odors experienced by the nearby community. Wind tunnel testing confirmed that odors will decrease for the future configuration. The third application relates to odor impacts from laboratories and hospitals. Wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>modeling</b> was used to determine the optimum exhaust system such that odor impacts are minimized...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} stylus and optical {{techniques}} for {{the measurement of}} surface roughness in wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>models.</b> The stylus instruments provide detailed information, such as surface profiles and area maps, that may then be used either to calculate statistical properties (i. e., the rms surface roughness) or to study individual surface peaks or other features. By contrast, certain optical techniques yield area-averaged statistical properties of the surface roughness directly. Two instruments that use the technique of optical angular scattering are compared. One is a research instrument that has been developed to study the basic scattering phenomena by testing the optical theories and surface models used in inverse calculations of statistical roughness parameters. The second instrument is more compact and is under development as a hand held, on-line device to be used during manufacture of wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>models</b> for the National Transonic Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. The scattering geometries for the two instruments are compared and results from these instruments and the stylus technique are shown for roughness specimens that are typical of the surface finish of wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
