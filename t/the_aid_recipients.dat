30|$|In classic humanitarianism, the {{recipients}} of aid—often addressed as the beneficiaries, i.e. those to whom good is done—are typically depicted as victims. In everyday practice, however, they are often seen as potential cheats. The number of aid seekers usually surpasses resources, and agencies do {{all they can to}} control, check and double-check the authenticity of victims’ claims (Kibreab 2004). Although aid in this tradition is motivated by the desire to relieve suffering and is based on the ethics of a shared humanity, in practice, it is really delivered on the basis of mistrust of the society in which it operates and the local providers of aid and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> must be kept under close surveillance.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> imperfectly; <b>the</b> donor agency and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are subject to inefficiency; <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> experiences corruption; and adjustment of <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> performance is costly. Incentives between <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> donor and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for <b>the</b> poorest <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> <b>The</b> importance of <b>aid</b> agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in <b>aid</b> <b>recipients.</b> Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient.</b> Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so.

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced. The donor agency observes the true performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> with error. <b>The</b> donor agency itself operates under stochastically variables e¢ciency. <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> experiences rent-seeking behaviour.

The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of <b>aid,</b> in <b>the</b> sense that more aid comes to be allocated to <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> with good governance. Second, performance intensity of aid generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> will increase under strengthening performance intensity of aid.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Purpose This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence that awards of financial <b>aid</b> have on <b>the</b> educational decisions and academic achievement of applicants for freshman year financial aid at Oregon State University. The study was primarily concerned with the effectiveness of financial aid in assisting students to enroll and become established in college. Thus, students were followed only {{to the point where they}} returned or failed to return for the sophomore year. Design The design of the study was twofold. First, the 2801 applicants for freshman year financial aid at OSU for the 1969 - 1970 and 1970 - 1971 academic years were classified as <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> (N= 1354) and Non-Recipients (N= 1447), and were compared with a systematic sample of Non-Applicants (N= 742) in terms of 1) matriculation rates, 2) withdrawal rates, 3) suspension rates, 4) freshman year GPA, 5) number of credit hours completed, and 6) return rates for the sophomore year. For the second part of <b>the</b> study, <b>the</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipient</b> group was sub-grouped according to the type and amount of aid awarded and these sub-groups were compared in terms of the six variables above. Data for each of the years under study were analyzed separately to permit comparisons between years. By controlling the variables of sex, age and scholastic aptitude and achievement, conclusions regarding <b>the</b> effects of <b>aid</b> awards were drawn. Scholastic aptitude and achievement were controlled in the study by using multiple regression equations which were generated to predict freshman year GPA's for each student. The resulting predicted GPA was used as a covariate in testing the hypotheses concerned with academic achievement. Several statistical models were employed to test the hypotheses regarding differences among <b>the</b> groups studied. <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients,</b> Non-Recipients and Non-Applicants were compared using chi-square analysis and analysis of variance. Multi-variate discriminant analysis and least-squares analysis of covariance were conducted to compare <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> who were classified by the type and amount of aid awarded. Conclusions When the students who applied for financial aid were grouped into <b>the</b> categories of <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> and Non-Recipients, and compared to a sample of Non-Applicants, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Awards of aid are effective in increasing the matriculation rates of applicants for freshman year financial aid at Oregon State University. 2. Aid Applicants have higher predicted GPA's and have higher levels of academic achievement at OSU during the freshman year than do Non-Applicants. 3. Awards of aid do not affect the withdrawal rates, suspension rates, freshman year GPA, number of credit hours completed, or return rates for the sophomore year of applicants for freshman year financial <b>aid.</b> When <b>the</b> students in <b>the</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipient</b> category were subgrouped according to the type and amount of aid awarded, and these sub-groups were compared, the following conclusions were drawn: 4. <b>The</b> type of <b>aid</b> awarded to <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> does not affect their matriculation rates, withdrawal rates, suspension rates, freshman year GPA, number of credit hours completed, or return rates for the sophomore year. 5. <b>The</b> amount of <b>aid</b> awarded to <b>Aid</b> <b>Recipients</b> does not affect their matriculation rates, withdrawal rates, suspension rates, freshman year GPA, number of credit hours completed, or return rates for the sophomore year...|$|R

Over this period village leaders had considerable discretion in disbursing aid subject to official guidelines and periodic mon-itoring. We use a principal-agent model and household panel data for approximately 940 households to understand biases in the allocation of aid. The model shows that correlations between aid and observed measures of need are not a good measure of targeting because agents have incentives to distort allocations within targeted classes. Consistent with the model, we find that <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> match official criteria but disbursements are negatively correlated with determinants of need that are not easily observable by monitoring agencies, namely pre-aid consumption, self-reported power and involvement in village-level organizations.

In principle, conditionality could partly solve this problem, but only if the donor can make a binding commitment to increase disbursements in good relative to bad states.

On the other hand, Japan's official development assistance (ODA) program has been repeatedly criticised for being employed {{as a tool to}} promote Japan's own commercial interests. In this context, altruism could be a superficial principle of Japanese foreign aid policy which forms the 'tatemae' dimension while selfishness could represent a true hidden motive for <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> giving and form the 'honne' dimension. The present paper uses panel data analysis to examine which element – honne or tatemae – has influenced the decision-making process of allocation of Japan's ODA to Southeast Asia. The findings indicate that the volumes of Japan's exports to and income levels in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> countries had a significant influence on foreign <b>aid</b> distribution. <b>The</b> Japanese government tended to allocate bigger amounts of money to Japan's major trade partners in ASEAN. At the same time, the poorer nations in the region received more of Japan's ODA compared to the comparatively well-off nations. In other words, both altruism (tatemae dimension) and selfishness (honne dimension) characterise Japan's ODA flows...|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} from the {{implications}} of growth theory that <b>the</b> impact of <b>aid</b> depends on how it affects savings, investment and government behaviour. In respect of low-income countries, which are <b>the</b> principal <b>aid</b> <b>recipients</b> and <b>the</b> economies for which the issue of <b>the</b> impact of <b>aid</b> on growth is most important, it is government that is most important. This paper presents a review of studies that address <b>the</b> impact of <b>aid</b> on government fiscal behaviour. In particular, the focus is on fungibility and fiscal response studies. We argue that fungibility studies have been granted too much attention; these are narrowly focussed on the composition of government spending, and are not sufficiently informative about fiscal behaviour. Fiscal response studies are of greater relevance, as they attempt to address <b>the</b> effects of <b>aid</b> on behaviour regarding total spending, tax revenue and borrowing. Results show that the effects are complex and varied, but that aid tends to be associated with government spending increases in excess of the value of <b>the</b> <b>aid,</b> and can also have effects on tax effort and borrowing...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} twenty years of independence, Russia has {{recovered}} from economic and political shocks and demonstrates its commitment to gain new political and economic role in <b>the</b> global development <b>aid</b> architecture. International development assistance provided by Russia to other countries has increased from USD 100 million in 2004 to USD 610 million in 2013. The Concept of Russia's participation in the international development assistance, approved in 2007 and updated in 2014, outlines Russia’s priorities in <b>the</b> international <b>aid</b> sphere. Based on review of this concept, available official statistics and expert estimates, this paper provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of the dynamics and perspectives of Russia’s transformation from <b>the</b> international <b>aid</b> <b>recipient</b> into one of the donor countries. The results indicate that there is a large gap between Russia’s political ambitions and actual development aid policies; moreover, there is a shift towards a “soft power” concept in political decision making. At the same time, the potential of Russia’s embedding into <b>the</b> international development <b>aid</b> system remains high...|$|R
