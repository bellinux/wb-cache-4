Instead, following the approximate course of the White River, Curtis continued south and seized Helena, Arkansas, on July 12.|$|E

First he sought help from his sister Danutė and her husband Janusz I of Warsaw, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia. Eventually he came to his enemies, the Teutonic Knights, asking for protection and military aid against Jogaila.

He deposed Osroes I and put his own puppet ruler, the son of Osroes I, Parthamaspates on the throne. In Mesopotamia Osroes I's brother Mithridates IV and his son Sanatruces II took the diadem and fought against the Romans, but Trajan marched southward to the Persian Gulf, defeated them, and declared Mesopotamia a new province of the empire. Later in 116, he crossed the Khuzestan Mountains into Persia and captured the great city of Susa.|$|E
25|$|In the {{afternoon}} Ribault crossed over with eight gentlemen and was entertained by Menéndez. The French accepted some wine and preserves; {{but would not}} take more, knowing the fate of their companions. Then Ribault, pointing to the bodies of his comrades, which were visible from where he stood, said {{that they might have}} been tricked into the belief that Fort Caroline was taken, referring to a story he had heard from a barber who had survived the first massacre by feigning death when he was struck down, and had then escaped. But Ribault was soon convinced of his mistake, for he was allowed to converse privately with two Frenchmen captured at Fort Caroline. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to Menéndez and asked again for ships with which to return to France. The Spaniard was unyielding, and Ribault returned to his companions to acquaint them with the results of the interview.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} of the Safavid monarchs, Shah Abbas I the Great (1587–1629) {{came to power}} in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing Herat and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor Mohammad Khodabanda by the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590). <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> against the Ottomans, the Safavids their archrivals, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq and the Caucasian provinces and beyond by 1618. Between 1616–1618, following the disobedience of his most loyal Georgian subjects Teimuraz I and Luarsab II, Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating Kakheti and Tbilisi and carrying away 130,000 – 200,000 Georgian captives towards mainland Iran. His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of Robert Shirley and his brothers following the first diplomatic mission to Europe, pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the abovementioned 1603–1618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from Bahrain (1602) and Hormuz (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf.|$|E

500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats to take me away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
