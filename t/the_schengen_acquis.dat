25|$|During {{the migrant}} crisis of September 2015, Germany {{announced}} it was temporarily bringing border controls back {{in accordance with the}} provisions on temporary border controls laid down by <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b> Such border controls appear to be an attempt to prevent disorder from making the crisis worse.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Area {{consists}} of 22 European Union member states and four non-members {{who are members}} of EFTA: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

50|$|Although Ireland and the United Kingdom {{have not}} signed <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Agreement Application Convention, they {{take part in}} <b>Schengen</b> {{co-operation}} under <b>the</b> terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which introduced <b>the</b> provisions of <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> into European Union law. <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> allows <b>the</b> United Kingdom and Ireland {{to take part in}} all or part of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> convention arrangements. Ireland and the United Kingdom use <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Information System for law enforcement purposes.|$|R
25|$|Now that <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Agreement {{is part of}} the acquis communautaire, it has, for EU members, {{lost the}} status of a treaty, which could only be amended {{according}} to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties. Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing some or all of <b>the</b> former <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b> Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Area are now made by majority vote in the EU's legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.|$|R

25|$|When Schengen was subsumed {{into the}} EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam, Ireland and the UK {{obtained}} an opt-out from {{the part of}} the treaty which was to incorporate the Schengen rules (or acquis) into EU Law. Under the relevant protocol, Ireland and the United Kingdom may request to participate in aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> but this is subject to the approval of the Schengen states.|$|E
25|$|Like the UK, Gibraltar {{does not}} {{form part of}} the Schengen Area and, as a result, the border between Spain and Gibraltar is an {{external}} Schengen border through which Spain is legally obliged to perform full entrance and exit controls. However Gibraltar does participate in certain {{police and judicial cooperation}} aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> in line with the UK's request to participate in the same measures.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{formally}} {{requested to}} participate in certain provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> – Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation – in 1999, and this request {{was approved by the}} Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000. The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} {{and analysis of the}} EU law and policy on <b>Schengen</b> visas. <b>The</b> EU visa policy is analysed in its historical development and its place in <b>the</b> framework of <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b> Separately, important visa policy measures are analysed including the typology of visas, exceptions from visa obligation, visa reciprocity, visa facilitation and processes of visa liberalisation. Different phases of the visa procedure are studied with focus on the questions whether there is a right to be issued a <b>Schengen</b> visa when <b>the</b> conditions are met and the right of appeal. The relevant legislation subject to analysis is above all the Visa Code, the regulation on visa lists and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. By way of illustration, the implementation in the Czech legal order is used and jurisprudence of the Czech higher courts is quoted to show to what extent the EU visa procedure and visa refusal matches the requirements of the administrative law theory on the administrative procedure and decision in general. The relevant rules are assessed as to the extent they match with principles of legitimacy, influence of legal certainty, effectiveness and proportionality. The core of the work is a hypothesis that current EU visa rules do not establish a right to a visa when the [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Andorra {{has stayed}} outside <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> Agreement and {{maintains}} border controls with the EU.

Visitors to Andorra who require a visa to enter <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> area need a multi-entry Schengen visa, since to leave Andorra they must enter <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> area a second time.|$|R

25|$|The Schengen Agreement and its {{implementing}} Convention were {{enacted in}} 1995 only for some signatories, but {{just over two}} years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Agreement.

50|$|The Andorran {{government}} imposes no {{visa requirements}} on its visitors and only requires a passport or European Union {{national identity card}} for entrance. However, since the country is only accessible via <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> countries Spain or France, entrance is not possible without entering <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> area first and <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> visa rules can therefore be regarded to apply de facto. Because Andorra {{is not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> area, a multiple entry visa is required to reenter <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> area when leaving Andorra.|$|R

2500|$|To {{counter the}} {{potentially}} aggravating {{effects of the}} abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> contains compensatory police and judicial measures.

5000|$|The {{protocol}} on <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> and protocol on Denmark of the Treaty of Amsterdam {{stipulate that}} Denmark, {{which had been}} a full party to the Schengen Agreement, {{would continue to be}} bound by the provisions and would have the option to participate in future developments of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis,</b> but would do so on an intergovernmental basis rather than under EU law for the provisions which fell under the Justice and Home Affairs pillar, from which Denmark obtained an opt-out. However, the protocol stipulates that if Denmark chooses not to implement future developments of <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis,</b> the EU and its member states [...] "will consider appropriate measures to be taken". In the negotiations for the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark obtained an option to convert its Area of freedom, security and justice (which had incorporated the former Justice and Home Affairs pillar) opt-out into a flexible opt-in modelled on the Irish and British opt-outs. The Protocol stipulates that if Denmark exercises this option, then it will be bound by <b>the</b> <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> under EU law rather than on an intergovernmental basis. In a referendum on 3 December 2015, 53.1% rejected exercising this option.|$|E
