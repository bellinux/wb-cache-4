If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> health."

2500|$|Murat Kurnaz {{was born}} in Bremen, Germany, and grew up there. He was {{considered}} a Turkish citizen because his parents were immigrants, but they had {{lived and worked in}} Germany for years. He was a legal German resident and married a Turkish woman in Germany. In October 2001 Kurnaz at age 19 traveled from Germany to Pakistan, hoping to study at the Mansura Center (which turned him down); he spent the next two months as a tablighi, a Muslim pilgrim sojourning from mosque to mosque. In December 2001, while Kurnaz was on a bus to the airport to return to Germany, Pakistani police at a checkpoint detained him. After questioning him for a few days, they [...] turned him over to American soldiers. [...] Later Kurnaz learned that, after its invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks, the United States had distributed fliers there and in Pakistan promising “enough money <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family, your village, your tribe {{for the rest of your}} life” as a bounty for suspected terrorists. [...] Kurnaz says [...] "a great number of men wound up in Guantánamo as a result." [...] One of Kurnaz's interrogators at Guantanamo confirmed that he'd been [...] "sold" [...] for a $3,000 bounty.|$|E
