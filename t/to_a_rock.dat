5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock.</b> The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E
