40|$|The {{electrical}} breakdown {{has been investigated}} for low-pressure argon and nitrogen discharges under the influ-ence of an external longitudinal magnetic field. Plane-parallel aluminum electrodes (5 cm diameter) separated by a variable distance d (4. 0 cm < d < 11. 0 cm) were sustained with a dc voltage (0 < V < 1 kV). A Helmholtz coil was used to produce an uniform magnetic field(B) parallel to the discharge axis. Paschen curves were ob-tained and the secondary electron emission coefficient (γ), the first <b>Townsend</b> ionization <b>coefficient</b> (α) and the ionization efficiency(η), were plotted {{with respect to the}} variation of the reduced field (E/P). To observe the ef-fect of the magnetic field these curves were plotted for fixed values of B= 0 and B= 350 Gauss. As consequence of the longitudinal magnetic field, the free paths of the electrons in the Townsend discharge are lengthened and their lateral diffusion is reduced, thus reducing electron losses to the walls. The data presented in this paper give a quantitative description of the B-field effect on the <b>Townsend’s</b> <b>coefficients</b> and overall it is concluded that the DC {{electrical breakdown}} of the gases is facilitated if a longitudinal magnetic field is applied along the discharge axis. ...|$|R

40|$|The Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) of the ATLAS {{experiment}} at the LHC {{is part of}} the Inner Detector. It {{is designed}} as a robust and powerful gaseous detector that provides tracking through individual drift-tubes (straws) as well as particle identification via transition radiation (TR) detection. The straw tubes are operated with Xe-CO 2 -O 2 70 / 27 / 3, a gas that combines the advantages of efficient TR absorption, a short electron drift time and minimum ageing effects. The modules of the barrel part of the TRT were built in the United States while the end-cap wheels are assembled at two Russian institutes. Acceptance tests of barrel modules and end-cap wheels are performed at CERN before assembly and integration with the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) and the Pixel Detector. This thesis first describes simulations the TRT straw tube. The argon-based acceptance gas mixture as well as two xenon-based operating gases are examined for its properties. Drift velocities and <b>Townsend</b> <b>coefficients</b> are computed {{with the help of the}} program Magboltz and used to study electron drift and multiplication in the straw using the software Garfield. The inclusion of Penning transfers in the avalanche process leads to remarkable agreements with experimental data. A high level of cleanliness in the TRT's acceptance test gas system is indispensable. To monitor gas purity, a small straw tube detector has been constructed and extensively used to study the ageing behaviour of the straw tube in Ar-CO 2.
