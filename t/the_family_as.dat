5|$|Complete skeletons {{have been}} {{described}} only for the most advanced abelisaurids (such as Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus), {{making it difficult to}} establish defining features of the skeleton for <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> a whole. However, most are known from at least some skull bones, so known shared features come mainly from the skull.|$|E
5|$|Despite Husayn's {{rebellion}} and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al-Khadim and {{sharing in the}} ups and downs of the court politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan and Ali, better known by their honorific titles Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, who established <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who {{gradually}} became the castle's hereditary constables, renting the demesne lands on the estate from <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> well. The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.|$|E
40|$|This key treats of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> {{of marine}} fishes that are {{represented}} by species {{that have been found}} within a depth of 100 fathoms on the western coast of the United States, exclusive of Alaska. The characters here used do not define <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>as</b> a whole; but they serve as a means of identification of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>as</b> restricted by <b>the</b> fishes that happen to occur within the limits of the locality here considered. For instance, "Body tapering backwards to a point" is not a character that defines <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Soleidae, but it is a character of the only member of that family that is found on our coast. Hence this key is in most cases useless for the identification of these same <b>families</b> <b>as</b> represented in other localities...|$|R

5|$|Pantulf {{was from}} Noron in the Calvados region of Normandy.

5|$|A further {{testament}} to this devotion included Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction {{of the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> well as the house of the catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's son John VII is considered to be the first to have established this practice when he became the Catholicos whereas his nephew, also named John, became the second.|$|E

At an early age, Charles-Valentin and his siblings adopted their father's first name as their last (and were known by this during their studies at the Conservatoire de Paris and subsequent careers). His brother Napoléon (1826–1906) became professor of solfège at the Conservatoire, his brother Maxim (1818–1897) had a career writing light music for Parisian theatres, and his sister, Céleste (1812–1897), was a singer. His brother Ernest (1816–1876) was a professional flautist, while the youngest brother Gustave (1827–1882) was to publish various dances for the piano.|$|E

5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage.

5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> a slave.|$|E

5|$|John Komnenos married Anna Dalassene, the {{daughter}} of Alexios Charon, most likely in 1044. Anna, born c. 1028, long outlived her husband and after his death ran <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> its undisputed matriarch. Anna became involved in conspiracies against the Doukas family, whom she never forgave for taking the throne in 1059. Later she also {{played a major role}} in the successful overthrow of Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078–81) and the rise of her son Alexios to the throne. After that, and for about fifteen years, she served as the virtual co-ruler of the empire along her son. She then retired to a monastery, where she died in 1100 or 1102.|$|E
5|$|Marian Cruger Coffin (September 16, 1876 – February 2, 1957) {{was one of}} {{the first}} American women to work as a {{professional}} landscape architect, and became famous for designing numerous gardens for members of the East Coast elite to whom she had connections through her mother's side of <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> <b>As</b> a child, she received almost no formal education but was home-tutored while living with her mother's relatives in upstate New York. Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for a woman of her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901–4 as one of only four women in architecture and landscape design.|$|E
5|$|Nina McNary {{became the}} head of the household, while other {{siblings}} took jobs in order to provide for <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> <b>As</b> a boy, Charles worked as a paperboy, in an orchard, and at other farming tasks. He met Herbert Hoover, a future U.S. president, who moved to Salem in 1888. He later worked in the county recorder's office for his brother John Hugh McNary, who had been elected as county recorder in 1890, and for a short time attended the Capital Business College. After leaving that school, he enrolled in college preparatory classes at Willamette University, with an eye towards attending Stanford University or the University of California. During this time he met Jessie Breyman, whom he began dating, at a social club he helped start. Another member of the club was Oswald West, a future governor of Oregon.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>as</b> it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Several Jews {{and other}} {{survivors}} of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis. Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954. When Eichmann's father died in 1960, Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>as</b> Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance {{and there were no}} current photos of the fugitive.
