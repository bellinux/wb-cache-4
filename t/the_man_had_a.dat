500|$|Rumours that Richard {{was still}} alive persisted, but never gained much {{credence}} in England; in Scotland, however, a man identified as Richard came {{into the hands of}} Regent Albany, lodged in Stirling Castle, and serving as the notionaland perhaps reluctantfigurehead of various anti-Lancastrian and Lollard intrigues in England. Henry IV's government dismissed him as an impostor, and several sources {{from both sides of the}} Border suggest <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mental illness, one also describing him as a [...] "beggar" [...] by the time of his death in 1419, but he was buried as a king in the local Dominican friary in Stirling.

Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb, where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed.|$|E
