40|$|The {{spread of}} {{bacteria}} resistant to antimicrobial agents calls for population-wide treatment strategies to delay or reverse {{the trend toward}} antibiotic resistance.

A mathematical model suggests that the long-term benefit of single drug treatment from introduction of the antibiotic until a high frequency of resistance precludes its use is almost independent of the pattern of antibiotic use. When more than one antibiotic is employed, sequential use of different antibiotics in the population (“cycling”) is always inferior to treatment strategies where, at any given time, equal fractions of the population receive different antibiotics.

40|$|PROBLEM Chlamydia trachomatis {{infection}} {{is the most}} common sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection</b> worldwide and known to increase the risk for HIV acquisition. Few studies have investigated how infection of epithelial cells compromises barrier integrity and antimicrobial response. METHOD OF STUDY ECC- 1 cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line, were treated with live and heat-killed C. trachomatis. Epithelial barrier integrity measured as transepithelial resistance (TER), chemokines antimicrobial levels, and antimicrobial mRNA expression was measured by ELISA and Real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS Epithelial barrier integrity was compromised when cells were infected with live, but not with heat-killed, C. trachomatis. IL- 8 secretion by ECC- 1 cells increased in response to live and heat-killed C. trachomatis, while MCP- 1, HBD 2 and trappin 2 /elafin secretion decreased with live C. trachomatis. CONCLUSION Live C. trachomatis suppresses ECC- 1 innate immune responses by compromising the barrier integrity, inhibiting secretion of MCP- 1, HBD 2, and trappin- 2 /elafin. Differential responses between live and heat-killed Chlamydia indicate which immune responses are dependent on ECC- 1 infection rather than the extracellular presence of Chlamydia...|$|E

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether Mentha suaveolens essential oil (EOMS) can be considered as a promising candidate for preventing C. trachomatis infection. Specifically, we investigated the in vitro effects of EOMS towards C. trachomatis analysing the different phases of chlamydial developmental cycle. Our results demonstrated that EOMS was effective towards C. trachomatis, whereby it not only inactivated infectious elementary bodies but also inhibited chlamydial replication. Our study also revealed the effectiveness of EOMS, in combination with erythromycin, towards C. trachomatis with a substantial reduction in the minimum effect dose of antibiotic. In conclusion, EOMS treatment may represent a preventative strategy since it may reduce C. trachomatis transmission in the population and, thereby, reduce the number of new chlamydial infections and risk of developing of severe sequelae...|$|E

40|$|Chlamydia Trachomatis {{infections are}} the most common sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> worldwide: Because Chlamydia Trachomatis infections are {{asymptomatic}} in approximately 50 % of infected men and 70 % of infected women, there is a high risk for reproductive tract sequelae and high diffusion of the disease. Recently some studies improved the comprehension of this infection and its natural history highlighting the fact that severe complications can be avoided only by a proper early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We reviewed the literature related to the new findings in the treatment of Chlamydia Trachomatis infection in sexually active young men. Articles from 1960 - 2014 were identified through a Medline search using the keywords "Chlamydia Trachomatis" combined with "urethritis", "epididymitis", "prostatitis" "treatment" or "management". Several studies highlighted that Chlamidia are only metabolically active in the host cell and therefore only targeted intracellularly by antibiotics. However, even if the standard therapy includes intracellularly-accumulated antibiotics such as tetracyclines or macrolides, recent evidences highlight the role of quinolones. In particular recent studies hilight the role of prulifloxacin in the treatment of chronic prostatitis patients for improving patient's quality of life and decreasing the IL- 8 level.

As proof of principle, this method {{was applied to}} Chlamydia trachomatis-infected epithelial cell monolayers in vitro, successfully obtaining transcriptomes of both C. trachomatis and the host cells at 1 and 24 hours post-infection. Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause a range of mammalian diseases. In humans chlamydiae {{are responsible for the}} most common sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> and trachoma (infectious blindness). Disease arises by adverse host inflammatory reactions that induce tissue damage & scarring. However, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms underlying these outcomes. Chlamydia are genetically intractable as replication outside of the host cell is not yet possible and there are no practical tools for routine genetic manipulation, making genome-scale approaches critical. The early timeframe of infection is poorly understood and the host transcriptional response to chlamydial infection is not well defined. Our simultaneous RNA-Seq method was applied to a simplified in vitro model of chlamydial infection. We discovered a possible chlamydial strategy for early iron acquisition, putative immune dampening effects of chlamydial infection on the host cell, and present a hypothesis for Chlamydia-induced fibrotic scarring through runaway positive feedback loops.

The infected oviduct epithelial cell lines also secreted the immunomodulatory cytokine beta interferon (IFN-β) in a largely MyD 88 -independent manner. Although TLR 3 was the only IFN-β production-capable TLR expressed by the oviduct cell lines, {{we were not able to}} determine whether TLR 3 was responsible for IFN-β production because the epithelial cells were unresponsive to the TLR 3 ligand poly(I-C), and small interfering RNA (siRNA) techniques were ineffective at knocking down TLR 3 expression. To further investigate the potential role of TLR 3 in the infected epithelial cell secretion of IFN-β, we examined the roles of its downstream signaling molecules TRIF and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF- 3) using a dominant-negative TRIF molecule and siRNA specific for TRIF and IRF- 3. Antagonism of either IRF- 3 or TRIF signaling significantly decreased IFN-β production.

Data on these infections are scanty in the Islamic world, especially Kuwait. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among men with symptomatic urethritis in Kuwait. MethodsMen with urethral discharge seen and managed at eight governmental hospitals were recruited into the study. A pair of urethral swab and first-voided urine sample were taken from the patients and sent immediately to the laboratory where they were processed using strand displacement nucleic acid amplification kits (SDA; ProbeTec, Becton Dickinson); one pair per patient was studied. ResultsA total of 426 symptomatic men were studied, out of whom 155 (36. 4 %) were infected by either C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae, or both. The overall prevalence rates of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae were 12. 4 % and 23. 9 %, respectively. There was no significant difference in chlamydial and gonococcal prevalence between Kuwaiti men and non-Kuwaitis (P> 0. 05). Infection rates were much lower in married men than unmarried men.

A series of N-benzyl-substituted 3 '-(R) - 3 '-aminomethyl- 3 '-hydroxy spectinomycins was developed {{on the basis of}} a computational analysis of the aminomethyl spectinomycin binding site and structure-guided synthesis. These compounds had ribosomal inhibition values comparable to spectinomycin but showed increased potency against the common respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis, as well as the sexually transmitted bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Non-ribosome-binding 3 '-(S) isomers of the lead compounds demonstrated weak inhibitory activity in in vitro protein translation assays and poor antibacterial activity, indicating that the antibacterial activity of the series remains on target against the ribosome. Compounds also demonstrated no mammalian cytotoxicity, improved microsomal stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in rats. The lead compound from the series exhibited excellent chemical stability superior to spectinomycin; no interaction with a panel of human receptors and drug metabolism enzymes, suggesting low potential for adverse reactions or drug-drug interactions in vivo; activity in vitro against a panel of penicillin-, macrolide-, and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae clinical isolates; and the ability to cure mice of fatal pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis at a dose of 5 mg/kg.

40|$|Introduction: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection,</b> affecting mainly young, sexually active women. Untreated infection may lead to reproductive complications due to tubal damage. Infections during pregnancy may cause preterm labor, low birth weight, perinatal death, and neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia. There are few data on CT infection in Brazil. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine CT prevalence in infertile and pregnant women. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 77 infertile and 60 asymptomatic pregnant women. First-void urine was tested for CT using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Blood samples were collected for CT IgG antibodies testing using indirect immunofluorescence. A questionnaire about medical, gynecological, and sexual history was completed by all participants. Results: We found statistically similar prevalence of PCR and IgG antibodies between the groups. There was a 61 % prevalence of CT IgG antibodies in infertile women and 56. 7 % in pregnant women. PCR was positive in only one (1. 3 %) infertile woman and in none pregnant women. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of CT IgG antibody in Brazilian pregnant and infertile women, but we found a low prevalence of positive PCR in the urine samples. CT antibodies were associated with sexual behavior and smoking.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis {{continues}} to be the most commonly reported sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection</b> in many countries with more than 100 million new cases estimated annually. These acute infections translate into significant downstream health care costs, particularly for women, where complications can include pelvic inflammatory disease and other disease sequelae such as tubal factor infertility. Despite years of research, the immunological mechanisms responsible for protective immunity versus immunopathology are still not well understood, although it is widely accepted that T cell driven IFN-g and Th 17 responses are critical for clearing infection. While antibodies are able to neutralize infections in vitro, alone they are not protective, indicating that any successful vaccine will need to elicit both arms of the immune response. In recent years, there has been an expansion in the number and types of antigens that have been evaluated as vaccines, and combined with the new array of mucosal adjuvants, this aspect of chlamydial vaccinology is showing promise. Most recently, the opportunities to develop successful vaccines have been given a significant boost with the development of a genetic transformation system for Chlamydia, as well as the identification of the key role of the chlamydial plasmid in virulence.

There is scarce data available referring to the distribution of C. trachomatis genotypes in Argentina. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the genotypes of C. trachomatis circulating in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires (Argentina) associated with ophthalmia neonatorum and genital infections. Findings From 2001 to 2006, 199 positive samples for C. trachomatis infection from symptomatic adult patients and neonates with ophthalmia neonatorum from two public hospitals were studied. C. trachomatis genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP of an ompA fragment. Genotype E was the most prevalent regardless of the sample origin (46. 3 % 57 / 123 in adults and 72. 4 % 55 / 76 in neonates), followed by genotype D (19. 5 % 24 / 123) and F (14. 6 % 18 / 123) in adults, and G (9. 2 % 7 / 76) and D (7. 9 % 6 / 76) in neonates.

We have investigated the role of oviduct contractions in egg transport and found that underlying electrical pacemaker activity is responsible for oviduct motility and egg transport. Specialized pacemaker cells, referred to as oviduct interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-OVI), are responsible for pacemaker activity. The ICC-OVI, labeled with antibodies to KIT protein, form a dense network associated with the smooth muscle cells along {{the entire length of}} the oviduct. Selective removal of ICC-OVI with KIT-neutralizing antibody resulted in loss of electrical rhythmicity and loss of propulsive contractions of the oviduct. We tested whether infection might adversely affect the ICC-OVI. Mice infected with Chlamydia muridarum displayed dilation of oviducts, pyosalpinx, and loss of spontaneous contractile activity. Morphological inspection showed disruption of ICC-OVI networks, and electrophysiological recordings showed loss of intrinsic pacemaker activity without change in basal smooth muscle membrane potential. Chlamydia infection also was associated with upregulation of NOS 2 (iNOS) and PTGS 2 (COX II) in leukocytes. Loss of ICC-OVI and pacemaker activity causes oviduct pseudo-obstruction and loss of propulsive contractions for oocytes. This, accompanied by retention of oviduct secretions, may contribute to the development of tubal factor infertility...|$|E
40|$|Genital chlamydial {{infection}} is a common, {{sexually transmitted infection}} that is often asymptomatic but associated with long term morbidity in a sizeable proportion of women. Early infection can be diagnosed reliably using non-invasive methods and treated effectively with antibiotics. The case for screening in conventional high risk settings (e. g. genito-urinary medicine and termination of pregnancy clinics) is already clear. Screening in the wider community also needs evaluating if {{a significant impact on}} the problem is to be made since {{chlamydial infection}} is widely distributed among young, sexually active people who may have little contact with health services. Studies are in progress to assess the acceptability of different screening approaches to women and men in the community and to compare performance of newer diagnostic techniques. The cost-effectiveness of community-based screening in reducing morbidity needs to be evaluated empirically in randomised trials to encourage a coherent, evidence-based screening policy in this country. In recent years, the control of genital chlamydial infection has emerged as an increasingly important public health problem. This chapter considers available evidence in support of screening, as well as some of the unre-solved issues that need to be addressed before decisions can be made about the appropriateness of implementing a screening programme in the UK. Why consider screening for chlamydial infection? Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection</b> in the UK 1 and uncomplicated infection is easily treated with antibiotics. However, as it often causes no symptoms, most correspondence to: infected individuals are not diagnosed. As previous infection provides n...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Currency notes {{have been}} implicated {{as a vehicle}} for <b>transmitting</b> community-acquired <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> However, the overall {{diversity}} of the bacterial population residing on banknotes is still unknown in Brazil. In this study, we aimed to investigate the overall bacterial population from 150 different Brazilian Rial (R$) notes in circulation using a culture-independent Illumina massively parallel sequencing approach of the 16 S rRNA genes. Samples were randomly collected from three different street markets or “feiras ” in the metropolitan region of São Paulo. Taxonomical composition revealed the abundance of Proteobacteria phyla, followed by Firmicutes and Streptophyta, with a total of 1193 bacterial families and 3310 bacterial genera. Most of these bacterial genera are of human, animal, and environmental origins. Also, our analysis revealed the presence of some potential pathogenic bacterial genera including Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella. The results demonstrate that there is a tremendous diversity of bacterial contamination on currency notes, including organisms known to be opportunistic pathogens. One of the factors that may contribute to the richness of bacterial diversity in currency notes is personal hygiene. Thus, our results underscore the need to increase publi...|$|R

40|$|In our {{everyday}} lives we come into intimate contact with surfaces covered with bacteria (i. e. doorknobs, desktops, children’s toys, etc.). Attachment of a polycationic species with proven bacteriocidal activity onto the target surface may render it antiseptic and therefore unable to <b>transmit</b> <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> Prior endeavors in our laboratory have been directed toward the preparation of antibacterial/antifungal porous surfaces (i. e. cotton cloth, wood, cork, silk and wool). These {{have resulted in the}} discovery and development of a general methodology for the synthesis of porous carbohydrate and protein-based surfaces that exhibit antibacterial and antifungal characteristics which are permanent (i. e. are not removed from the surface by physical means such as washing) and are continuing in their action (i. e. are not consumed by their action against bacteria and/or fungi). In the current proposal we continue to develop this technology toward applications such as wound dressings focusing on maximization of its action and toward control of a variety of organisms. Our work, in collaboration with Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson Wound Management Division, initially involved the modification of alginate wound dressings. During the course of the work we have since geared our efforts to the synthesis of a new type of antibacterial/antifungal surface based on chitosan. The newly synthesized material has been tested (in collaboration with a biologist, Dr. Karin Melkonian, LIU, C. W. Post) and it has proven to kill fungi and bacteria on contact. We continue our efforts towards developing this new chitosan material into a smooth surface so that it may be used as a wound dressing. This project has involved synthetic work as well as molecular identification and characterization techniques. Collaborative efforts {{play a major role in}} our new technology. Our organic team works with a biological team and a variety of private companies that are interested in using our technology. To date, we have licensed out a part of our technology for the use of fabrics (woven and non woven) and are working on yet another agreement with a cosmetic applicator company on manufacturing antibacterial/antifungal brushes, applicators, and wigs. We are continuing our work towards the production of antimicrobial wound dressings. It is our hope that our technology may aid a variety of people in a variety of ways...|$|R
