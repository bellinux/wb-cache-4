5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of <b>the</b> <b>Permanent</b> Fund, and it passed <b>the</b> <b>Permanent</b> Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>Permanent</b> Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to <b>the</b> <b>Permanent</b> Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike <b>the</b> <b>Permanent</b> Fund.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the overjet and {{overbite}} behavior during eruption of <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> incisors. Fourth-eight plaster casts of 16 patients from ages 6 - 13 years were appraised longitudinally. It was found that the overjet remains constant, starting at the eruption of <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> central incisors until eruption of <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> canine teeth, while the overbite increases after eruption of <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> lateral incisors and remains constant with the eruption of the canine teeth...|$|R

40|$|Previously, <b>the</b> graph <b>permanent</b> was {{introduced}} as a single-valued invariant for graphs G with |E(G) | = k(|V(G) |- 1) for some k ∈Z_> 0. Herein, we construct <b>the</b> extended graph <b>permanent,</b> an infinite sequence for all graphs. We prove that, like <b>the</b> graph <b>permanent,</b> <b>the</b> extended graph <b>permanent</b> is invariant under the graph operations {{that are known}} to preserve the period. Further, the original construction and extension arise from permanents of matrices, but we construct a novel graph polynomial such that the sequence can be generated from the point count of this polynomial, as a residue over prime-order finite fields.
