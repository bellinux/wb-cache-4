For 15 years, the Brigade {{served as}} the principal construction brigade for the United States Army, Europe and 7th Army. During this period, the Brigade performed numerous construction, rehabilitation and renovation missions in military communities and training areas of the 7th Army. These included an extensive range upgrade of the Grafenwohr Major <b>Training</b> <b>Area</b> in the early 1980s {{and the construction of}} the Range 23 complex at the Wildflecken Major <b>Training</b> <b>Area</b> in 1989 and 1990.

5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List.

Additionally, the burning of waste also created problems, in addition to the use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire <b>training</b> <b>area</b> also needed clean up, as materials were burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.|$|E
40|$|The U. S.

The new SUA would be adjacent to existing Class C and Class E airspace for El Paso International Airport. The existing Restricted Airspace R- 5103 A would be extended south to the Texas/New Mexico state line to align with the edge of Fort Bliss property. Purpose The purpose of the Proposed Action is to accommodate new training requirements and increased air traffic associated with the establishment of a Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) at Fort Bliss in 2012, as well as other aviation units, and to increase air traffic safety over live-fire areas, drop zones, shoot houses, munitions loading areas, and terrain flying areas in the South <b>Training</b> <b>Areas</b> and McGregor Range <b>Training</b> <b>Areas</b> 8 and 9.

5|$|Scouting in {{the former}} Rhodesia and Nyasaland started in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered.

In 1959, Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree at Ruwa. In 2009, Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Zimbabwe and hundreds of Scouts camped at Gordon Park, a Scout campground and <b>training</b> <b>area,</b> as part of these celebrations.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade {{was located}} in Southport, Queensland. As of 1 June, the brigade had a {{strength}} of 4,719 men and {{was scheduled to be}} ready for offensive operations by October that year. During June it also established a <b>training</b> <b>area</b> at Nerang in Queensland, where armoured units could practice operating in tropical conditions. In September 1944 the brigade gained the 2/1st Armoured Brigade Reconnaissance Squadron when the 1st Armoured Brigade Group was disbanded; this unit was reorganised to become the Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) in January 1945. The 2/6th Armoured Regiment was also reassigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade, but was stationed in the Sydney area. Following the disbandment of the 1st Armoured Brigade Group the 4th Armoured Brigade was the last remaining armoured brigade in the Australian Army.|$|E

The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Pressure {{from land}} {{development}} and an encroaching human population reduced {{the range and}} the number of the Kaimanawa horses, and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained. Starting in 1981, the Kaimanawa population, range size, and herd movements began to be officially measured, and a protected area was formed for the breed in the Waiouru Military <b>Training</b> <b>Area.</b> Legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species. There was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed, and 1,576 horses were known to exist in the area by 1994. There is also a small population of horses on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island, which is mostly unmanaged by the New Zealand government. In 2008, the Kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called Kaimanawa Princess, by Dianne Haworth.|$|E

Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert <b>Training</b> <b>Area</b> and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.|$|E

40|$|Military <b>training</b> <b>areas</b> {{are used}} by armed forces as <b>training</b> territories. These <b>areas</b> are exposed to {{intensive}} anthropogenic disturbances. It may seem paradoxical {{that a number of}} studies had shown that on those particular areas is often present remarkably high biodiversity and numerous species of conservation concern. In this respect, military <b>training</b> <b>areas</b> are more valuable than most parts of surrounding landscape and thus form true biodiversity refuges. Particularly important are those areas for open habitats species. There are two main causes of uniqueness of military <b>training</b> <b>areas.</b> First, they are closed for any human activities not connected to military training. Because of this, these areas were not exposed to negative influences such as agricultural intensification or urbanization. Second, military activities create very heterogeneous habitat mosaic. This allows coexistence of many species with different ecological requirements. However, biota of military <b>training</b> <b>areas</b> is currently endangered due to abandonment by armed forces caused by downsizing national troops. The end of unique disturbance regime caused by military training leads to gradual homogenization of landscape mosaic and therefore to population decline of habitat specialists. Subsequent commercial development of these areas is another [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{moved up}} to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and {{remained}} there until the division was withdrawn to a <b>training</b> <b>area</b> in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps.

Although Russell blamed himself for {{the outcome of the}} attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence {{he made it clear that}} planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did not take into account the poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|The International Zone {{served as}} {{the hub of the}} Games Village, {{offering}} retail and entertainment services as well as a rendezvous location for visitors and Games participants.

The <b>Training</b> <b>Area,</b> a zonal area by itself with an area of , provided training facilities entirely within the Games Village, in what {{has been described as a}} first in the history of the Commonwealth Games.

Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
