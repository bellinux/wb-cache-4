5|$|The {{populations of}} nilgai in India are so large <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> {{in the states}} of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have pleaded to the {{government}} to cull them. Nilgai herds raid and trample crop fields across these states, often causing food shortages.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E
5|$|A {{delegation}} of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting {{the acquisition of}} their property on 23 November 1942, and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting at which they agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values {{than those of the}} ORD appraisers, but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued the use of this method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture. It found that the appraisals had been fair and just, and <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> had overestimated the size and productivity of their land.|$|E

60|$|For two {{or three}} days the same thing happened. By this time, Whitefoot had lost all fear. He knew <b>that</b> <b>Farmer</b> Brown's boy would not harm him, and it was not long before he ventured to take a bit of food from Farmer Brown's boy's hand. After <b>that</b> <b>Farmer</b> Brown's boy took care that no crumbs should be {{scattered}} on the ground. Whitefoot had to come to him for his food, and always Farmer Brown's boy had something delicious for him.|$|R
5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since the bombing, scientists, {{security}} experts, and the ATF have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, Honeywell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{legislation}} tail docking {{may only be}} used as a last resort. The law provides <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> must first take measures to improve the pigsâ€™ conditions and, only where these have failed to prevent tail biting, may they tail dock.|$|E

25|$|In {{rural areas}} {{it is common}} <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> are known by the {{traditional}} name of their Hof (farm or estate). Because of the long-standing tradition of impartible inheritance in German-speaking Europe, ownership of a Hof had often been tied to direct patrilineal descent over centuries.|$|E
25|$|The CSA {{estimated}} in 2005 <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> in Dire Dawa {{had a total}} 40,400 head of cattle (representing 0.1% of Ethiopia's total), 46,280 sheep (0.27%), 118,770 goats (0.92%), 8,820 asses (0.35%), 5,070 camels (1.11%), 44,740 poultry of all species (0.14%), and 840 beehives (less than 0.1%).|$|E
25|$|The Fordson {{succeeded in}} being cheaper to {{maintain}} than horses, as the Ford Model T had previously done. A government test concluded <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> spent $.95 per acre plowing with a Fordson compared to feeding eight horses {{for a year}} and paying two drivers, which cost $1.46 per acre.|$|E

25|$|Within countries, {{capital and}} labor can be reinvested and reemployed to produce {{different}} outputs. Similar to Ricardo's comparative advantage argument, this {{is assumed to}} happen without cost. If the two production technologies are the arable industry and the fishing industry it is assumed <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> can shift to work as fishermen with no cost and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|A climate shift with colder weather {{started about}} 500 BC. The forests, which had {{previously}} consisted of elm, lime, ash and oak, were replaced with birch, pine and spruce. The climate changes also meant <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> started building more structures for shelter. Knowledge of ironworking was introduced from the Celts, resulting in better weapons and tools.|$|E
25|$|This {{sheep and}} lamb fair {{was the first}} of the year in Sussex, and there was much interest. It is said <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> from as far afield as Hastings to the east and Findon to the west visited, and at its peak, more than 9000 lambs were sold at the fair, {{together}} with numerous horses, cattle and sheep.|$|E

25|$|Public {{concerns}} {{have resulted in}} demand and egg prices falling throughout the country. Prices at a large Beijing wholesale market dropped 10%, and prices fell by 10% the day after news of the contamination broke in Hong Kong. Wholesalers have refused stock products without melamine inspection certificates. The Beijing Youth Daily reported <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> {{have been forced to}} slaughter tens of thousands of chickens.|$|E
25|$|Recently {{there have}} been moves towards organic farming {{in an attempt to}} sustain profits, and many farmers {{supplement}} their income by diversifying activities away from pure agriculture. Biofuels present new opportunities for farmers against a background of rising fears about fossil fuel prices, energy security, and climate change. There is increasing awareness <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> have an important role to play as custodians of the British countryside and wildlife.|$|E

50|$|This was Farmer's {{second album}} as leader for Argo, {{and the first}} {{recording}} on which he played only flugelhorn. The three other musicians were {{all part of the}} Jazztet, a sextet <b>that</b> <b>Farmer</b> co-led.|$|R
25|$|At a time {{of world}} food shortages, it was vital <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> {{produced}} the maximum possible quantities. The government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the National Agricultural Advisory Service provided expertise and price guarantees. As {{a result of the}} Attlee Government's initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20% increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while Britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.|$|E
25|$|If global price {{movements}} are transmitted to local markets, {{farmers in the}} developing world could benefit from the rising price of food. According to researchers from the Overseas Development Institute, this may depend on farmers' capacity to respond to changing market conditions. Experience suggests <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> lack the credit and inputs needed to respond in the short term. In the medium or long term, however, they could benefit, as seen in the Asian Green Revolution or in many African countries in the recent past.|$|E
25|$|Since Neolithic {{times in}} China, {{agriculture}} {{was a key}} element {{to the rise of}} China's civilization and every other civilization. The food <b>that</b> <b>farmers</b> produced sustained the whole of society, while the land tax exacted on farmers' lots and landholders' property produced much of the state revenue for China's pre-modern ruling dynasties. Therefore, the farmer was a valuable member of society, and even though he was not considered one with the shi class, the families of the shi were still landholders that often produced crops and foodstuffs.|$|E
