40|$|Many {{applications}} of modern electronic devices {{are based on}} thin film geometries including sharp <b>turns,</b> <b>holes</b> and exhibiting inhomogeneities. The inevitable detour of current streamlines around such obstacles cause an inhomogeneous current density profile giving rise to current crowding. The goal of my research is to highlight the current crowding effects in micro and nanopatterned superconducting films...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Turn</b> <b>Hole</b> Tunnel is an {{abandoned}} railroad tunnel near Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. Built by the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, it carried {{part of the}} Lehigh and Susquehanna RR main line until 1912, and was used {{as part of a}} passing siding for several decades thereafter. It is now an attraction in Lehigh Gorge State Park.|$|R
50|$|The CNJ {{main line}} through Lehigh Gorge was {{abandoned}} in late 1965. While {{most of it}} has become the Lehigh Gorge Trail, the new alignment around <b>Turn</b> <b>Hole</b> Tunnel was paved as an access road to the Glen Onoko trail head of Lehigh Gorge State Park. The tunnel remains largely intact, with ties from the double track remaining in situ, occasionally covered by rockfall. At the north portal, overlooking the river, a safety railing has been built across the tunnel. The piers of the old bridge still stand in the river.|$|R

5000|$|The tunnel {{takes its}} name from the [...] "Turn Hole" [...] in the Lehigh River, a deep eddy where the river makes a turn {{at the base of a}} high cliff, known as Moyer's Rock. When the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (a {{subsidiary}} of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company) extended its line from White Haven to Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe) in 1866, it crossed the Lehigh River at the <b>Turn</b> <b>Hole</b> and tunneled 496 ft through the face of the cliff, proceeding southward through the gorge. The parallel line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad crossed the river just to the west, but swung around the point of Moyer's Rock instead of tunneling. The Lehigh and Susquehanna was leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1871.|$|R

Coil housing constructed for mechanical strength to hold coil against magnetic force, to maintain electrical contact with coil ends, {{and to maintain}} insulation between coil <b>turns.</b> Drilled <b>holes</b> placed to facilitate release of bubbles during potting. In contrast with mechanical hammers, electromagnetic hammer requires no dynamic material contact with workpiece; consequently, produces almost no change in metal grain structure...|$|R

5000|$|A tuz {{cannot be}} made {{if it is}} {{symmetrical}} to the opponent's one (for instance, if the opponent's third hole is a tuz, you cannot <b>turn</b> your third <b>hole</b> into one). It is permitted {{to make such a}} move, but it wouldn't create a tuz.|$|R

60|$|Knots at End of Rope.--To make a {{large knot}} {{at the end}} of a piece of string, to prevent it from pulling through a <b>hole,</b> <b>turn</b> the end of the string back upon itself, so as to make it double, and then tie a common knot. The string may be quadrupled instead of doubled, if required.|$|R
60|$|Now {{when the}} King found {{himself at the}} bottom of the hole he at first did not know what to do; so he sat down and thought about it. Presently a happy idea came into his head. He knew if only he was at the other end of the hole, he would be at the top instead of the bottom, and could make his escape. So the King took hold of the hole, and exerting all his strength, <b>turned</b> the <b>hole</b> upside down. Being now at the top he stepped upon the ground and walked back to the palace, where he caught Prince Zingle milking the cow with the golden horns.|$|R
40|$|Proposed set {{of tools}} neatly dimple cup washer to prevent screw from <b>turning</b> in {{mounting}} <b>hole.</b> Two dimples required, one leaning outward to grip recess in mounting hole and one leaning inward to grip recess in screw-head. Tools do not cause cracks and tears. Substitute die-forming process for hammer-and-center-punch process. De-forming process requires less skill and gives results of greater quality and consistency...|$|R
50|$|Pills do not {{interfere}} with the functionality of the textile, unless a spot with a lot of pills <b>turns</b> into a <b>hole</b> in the fabric. This is because both pills and holes are caused by the fabric wearing—a pill is fibre that was in the cloth. After the pill forms the fabric is thinner there, increasing the likelihood that a hole will form.|$|R
50|$|In the playoff, the {{two were}} tied at three-under after 16 holes, {{following}} January's birdie. Both had pars at the 17th, which effectively <b>turned</b> the 18th <b>hole</b> into sudden-death. Both tee shots found fairway bunkers, and Barber hit a 3-iron onto the green, 18 ft from the cup. January found another bunker short of the green and could not save par from 15 ft.|$|R

40|$|Hawking {{effect from}} a {{dynamical}} Kerr black hole is investigated using the improved Damour-Ruffini method {{with a new}} tortoise coordinate transformation. Hawking temperature of the black hole can be obtained point by point at the event horizon. It is found that Hawking temperatures of different points on the surface are different.

50|$|Pandora's Box was unlocked, and Dylan finds another {{staff in}} it, and {{uses it to}} <b>turn</b> a <b>hole</b> in the ground, which opens a {{trapdoor}} with an extremely long ladder. Dylan climbs down the ladder, and tries to look for Buck. He gets lost, {{and there are still}} tremors, and he discovers money in the caves under the cabin. He yells for help, and Buck and an adult Sasquatch find him. Buck admits that he is D. B. Cooper to Dylan Hickock. He says he committed the hijacking to pay for cancer treatments for his son. He also says that his wife Betty had told Billy to stash the money in the cabin. Buck had also talked to Dylan's dad though the radio by setting up a code.|$|R

However, these holes do not significantly increase the range resolution value {{as shown in}} [9]. Consequently, we have to choose (b_i)_i= 1 ^N as the complementarity sequence of (a_i)_i= 1 ^N and the vector b can be define as b=[a̅_ 1,a̅_ 2,...,a̅_N] with a̅_i= 1 -a_i.

40|$|Nonextreme {{black hole}} in a {{canonical}} or grand canonical ensemble can approach the extreme limit at a finite temperature. It is shown that, in spite of it, one-loop contribution of quantum fields to the thermodynamic entropy due to equilibrium Hawking radiation exactly equals zero. The {{same is true for}} the finite temperature version of the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime into which a Reissner-Nordstrom black <b>hole</b> <b>turns</b> in the extreme limit. The obtained result is attributed to the nature of a horizon for the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime...|$|R
40|$|In this Letter {{we present}} the {{construction}} of the Maxwell equal-area law in the Hawking temperature graph for a charged black hole in Anti-de Sitter background. We are able to find exact solution for the corresponding isotherm and entropies for “gaseous” (large) black holes and “liquid” (near-extremal) black holes. Isothermal construction removes the unphysical, negative heat capacity, regions. Furthermore, extremal black <b>holes</b> <b>turn</b> out to be dual to un-shrinkable molecules of Van der Waals real fluid, which may explain their thermodynamical stability...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{evolution}} of the massless scalar field propagating in time-dependent charged Vaidya black hole background. A generalized tortoise coordinate transformation were used to study {{the evolution of the}} massless scalar field. It is shown that, for the slowest damped quasinormal modes, the approximate formulae in stationary Reissner-Nordström black <b>hole</b> <b>turn</b> out to be a reasonable prescription, showing that results from quasinormal mode analysis are rather robust.

40|$|Kinect depth maps often contain missing data, or “holes”, {{for various}} reasons. Most {{existing}} Kinect-related research treat these holes as artifacts {{and try to}} minimize {{them as much as}} possible. In this paper, we advocate a to-tally different idea – <b>turning</b> Kinect <b>holes</b> into useful infor-mation. In particular, we are interested in the unique type of holes that are caused by occlusion of the Kinect’s struc-tured light, resulting in shadows and loss of depth acquisi-tion. We propose a robust detection scheme to detect and classify different types of shadows based on their distinct local shadow patterns as determined from geometric anal-ysis, without assumption on object geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve very accurate shadow detection. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the extracted shadow information by success-fully applying it for automatic foreground segmentation. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{event horizon}} {{of a black}} hole may {{be thought of as a}} surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between {{escaping}} and falling back. The event horizon of a white hole is a surface moving inward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between being swept outward and succeeding in reaching the center. They are two different kinds of horizons—the horizon of a white hole is like the horizon of a black <b>hole</b> <b>turned</b> inside-out.|$|R

40|$|We {{apply the}} {{traveling}} wavelets method {{to investigate the}} large scale structures formation in cosmology. In particular we test {{the stability of the}} linear (evolution) regime in a plane symmetric case. As a result, our analysis confirms the existence of such a behavior in some configurations of fields describing the evolution of cosmological structures. However, we also exhibit other configurations for which the linear approximation is not valid at any time. In particular, density defaults (i. e. <b>holes)</b> <b>turns</b> out to be highly non-linear structures which dominate the evolution...|$|R

40|$|We {{simulate}} stationary {{current distribution}} in graphene ribbons {{in the presence}} of top gate potentials, by means of the nonequilibrium Keldysh–Green's function formalism within a tight-binding model. In the absence of magnetic fields and {{in the presence of}} a model potential barrier, we observe the Klein paradox, where electrons <b>turn</b> into <b>holes</b> in the gated region and again into electrons beyond it. We establish a connection between the band structure at the corner points of the Brillouin zone and Klein paradox, and give a pictorial description of conductive channels. In the presence of high magnetic fields, transport currents are chiral and flow along the edges of the ribbon. The intensity and sign of the potential barrier with respect to the Fermi energy influence the nature (electron/hole) of the carriers inside the gated region and determine the edge involved in the transport process. We demonstrate that manipulation of currents in the ribbon can be obtained by external gates...|$|R
