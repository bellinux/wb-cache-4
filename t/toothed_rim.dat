50|$|The {{centrally}} positioned eyepiece {{is for the}} viewfinder. An external mechanism, {{hidden inside}} the protrusion at the left-hand side of the lens/shutter assembly, relays the front lens element extension to the rangefinder optics by sensing {{the height of a}} milled cam at the periphery of the lens barrel just behind the <b>toothed</b> <b>rim.</b> Both the separate viewfinder and rangefinder eyepieces and the lens coupling are {{in the style of the}} Leica camera. The difference is the way in which the lever operates on the lens barrel. Looking through the small rangefinder window at the left-hand side at the back reveals a clear view of a horizontally split image. The lower image part is shifted sideways by turning the focusing wheel at the front right-hand side of the lens. By aligning the vertical feature of any object in the motive that crosses the split in the rangefinder image may render it sharp on the film.|$|E
50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large tensioning pulley (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a <b>toothed</b> <b>rim,</b> mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of {{a stop on the}} mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{paper is}} one of a series {{describing}} work aimed at comparing and eval-uating various standard methods for the mechanical testing of laminated composites. The work is based on test methods specified by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the Composites Research Advisory Group (CRAG). Previous papers [1, 2] describe the use of these methods for testing carbon fibre and glass fibre reinforced plastics composites respectively. The current paper describes the extension of the earlier work to cover "Kevlar " fibre reinforced plastics (KFRP). Tests were made in tension, compression and flexure modes; the standard tests used here evaluated the strength and stiffness of the laminates studied. It was found that although the recommendations of the standards by the three institutes are broadly similar a number of substantial differences arose in the results. 1. SPECIMEN PREPARATION HE &dquo;KEVLAR&dquo; FIBRE used was in the form of bi-directional woven fabric fromT DuPont (K- 285) (Crowfoot satin style) impregnated with resin from Cyanamid (Cycom- 919). Each ply thickness was 0. 25 mm and the laminates were 8 plies (2 mm) thick. The material was laid up and cured in an autoclave to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Two lay-ups were used: 0 / 90 ° and 45 /- 45 °. In the present case specimens were cut using a high speed diamond impreg-nated circular saw with water cooling. Saws made specifically for &dquo;Kevlar&dquo; were used: these have a <b>toothed</b> <b>rim</b> with spaces between the teeth that allow clearance of debris. The specimens were finished by using fine emery paper when wet. Some compressive testpieces required a waisted centre section (e. g. the ASTM *To whom all correspondence should be addresse...|$|E
50|$|Mining {{applications}} {{often require}} high preloads, and joints encounter high dynamic forces, {{which can cause}} joints to loosen. MJTs can keep joints tight on boom points, ring gears, side frames, hoist motors, drag lines, pinion gears, split gears, and excavator bearing caps, because the joint is loaded in pure tension without twisting. Some applications, such as <b>toothed</b> <b>rims,</b> require short bolts - MJTs {{can be useful in}} these applications because they greatly improve the elasticity of the joint.|$|R
50|$|Like other bobtail squid, {{southern}} dumpling squid have a light organ fuelled by symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria. The light organ, {{which is}} butterfly-shaped, {{is situated in}} the mantle cavity and is used to cancel out the bobtail squid's silhouette. There are large semi-circular fins on the rear half of the mantle. Although they can change colour, they are usually an iridescent green or yellow with brown spots. The bobtail squid have four rows of suckers on each arm and both their arms and tentacles are armed with <b>toothed</b> horny <b>rim.</b>|$|R
