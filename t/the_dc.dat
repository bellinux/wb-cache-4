40|$|The {{conceptual}} design of user interfaces {{focuses on the}} specification {{of the structure of}} the dialog, independent of any particular implementation approach.

30|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of the observed}} immune enhancement are unclear at this stage. One hypothesis is that GO may serve as an immune adjuvant, which can activate <b>the</b> <b>DCs</b> and induce a more potent immune response. However, the data of {{this study showed that}} GO alone did not generate significant immune modulatory effects, a behavior inconsistent with most immune adjuvants (Figure  3 A). Another possible mechanism is that GO may function as a carrier of the antigens for crossing the cell membrane [36] and thus bring more antigen into <b>the</b> <b>DCs.</b> Presumably more glioma antigens will be processed within <b>the</b> <b>DCs,</b> leading to an improved DC-mediated anti-glioma response. Obviously, extensive future studies are still warranted to unveil the immune-modulating {{mechanisms of}} GO.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{integrated}} model is {{proposed for the}} location inventory routing problem under uncertainty. This problem involves determining the location of distribution centers (DCs) in a three echelon supply chain. <b>The</b> <b>DCs</b> receive orders from the customer and according to a continuous review inventory replenishment policy place orders to the supplier. The products are directly shipped from the supplier to <b>the</b> <b>DCs.</b> <b>The</b> vehicles start from <b>the</b> <b>DCs</b> to fulfill <b>the</b> demands of the customers. Determining the routing of the vehicles {{is one of the}} decisions involved in this problem. The demands of customers are stochastically distributed and <b>the</b> capacity of <b>DCs</b> are limited. If one of <b>the</b> <b>DCs</b> undergo a disruption and is unable to fulfill the demands of the customers, shortage may occur. Moreover in the proposed model the shortage is considered as partial backlogging. This means that if shortage occurs, some of the orders result in lost sales and other orders are fulfilled in the next period. In order to optimally solve the proposed model a nonlinear integer programming (INLP) model is developed. However, since the problem is NP-hard, the mathematical formulation cannot be efficiently solved for large sized instances of the problem. Therefore an outer approximation method is developed to solve the problem more efficiently. The computational results show the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R
