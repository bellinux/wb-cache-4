50|$|The Club Protection Program, {{initially}} put {{in place}} at the expense of UEFA to cover the UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland/Ukraine, has since been taken over at FIFA's expense following the approval by the FIFA Congress in Budapest in May 2012. It now covers all clubs that release players for A-national teal matches listed on the International Match Calendar, including a FIFA commitment to insure the football tournament of the Olympic Games.The Club Protection Program provides compensation for clubs in the event that national A-team players participating for their national association suffer a <b>temporary</b> total <b>disablement</b> (TTD) as a result of bodily injuries caused by an accident. Players are insured up to a maximum of one year from the day of the excess period (= date of injury + 27 days) and a maximum of €7,500,000.|$|R
6000|$|... 11. In {{legislation}} and social organization, proceed {{on the principle}} that invalids, meaning persons who cannot keep themselves alive by their own activities, cannot, beyond reason, expect to be kept alive by the activity of others. There is a point at which the most energetic policeman or doctor, when called upon to deal with an apparently drowned person, gives up artificial respiration, although it is never possible to declare with certainty, at any point short of decomposition, that another five minutes of the exercise would not effect resuscitation. The theory that every individual alive is of infinite value is legislatively impracticable. No doubt the higher the life we secure to the individual by wise social organization, the greater his value is to the community, and the more pains we shall take to pull him through any <b>temporary</b> danger or <b>disablement.</b> But the man who costs more than he is worth is doomed by sound hygiene as inexorably as by sound economics.|$|R
40|$|Replacement demand due {{to regular}} and early retirement, <b>disablement,</b> <b>temporary</b> {{withdrawals}} of women owing to birth and child raising, et cetera, constitutes {{an important element}} of the future demand for newcomers on the labour market. It is, however, often neglected in manpower forecasting studies. In this paper, we develop a flow model with which we can forecast the replacement demand at a detailed level of types of education. The essential element of the model is the determination of the yearly outflow coefficients for each type of education, distinguished by age category and gender. Instead of applying a fixed coefficient approach (Willems and De Grip (1993), we will introduce the random coefficient estimation technique in the model. This technique takes the reliability of the flow coefficients explicitly into account. If a specific flow coefficient is unreliable, the random coefficient estimate will tend towards the mean value for that age category over the types of education. This means that ad hoc corrections based on judgmental forecasting can be considerably reduced. Moreover, it will be shown that the random coefficient estimates of labour market outflow are more reliable than the estimates of the Willems/De Grip model. ...|$|R

50|$|The Battle of Ticinus was {{a battle}} of the Second Punic War fought between the Carthaginian forces of Hannibal and the Romans under Publius Cornelius Scipio in November 218 BC. The battle {{took place in the}} flat country of Pavia county on the right bank of the Ticino River, not far north from its {{confluence}} (from the north) with the Po River. The battle is named from the river, not the nearby contemporaneous settlement of Ticinum (today's Pavia). Although the precise location is not known, it is generally accepted that a settlement known today as Vigevano is mentioned in Livy's text and that Scipio's camp was to the south at Gambolo, whose coordinates are given on the map. The conflict would have been west of there. It was the first battle of the war against the Romans that was fought on Italian soil and the first battle of the war to employ legion-sized forces. Its loss by the Romans, and the <b>temporary</b> <b>disablement</b> of Scipio's command, {{set the stage for the}} Roman disaster at the Battle of Trebbia in December.|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} comprehensive hygienic {{examination of}} working conditions in greenhouses at a greenhouse complex in Saratov region. Our research {{goal was to}} a priori assess occupational health risk for greenhouse workers {{on the basis of}} working conditions classification as per deviations of environment parameters and working process from the existing hygienic standards. We examined microclimate parameters in cold and warm seasons, contamination or working area air with hazardous chemicals and aerosols; we also performed occupational and time studies of work activities when basic working tasks were accomplished during an annual vegetables growing cycle in greenhouses. We detected that green-house workers during their working activity were exposed to a set of hazardous factors; the prevailing ones were heating microclimate, occurrence of hazardous chemicals and dust in increased concentrations in working area air, hardness of labor process which involved excessive physical exercise, long-term work in an inconvenient posture, frequent body bend-ings, and necessity {{to spend a lot of}} time standing. Overall hygienic assessment of greenhouse working conditions corre-sponded to 3 degree category of hazardous conditions (3. 3 danger class) allowing for impacts exerted by a set of hazard-ous working environment factors and working process itself during annual working cycle. Hazardous working conditions caused occupational health risk for greenhouse workers which, in conformity with R 2. 21766 - 03, corresponded to high (intolerable) risk when urgent activities aimed at its reduction were to be accomplished. Our research result prove that it is vital to perform further research on greenhouse workers health as per data on periodical medical examinations, more profound study of morbidity with <b>temporary</b> <b>disablement,</b> and other socially significant health parameters...|$|E
40|$|I {{studied a}} {{potential}} function and underlying mechanism(s) {{of the magnetic}} sense in honey bees, Apis mellifera. A waggle-dancing bee informs hive mates about a food source. Directional information pointing to the food source relative to the sun 2 ̆ 7 s azimuth is encoded in the angle between the straight segment of her waggle dance and a reference line such as gravity or the local geomagnetic field (LGMF). Neither cancelling the LGMF nor shifting its declination affected the recruitment success of waggle-dancing bees, implicating gravity as the reference line for the dance alignment. To study the underlying mechanism(s) of the bees’ magnetic sense, I analyzed lyophilized and pelletized bee tagmata by a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. A distinct hysteresis loop for the abdomen {{but not for the}} thorax or the head of bees indicated the presence of magnetite in the abdomen. Magnetic remanence of abdomen pellets produced from bees that I did, or did not, expose to an NdFeB magnet while alive differed, indicating that magnet-exposure altered the magnetization of this magnetite in live bees. Following exposure of live bees to the same magnet, magnetized bees, unlike sham-treated control bees, failed to sense the presence of a magnetic anomaly, demonstrating a functional connection between magnetite in the abdomen and the magnetoreceptor, and <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>disablement</b> of the receptor through magnet-exposure. To test whether bees sense the polarity of a magnetic field, I trained bees to associate a magnetic anomaly with a sugar water reward. I then presented trained bees with a sugar water reward in two separate watch glasses, placing one reward {{in the center of the}} anomaly that I either kept the same as during bee training (control experiment) or that I altered by reversing its polarity (treatment experiment). That bees continued to recognize the magnetic anomaly when its polarity was kept unaltered, but failed to recognize it when its polarity was reversed, indicates that bees have a polarity-sensitive magnetoreceptor. To increase the detectability of magnetite in bee tissues, I lyophilized samples to reduce water content, maximized the signal amplitude by pelletizing samples, and accounted for sample dimensions in data analyses...|$|R
40|$|The paper defends three {{claims about}} Aristotle’s theory of {{uncontrolled}} (akratic) actions in NE 7. 3. First, I {{argue that the}} first part of NE 7. 3 (1146 b 30 - 47 a 24) contains the description of the overall state of mind of the agent while she acts without control. Aristotle’s {{solution to the problem of}} uncontrolled action lies in the analogy between the uncontrolled agent and people who are drunk, mad, or asleep. This analogy is interpreted as meaning that the uncontrolled agent, while acting without control, is still in possession of her knowledge (and so she can make use of what she knows) but she is unable to use it as knowledge due to the <b>temporary</b> <b>disablement</b> of her reason by appetite. Due to this disablement, the uncontrolled agent is temporarily unable to be motivated to act by her knowledge and acts merely on her appetite. Second, I argue that the second part of NE 7. 3 (1147 a 25 -b 5) provides an analysis of the particular mental state from which the uncontrolled action issues. Its central passage (1147 a 31 - 5) is a description of the uncontrolled agent’s state of mind before the uncontrolled action and not, as it has been traditionally understood, a description of her state of mind during the uncontrolled action. Third, I argue that, on Aristotle’s view, the transition from the state before the uncontrolled action to the state in which the agent already acts without control does not involve any psychological state that would constitute the agent’s choice to abandon her decision and give in to her desires but proceeds on a purely physiological level...|$|E
