40|$|Aim: To explore {{relevant}} and important aspects concerning child maltreatment (CM) {{as found in}} treatment files and to verify the relation of these aspects with social workers perceived and nonperceived CM. Relations between documented CM {{in different parts of}} the treatment files are studied. Methods: From a database of 843 treatment files 72 were selected by the <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinator</b> and the head of the out-patient unit on the basis of perceived CM. Digital files could not be found for 19 files and another 53 files were randomly added to the sample, which ultimately consisted of 106 files. The files were blindly assessed on containing words and sentences about CM, based on an extensive definition of the phenomenon. Aspects to be explored were frequencies of CM incidents, CM types, offenders, level of gravity, risk factors and verbalization of CM. Relations between different parts of the treatment files were analysed using Spearman’s correlations. Results: CM was found to be overlooked by the social workers in 30 % of the files. The most common type of CM was children witnessing domestic violence, followed by emotional maltreatment and sexual abuse. Sexual abuse and children witnessing domestic violence have been found to be significantly more perceived by the <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinator.</b> Severe as well as less severe incidents of CM were found to be overlooked by the coordinator for every type of CM except sexual abuse. Perceived CM files were found to contain more words about unspecified types of CM than did non-perceived files. Found risk factors for different types of CM are gender, children’s skill, parental psychological problems, parental drugs and alcohol abuse, parental history of maltreatment, financial problems and violent interactions within the family. Frequencies of documented CM were found to vary substantially between different parts of the treatment files. Small but significant correlations were found for the verbalization of CM between the different parts of the files and were strongest for sexual abuse. Conclusions: Treatment files contain a great deal of relevant information concerning CM and associated aspects. More attention should be drawn to perceiving and treating child maltreatment adequately...|$|E

Very few efforts have been made to determine how the patients value the adult education programs that are provided for them by residential mental health facilities. Similarly, very few efforts have been made toward soliciting input from the <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinators</b> concerning their views on the value of these educational programs to the patients' overall treatment and rehabilitation process. Therefore, the purpose of this case study was to provide an in-depth analysis on how the patients and the <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinators</b> (who are responsible for linking patients to the various institutional adult education programs at Chicago Read Mental Health Center) actually valued the learning activities. The results of this study revealed that both patients and <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinators</b> support C. Goldin and J. Thomas's 1984 contention that the facility's adult education programs act as a vehicle for enhancing the patients' functional potential. However, they identify different views that relate to their understanding of this concept. Accordingly, while patients emphasized learning activities that focused on providing patients with skills that enhance their ability to live independently, <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinators</b> referred more to those that increase patients' chances for staying out of the hospital. From this point of view, the emphasis was on decreasing recidivism opposed to enhancing the possibility for a quality lifestyle. The results of this study also revealed that both patients and <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinators</b> contended that adult education programs were used as a form of social control. Contrary to the viewpoint held by M. Collins in 1988 and P. Rabinow in 1984, which maintains that social control is an evil force that drives patients deeper into their disability, patients and <b>treatment</b> <b>coordinators</b> view its practice as being an integral part of enhancing patients' ability to function effectively. While it was clear that patients recognized the value of using the adult education programs as a form of social control, it was not clear if the patients themselves actually saw the benefit of social control or if they had internalized the values of the institution. A study of this nature is significant because it provides information that can be useful to planning quality adult education programs that address patient-centered needs...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate whether}} human subjects {{are willing to}} give up individual freedom in return for the benefits of improved coordination. We conduct a modified iterated public goods game in which subjects in each period first decide which of two groups to join. One group employs a voluntary contribution mechanism, the other group an allocator contribution mechanism. The setup of the allocator mechanism differs between two <b>treatments.</b> In the <b>coordinator</b> <b>treatment,</b> the randomly selected allocator can set a uniform contribution for all group members, including herself. In the dictator treatment, the allocator can choose different contributions for herself and all other group members. We find that subjects willingly submit to authority in both treatments, even when competing with a voluntary contribution mechanism. The allocator groups achieve high contribution levels in both treatments...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} details {{the range of}} activities which have been undertaken within the Ballyfermot LDATF region in 2016 {{as part of the}} SWAT (Supporting Women to Access Treatment) project. The project has been supported through the Treatment and Rehabilitation Subgroup of the Ballyfermot LDATF and coordinated through the <b>Treatment</b> and Rehabilitation <b>Coordinator.</b> The aim of this project was to highlight the importance of primary care for all women, to support screening and brief intervention within primary care, and to strengthen referral between primary care settings and community based drug and alcohol treatment services. This project incorporates a literature review, women in treatment data collection and a number of meetings with stakeholders including primary care nursing staff, HSE Addiction Services, D 10 drug and alcohol treatment services as well as women in the community. The project has raised the importance of looking at women as a distinct group in terms of drug and alcohol treatment services and the importance of a cross-sectoral approach as well as community engagement to progress the overall health of women in the community...|$|R
40|$|SETTING: Thirty-six {{priority}} {{cities in}} Sao Paulo State, Brazil, {{with a high}} incidence of tuberculosis (TB) cases, deaths and treatment default. OBJECTIVE: To identify the perspectives of city TB control coordinators regarding the most important components of adherence strategies adopted by health care teams to ensure patient adherence in 36 priority cities in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Qualitative research with semi-structured interviews conducted with the coordinators of the National TB Control Programme involved in the management of TB treatment services in the public sector. RESULTS: The main issues thought to influence adherence to directly observed <b>treatment</b> (DOT) by <b>coordinators</b> include incentives and benefits delivered to patients, patient-health care worker bonding and comprehensive care, the encouragement given by others to follow treatment (family, neighbours and health professionals), and help provided by health professionals for patients to recover their self-esteem. CONCLUSION: The main aspects mentioned by city TB control coordinators regarding patient adherence to treatment and to DOT in Sao Paulo are improvements in communications, relationships based on trust, a humane approach and including the patients in the decision-making process concerning their health...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{research}} plays {{a fundamental}} role in establishing new <b>treatments.</b> Clinical research <b>coordinators</b> are considered essential in clinical research, and medical professionals such as pharmacists often {{take on this}} role. Pharmacy students can be considered future candidates for this task. We used questionnaires to survey the knowledge of and attitudes toward registration trials and clinical research of pharmacy students at Tokushima University Hospital. All pharmacy students (103) to whom questionnaires were sent responded. Almost all respondents were aware of registration trials and clinical research. More than 90 % were aware of the existence of clinical research coordinators, and about half (48. 6 %) understood their role. In clinical research terminology, most respondents were aware of informed consent and related issues, but fewer than 20 % were aware of more practical things. In total, 29. 1 % and 40. 8 % of the respondents were willing to carry out and coordinate research. These findings suggest that pharmacy students have basic knowledge of clinical research and that many students are willing to carry out and coordinate clinical research. More practical exposure to clinical research may help to strengthen their future contribution. Further studies may help to determine how to provide education on registration trials and clinical research to pharmacy students...|$|R
40|$|Background: Glaucoma is {{the leading}} cause of {{irreversible}} blindness in the world. Estimated to affect 60 million people worldwide, this figure is expected to rise to 80 million by 2020. Untreated, glaucoma leads to visual decay and eventually to blindness, and can significantly reduce quality of life. First-line treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma is topical medical therapy with ocular hypotensives as eye drops. However, eye drops have several disadvantages including cost, possible local and systemic side effects, and adherence and perseverance issues. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that selective laser trabeculoplasty is equally as effective in lowering intraocular pressure as eye drops. However, the impact of these two treatment modalities from the patient and economic perspectives has not been adequately determined. Thus, it remains unclear whether topical medical therapy or selective laser trabeculoplasty should be recommended as first-line treatment for glaucoma. Methods/Design: This protocol describes an international, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial to determine the optimum first-line therapy for people with primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma. This study will compare the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and topical medication with respect to patients’ generic and glaucoma-specific quality of life. The trial will also provide a detailed cost-effectiveness analysis and compare the clinical effectiveness with respect to the degree of intraocular pressure lowering and rates of <b>treatment</b> failure. Research <b>coordinators</b> in each centre will identify and recruit previously untreated patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma. Those who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to enter a randomised controlled trial with either selective laser trabeculoplasty or topical ocular hypotensive therapy, according to a stepped regimen. Outcome assessment will be measured at 6 weeks and at 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment. Regular clinic follow-ups will continue as clinically indicated between study outcome visits. Discussion: The Glaucoma Initial Treatment Study is the first multi-centred RCT to determine the optimum first-line therapy for people with glaucoma. Our trial will have an unprecedented capacity to meaningfully transform the treatment and management of glaucoma in Australia and overseas. Ecosse L.
