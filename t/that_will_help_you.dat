500|$|Miller {{considered}} Uru a major {{departure from}} Myst and Riven in that Cyan {{wanted to create}} a persistent world, where actions occurred while the player was not online. Miller did not consider the game a true massively multiplayer online game, saying [...] "there is not leveling and skills and monsters and experience in any artificial sense. The 'leveling' is finding and exploring and owning new Ages that are released regularly; the experience is what you really learn while exploring <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> later—not points on a scale." [...] Miller considered there to be two benefits to such a system: firstly that players would care more about being part of the story, and secondly that even new players could make discoveries and be part of the community. The game was designed as more of a spin-off than a sequel to previous Myst games, due to the merging of items from the contemporary (traffic cones and T-shirts) to the fantastic (books that transport the user to new worlds).|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? <b>That</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E

6000|$|TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. BELOVED, I {{thought it}} convenient, since many at this day {{are exposed to}} sufferings, to give my advice {{touching}} that to thee. Namely, that thou wouldest take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, and not suffer thyself to be entangled in those snares that God hath suffered to be laid {{in the world for}} some. Beware of [...] "men" [...] in the counsel of Christ [...] "for they will deliver you up" [...] (Matt 10:17). Keep thou therefore within the bounds of uprightness and integrity towards both God and man: for <b>that</b> <b>will</b> fortify, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> preserve thee, if not from, yet under the rage of men, in a comfortable and quiet frame of heart. Wherefore do that, and <b>that</b> only, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> justify thy innocency, and <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>thee,</b> not with forced speech, but with good conscience, when oppressed, to make thy appeals to God, and to the consciences of all men.|$|R

50|$|But once a {{relationship}} is established, and {{the lines of communication}} are open, it is undeniably easier to have others on your side and others who are <b>willing</b> to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> out, both professionally and personally. Pfeffer (2010) acknowledges the dynamic relationship among trust, relationships, and power when he says, “Sometimes building {{a relationship}} so <b>that</b> others <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> requires nothing more than being polite and listening... Being nice to people is effective because people find it difficult to fight with those who are being polite and courteous.” When that key component of mutual understanding is absent in an organizational setting, however, silence comes into play, and a myriad of power schemes and competing agendas can influence the decision of whether or not to communicate concerns.|$|R
