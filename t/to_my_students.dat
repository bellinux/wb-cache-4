40|$|I am {{committed}} {{to share the}} excitement of learning with my students. I hope to convey <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>students</b> the importance of learning through shared meaning.

I certainly wish that my students learn something from me. Additionally, I hope that my overall enthusiasm to pursue topics of psychology models <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>students</b> that one can never stop learning. Moreover, I consistently learn how to better improve my teaching from my students. I believe that this dynamic relationship of teaching and learning accomplishes shared meaning in the classroom.
