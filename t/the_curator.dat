2500|$|The goal of <b>the</b> <b>curators</b> of <b>The</b> West as America was {{to reveal}} how artists {{during this period}} {{visually}} revised the conquest of the West {{in an effort to}} correspond with a national ideology that favored Western expansionism. [...] By mixing New West historiographical interpretation with Old West art, <b>the</b> <b>curators</b> sought not only to show how these frontier images have defined our idea of the national past but also to dispel the traditional beliefs behind the images. Many who visited the exhibit missed <b>the</b> <b>curator’s</b> point and instead became incensed with what they saw as <b>the</b> <b>curator’s</b> dismantling of <b>the</b> history and legacy of the American western frontier.|$|R

He then left the site to complete his medical studies and returned in 1904 with Harold St George Gray to continue the excavation until 1907. <b>The</b> <b>curator</b> of the Taunton museum of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, Gray had been trained in archaeological techniques by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the Black Stone has been much debated.

Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was actually an agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.|$|E

He was elected a member of the American Society of Naturalists and the American Society of Zoologists in 1914, and in 1919 served as second vice-president of the Entomological Society of America.

5|$|Grinsell {{was born}} in London on 14 February 1907. With his family, he moved to Brighton shortly after the First World War. There, his {{interest}} in archaeology was encouraged by H. S. Toms, <b>the</b> <b>curator</b> of Brighton Museum who had formerly been an assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. Moving back to London, in 1925 Grinsell became a clerk for Barclays Bank. Although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus his attention on barrows, recognising that these were among the least well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape {{and one of the}} few that could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of her work in Malta, Louis C. G. Clarke, <b>the</b> <b>curator</b> of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, invited her to lead {{excavations}} {{on the island of}} Menorca from 1930 to 1931. With the aid of Guest, she excavated the megalithic sites of Trapucó and Sa Torrera, resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca. Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as Egyptian Sculpture (1930) and Egyptian Temples (1931), which received largely positive reviews. In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in Whomerle Wood near to Stevenage, Hertfordshire; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography, with her motives for carrying out the excavation remaining unclear.|$|E
5|$|The cannon's fate is disputed. According to the memoirs (written in the 1890s) of Gonzales {{blacksmith}} Noah Smithwick, {{the cannon}} was abandoned after the cart's axles began to smoke during a march to San Antonio de Béxar {{to assist in}} Austin's siege. Smithwick reported that the cannon was buried near a creek not far from Gonzales. A small iron cannon was exposed during a June 1936 flood near Gonzales. In 1979, this cannon was purchased by Dr. Patrick Wagner, who believed it matched Smithwick's descriptions of the cannon used in the battle. <b>The</b> <b>Curator</b> of Military History at the Smithsonian Institution verified that Wagner's cannon was a type of small swivel gun used in America through 1836. The Conservation Laboratory at the University of Texas confirmed that Wagner's cannon had been buried in moist ground for an extended time period.|$|E

5|$|The early {{models for}} the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the {{exclusive}} Print Room at the British Museum {{in the company of}} Richard Aldington and <b>the</b> <b>curator</b> and poet Laurence Binyon in order to examine Nishiki-e prints that incorporated traditional Japanese verse. However, she also derived her way of making poems from her reading of Classical Greek literature and especially of Sappho, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound, each of whom produced versions of the Greek poet's work. In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by Euripides, publishing in 1916 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis, in 1919 a translation of choruses from Iphigeneia at Aulis and Hippolytus, an adaptation of Hippolytus called Hippolytus Temporizes (1927), a translation of choruses from The Bacchae and Hecuba (1931), and Euripides' Ion (1937) a loose translation of Ion.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may have purchased excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by <b>the</b> <b>curator</b> of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E
