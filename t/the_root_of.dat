5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the tooth and is thickest {{at the root}} apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is {{to serve as a}} medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E

50|$|In complex analysis, {{a branch}} of mathematics, the Gauss-Lucas theorem gives a {{geometrical}} relation between <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> a polynomial P and <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> its derivative P. <b>The</b> set <b>of</b> <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> a real or complex polynomial {{is a set of}} points in the complex plane.

When P has a single root then this convex hull is a single point and when <b>the</b> <b>roots</b> lie on a line then the convex hull is a segment of this line.

5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended.

5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over slow moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's characteristics in battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> his great battlefield successes.|$|E

5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940.

Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was <b>the</b> <b>root</b> <b>of</b> the charges in 1940.
