5|$|After Japan's {{surrender}} in 1945, China {{announced its}} intent to reclaim its {{rights to the}} Walled City. Refugees from mainland China because of the Chinese Civil War post 1945 poured in {{to take advantage of}} British protection (the Walled City is a Chinese territory but surrounded by British lands), and 2,000 squatters occupied the Walled City by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning the Walled City.|$|E

25|$|Smithfield Foods, {{the largest}} pork {{producer}} in the United States, said in January 2007 {{that it will}} phase out gestation crates from its 187 piggeries {{over the next ten}} years because of concerns from its customers.

He succeeded in converting a large number. The colonial government placed the converted Indians (known as Praying Indians) in a ring of villages around Boston as a defensive strategy. The oldest such village, Natick, was built in 1651.|$|E

His registers of baptisms, marriages and deaths, edited, with those of his successor, Thomas Dickenson, by J. Horsfall Turner, under the title of The Nonconformist Register, Brighouse, 1881, are of great biographical value.|$|E

To conceal his true intent, Gurney deceived inquisitive competitors by telling them the blunted trailing edge was intended to prevent injury and damage when pushing the car by hand. Some copied the design, and some of them even attempted to improve upon it by pointing the flap downwards, which actually hurt performance.|$|E
25|$|The Warriors {{went on to}} {{play the}} Utah Jazz {{in the second round}} of the 2006–07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Davis scored 32 points and {{electrified}} the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Game 5 in Salt Lake City.|$|E

However, that changed once Germans started retreating and leaving scorched earth behind. Germans and their Lithuanian auxiliaries confiscated and destroyed property, burned villages, forcefully evacuated residents towards Germany, etc.|$|E

In a Test Match in Melbourne, 1988–89, during Christmas, just before second last days play, Steve Waugh decided to bounce Patterson. At {{the end of the}} day's play, Patterson stormed into the Australian dressing room and threatened to kill all the opposition batsmen on the pitch on the fifth and final day of play. Australia were then dismissed for 114 chasing 400. Patterson finished with five wickets in the innings and nine wickets for the match.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{concluded}} quite {{early that}} Descartes's laws for the elastic collision of two bodies must be wrong, and he formulated the correct laws. An important step was his {{recognition of the}} Galilean invariance of the problems. His views then took many years to be circulated. He passed them on in person to William Brouncker and Christopher Wren in London, in 1661. What Spinoza wrote to Henry Oldenburg about them, in 1666 which was during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, was guarded. Huygens had actually worked <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a manuscript De motu corporum ex percussione in the period 1652–6. The war ended in 1667, and Huygens announced his results to the Royal Society in 1668. He published them in the Journal des sçavans in 1669.|$|E

25|$|During the Easter {{vacation}} in 1856, while Hofmann was visiting his native East End, Perkin performed some further {{experiments in the}} crude laboratory in his apartment {{on the top floor}} of his home in Cable Street in east London. It was here that he made his great accidental discovery: that aniline could be partly transformed into a crude mixture which—when extracted with alcohol—produced a substance with an intense purple colour. Perkin, who had an interest in painting and photography, immediately became enthusiastic about this result and carried out further trials with his friend Arthur Church and his brother Thomas. Since these experiments were not part of the work on quinine which had been assigned to Perkin, the trio carried <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a hut in Perkin's garden to keep them secret from Hofmann.|$|E
25|$|In late September, {{reinforcements}} from Baojing and Yongshun {{arrived and}} began small-scale skirmishes around the Shen Family Estate. Before commencing the final attack, Hu Zongxian persuaded his captive Chen Dong {{to write a}} letter to his followers encamped next to Xu Hai's forces, warning them that Xu Hai was conspiring with government troops to wipe <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a pincer operation. This provoked Chen Dong's men into attacking Xu Hai's group on September 27, upon which government forces entered the fray from all directions, killing indiscriminately. On September 29, the battle ended with up to 1600 marauders killed in the estate, and Xu Hai's body was found in a nearby stream. On October 10, Chen Dong, Ye Ma, and Xu Hai's hostage brother were all executed in Jiaxing, marking the end of the wokou invasion of 1556.|$|E

He once again appeared in the first three rounds of the renamed 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, scoring 71 opening against Buckinghamshire in the second round, and 57 from the same position in the third round defeat to Warwickshire. His first-class debut for Kent came later in the same season, against Leicestershire in July 2001, claiming the wicket of Aftab Habib as his first scalp in a match that Kent won by three wickets at Grace Road.|$|E
