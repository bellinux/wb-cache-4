500|$|Ray Subers, {{writing for}} Box Office Mojo, {{compared}} {{the film to}} Disney's 2010 animated feature Tangled {{by saying that the}} film's story was not as [...] "immediately interesting" [...] and that [...] "marketing has yet to sell this to boys the way Tangled did". Noting that the 2013 holiday season (<b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>and</b> <b>Christmas)</b> lacked compelling content for families, Subers predicted that the film would [...] "play well all the way through Christmas" [...] and end up grossing $185 million in North America (similar to Wreck-It Ralph). Boxoffice noted the success of previous Disney's animated films released during the holiday season (Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph), but argued that the cast might not attract audiences {{due to the lack of}} major stars. They issued a $170,000,000 North America box office forecast for the film. Chris Agar from ScreenRant expressed a similar opinion; he cited a string of recent box office successes of the studio, and thought that Frozen would fill a void of kid-friendly films in the marketplace, but did not expect it to surpass Catching Fire in terms of box office gross.|$|E

2500|$|Stereotypical Georgian traits include manners {{known as}} [...] "Southern hospitality", {{a strong sense}} of {{community}} and shared culture, and a distinctive Southern dialect.

The team that constructed it consisted of Yash Terakura, Shiraz Shivji, Bob Russell, Bob Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes, and some sample software were finished {{in time for the}} show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both <b>Thanksgiving</b> <b>and</b> <b>Christmas</b> weekends. The machine used the same case, same-sized motherboard, and same Commodore BASIC 2.0 in ROM as the VIC-20. BASIC also served as the user interface shell and was available immediately on startup at the READY prompt. When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64. The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: [...] "All we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'" [...] The answer was vertical integration; due to Commodore's ownership of MOS Technology's semiconductor fabrication facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of [...]|$|E
