5|$|<b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> {{performed}} twice: {{during both}} 1999 Michael Jackson & Friends concerts. It {{is similar to}} the 1995 mix, but has clicking sound effects instead of the main drumbeat during the spoken part, and a short interlude with the dancers introducing themselves.|$|E
5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened idler crank arm, an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> hidden in a hole beside the runway, the same shape as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining {{the morale of the}} defending troops.|$|E

5|$|Four {{significant}} changes to Highway3 {{have taken place}} since the designation of the route in 1920. The first was an adjustment to the eastern terminus. The second was the Essex Bypass, built through the 1970s between Windsor and Leamington. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> the St. Thomas Expressway, a super two highway built in the late 1970s. The final change was the provincial highway transfers conducted in 1997 and 1998 that resulted in three segments of Highway3 being decommissioned: between Leamington and Talbotville Royale, through Port Colborne and within Fort Erie.|$|E
5|$|Frankel praised Livolsi {{for making}} the film's four key montages—the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction—work. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> {{particularly}} challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the reception at the museum, where Livolsi wove B-roll footage in to keep the action flowing.|$|E

5|$|Game {{development}} {{began by}} late 2008. There was high staff turnover {{from the previous}} Saints Row team with one-fifth of the final 100-person staff having worked on a previous title in the series. They aimed to improve on the series by giving the game a coherent tone, and found it in films such as Hot Fuzz and the game's signature sex toy bat. Saints Row: <b>The</b> <b>Third</b> <b>was</b> built using the Havok physics engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} Munich years Busch's {{attempts}} to write libretti, which are almost forgotten today, were unsuccessful. Up to 1863 {{he worked on}} two or three major works; <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> composed by Georg Kremplsetzer. Busch's Liebestreu und Grausamkeit, a romantic opera in three acts, Hansel und Gretel and Der Vetter auf Besuch, an opera buffa of sorts, were not particularly successful. There was a dispute between Busch and Kremplsetzer during the staging of Der Vetter auf Besuch, leading to the removal of Busch's name from the production; the piece was renamed Singspiel von Georg Kremplsetzer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} round, Johnson faced the one {{remaining}} Team Koscheck member, Nam Phan. In a back-and-forth fight, Johnson scored takedowns. The consensus after {{the fight was}} that Johnson won the opening round, and Phan the second. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> in dispute however, with each fighter's coach convinced they had won the round. Johnson was declared the winner via split decision.|$|E

50|$|In {{standard}} jazz harmony, tritone substitution {{works because}} the two chords share two pitches: namely, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> and seventh, albeit reversed. In a G7 chord, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>is</b> B and <b>the</b> seventh is F; whereas, in its tritone substitution, D7, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>is</b> F and <b>the</b> seventh is C (enharmonically B). Notice that the interval between <b>the</b> <b>third</b> and seventh of a dominant seventh chord is itself a tritone.|$|R
5|$|In the post-Vijayanagara era, the Kaivalya {{tradition}} branched three ways. The first {{consisted of}} {{followers of the}} Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> the branch that kept the vachana tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it {{still needs to be}} studied.|$|E
5|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Morris made 43 in a total of 361 before Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Morris was rested for the following three matches against the Gentlemen of England, Somerset and the South of England. The first two matches were won by innings while <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> washed out after Australia took a large first-innings lead. In the meantime, Morris underwent minor surgery for a split in his hand.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1993 {{creation}} of the National Native Title Tribunal, there have been four separate claims to Native Title lodged over alienated lands in the ACT by representatives of the Ngunnawal communities, in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002. The first two of these were discontinued after reaching a Federal Court hearing, and <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> rejected as not meeting applicable provisions.

5|$|The Chicago {{exhibition}} was sufficiently successful to prompt businessman Charles L. Willoughby to commission a second version, {{which opened in}} Boston, Massachusetts, on December 22, 1884. From its opening until 1892, approximately 200,000 people viewed the painting. The Boston version was housed in a specially designed building, the Cyclorama Building, on Tremont Street, and {{was the site of}} popular public lectures on the battle. Two additional copies of the cyclorama were made: <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> first exhibited in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, beginning in February 1886 and a fourth debuted in Brooklyn, New York, in October 1886.|$|E
5|$|The MSC Railway {{was able}} to receive and {{despatch}} goods trains to and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks. Two were {{to the north of}} the canal, operated by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), where by the MSC Railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.|$|E

The former two were traffic circles in place since the QEW was opened in 1940. <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>was</b> a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of Highway27 to ten lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with the Rainbow Bridge Approach and with Highway27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway–freeway traffic movements.|$|E
