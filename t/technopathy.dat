5000|$|The Ultimate Marvel {{iteration}} of {{the character}} is Reverend William Stryker, Jr., the son of William Stryker, Sr. {{and the leader of}} an anti-mutant coalition armed with Sentinel technology that is possibly stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. He has a Sentinel tech body armor that resembles Ahab from the mainstream Marvel universe and various alternate realities.

5000|$|After {{the success}} of the three X-Men films, the studio {{produced}} a spin-off film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This film explains and expands on the origins of Logan/Wolverine, including his time at the Weapon X facility. It explains that Weapon X is the tenth weapon created by the lab. Each weapon is a living mutant enhanced by technological means. Weapon X (Wolverine) is given adamantium bones to increase his durability. Weapon XI was portrayed in the film as a genetically altered Wade Wilson played by both Scott Adkins and Ryan Reynolds. Weapon XI is also referred to by Col. William Stryker as [...] "Deadpool", due to having powers [...] "pooled" [...] from many other mutants killed and/or kidnapped in the film, including Wolverine's healing factor, Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation ability, and Chris Bradley's <b>technopathy.</b> He also has retractable blades extending from his arms. Weapon XI is the final antagonist of the film, having been genetically altered to be the ultimate mutant killer. His head is cut off by Wolverine while his back is turned battling Sabretooth. In a post-credits scene of some prints, his body looks for and finds his head in the rubble, which returns to life (and gains a mouth, which he previously lacked).|$|E
5000|$|Wade Wilson / Deadpool {{makes his}} first feature film {{appearance}} in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. He {{is a highly}} skilled, wisecracking, and amoral mercenary who wields a pair of katanas with superhuman athleticism and skill sufficient to deflect fully automatic weapons fire. He is supposedly killed by Victor Creed, but is later revealed to have been transformed by Colonel William Stryker into mutant killer [...] "Weapon XI" [...] (stunts performed by Scott Adkins) that possesses other mutants' powers, including Scott Summers's optic blasts, John Wraith's teleportation, Wolverine's healing factor, {{and a pair of}} extendable blades resembling the character's prized swords; Stryker is able to completely control him thanks to Chris Bradley's <b>technopathy.</b> He is referred to by Stryker as [...] "the Deadpool" [...] because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one being. Wolverine and Victor fight Deadpool in the film's climax and manage to defeat him by decapitating him and sending him falling into a cooling tower of a nuclear power plant, although a post-credits scene appearing in DVD releases and some theatrical presentations of the film implies Deadpool is still alive, as his hand is shown reaching out for his still-living head amid the rubble of the destroyed tower.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that {{this version of}} Brainiac (like the previous ones) was merely a nanite-controlled probe of the real Brainiac, who was a living Coluan that had genetically and cybernetically enhanced himself. The true Brainiac lacked psychic powers, but still possessed superhuman physical attributes, intelligence, and <b>technopathy.</b> Like the Pre-Crisis Brainiac, he is mentally connected to his ship {{in such a way}} that he can be disabled for a short period if separated without warning. Initially, Brainiac had the weakness of being disabled by his mysophobia and sensory overload when dumped into Earth's atmosphere, though he doesn't seem to have this defect in his later battles on Earth such as when he defeated Superboy, suggesting that he fixed it, though he commented that he still didn't like being on the [...] "dirty" [...] planet. The true Brainiac is enormously physically powerful and even stronger than Superman, capable of overpowering the Kryptonian in a grapple and flooring him with a single punch, while referring to Superman's own blows as [...] "nothing" [...] by comparison, as well as catching one of Superman's punches and crushing his hand until it bled, forcing Superman to his knees. He heals from injuries at incredible speed. However being separated from his ship for prolonged periods causes him to physically deteriorate and become far less powerful, as Lex Luthor observed while studying his unconscious body over the course of several days. At one point Brainiac 5 warns that Superman would most likely die against Brainiac in a straight fight.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of season eight, it is {{revealed}} that Chloe was not arrested by DDS, but Lex's security personnel impersonating DDS agents.

5000|$|Oscar Isaac portrays En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse as the titular main {{antagonist}} in X-Men: Apocalypse. Isaac {{revealed that}} both practical and digital effects {{would be used}} for Apocalypse's costume. The actor had to go through extensive makeup and prosthetics applications, in addition to wearing high-heeled boots and a 40-pound suit to appear taller and more imposing. In the film, Apocalypse demonstrates various abilities, such as telepathy, telekinesis, <b>technopathy,</b> teleportation, flight, cellular regeneration, matter and energy manipulation, mutant enhancement, protective shielding, enhanced adaptive skills, and superhuman physical attributes. The world's first and most powerful mutant, the immortal Apocalypse emerged in prehistoric times and was worshipped as various gods. He developed some form of technology and merged with a Celestial battle-suit that allowed him to transfer his essence into the bodies of others, who were usually other mutants so that he could amass their powers; historical records make reference to his 'Four Horsemen', and how destruction always followed in his wake. When he was being transferred into the body of a mutant with a healing factor, some of his followers betrayed him and trapped him underneath his pyramid, and Apocalypse remained in stasis for millennia until he was accidentally awakened in the 1980s. Apocalypse subsequently recruits Storm, Psylocke, Angel and Magneto as his Four Horsemen, claiming that he intends to build a world where only the 'strong' survive. When the telepathic professor Charles Xavier psychically contacts Magneto, Apocalypse detects his presence, and is somehow able to turn the connection back on Xavier and use him to make the world's governments launch all of Earth's nuclear missiles into space, preventing the humans from rebelling against him. After kidnapping Xavier, Apocalypse attempts to transfer his consciousness into the professor's body to further advance his telepathy and take control of every mind on the planet, but he is opposed by the new X-Men - Raven Darkhölme, Hank McCoy, Scott Summers, Jean Grey, Kurt Wagner, and Magneto's son Peter. During the final battle, Nightcrawler teleports Xavier away from Apocalypse's transferral equipment, while the other X-Men face the Four Horsemen. When Angel is later defeated, Ororo turns against Apocalypse when she sees his disregard for his 'loyal follower', and Magneto is later convinced to betray Apocalypse as well, resulting in the villain being attacked by all the X-Men while Xavier engages him in a telepathic battle on the astral plane. He is finally defeated when Xavier encourages Jean to tap into her full potential, the resulting blast disintegrating Apocalypse. Before he dies, he cryptically describes Jean's unleashing of her power as [...] "all being revealed".|$|E
40|$|Piglets {{infected}} with the conventional swine plague virus {{as a result of}} secondary bacterial infections sometimes show an insufficiently clear clinical and pathoanatomical picture, which is why the very procedure of diagnosis is complex and the final diagnosis unreliable. That is why these investigations were aimed at examining the presence of bacterial microflora in diseased and dead pilgets which were found to have the viral antigen for CSP using the fluorescent antibody technique, in cases where the pathomorphological finding was not characteristic for conventional swine plague. Autopsies of dead piglets most often showed changes in the digestive tract and lungs, with resulting <b>technopathy</b> and diseases of infective nature. Such findings on knowledge of a present bacterial microflora are especially important in cases when conventional swine plague is controlled on farms and an announcement that the disease has been contained is in the offing...|$|E
