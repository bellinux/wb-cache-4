5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>stresses</b> and its {{distribution}} in complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical}} role in the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> distribution, its concentration and also <b>to</b> quantify <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> and strain at any point in the chain plate.

5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, {{while under the}} care of a Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic ulcer. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> induced by the family's lack of money. Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E

5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{observations}} of stress states on other faults after large earthquakes {{fall into two}} viewpoints: one is that stress states are little affected by the main shock, which suggests that <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> drop of <b>the</b> main shock, relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tectonic <b>stress</b> level, is small (e.g. Kubo and Fukuyama, 2004). The other is the opposite case, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> drop of <b>the</b> main shock is comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tectonic <b>stress</b> level (e.g. Hardebeck and Hauksson, 2001; Yamashita et al., 2004). If {{the conclusion of a}} relatively small <b>stress</b> drop is <b>the</b> case, then a stress measurement might not be directly useful for earthquake forecasts, because the measurement {{would not be able to}} resolve stress variations during an earthquake cycle. On the other hand, in <b>the</b> opposite case, <b>stress</b> measurements would be quite valuable for earthquake forecasts, because <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> accumulation process on the fault is likely to be observed by stress measurements. Considering these two conflicting observations, it is necessary to examine two aspects of <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> state of <b>the</b> Anninghe-Zemuhe fault zone: the first is whether <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> drop on <b>the</b> Zemuhe fault, relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tectonic <b>stress</b> at <b>the</b> latest earthquake in 1850, is detectable or not. <b>The</b> second is <b>to</b> determine what <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> state on <b>the</b> Anninghe fault is, relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tectonic <b>stress.</b>|$|R
