5|$|The {{expansion}} of Mayfair moved upper class Londoners away from {{areas such as}} Covent Garden and Soho, which were already in decline by the 18th century. Part of its success was because of its proximity to the Court of St James and the parks, {{and because of the}} well-designed layout. This led to it sustaining its popularity into the 21st century. The requirements of the aristocracy led to various stables, coach houses and servants' accommodation being established along the mews running parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Some of the stables have since been converted into garages and offices.|$|E
