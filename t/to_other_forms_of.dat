5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse {{together to form a}} single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product.

5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day after}} the killings, the head of the State Treasury, Pekka Syrjänen, said that {{students}} would be able to seek compensation from the state for physical and psychological damage caused by the shootings. This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted in relation <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings {{as a consequence of the}} attack. Relatives were also able to gain compensation for costs incurred whilst caring for those affected, or funeral or hospital bills.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm that swept through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries. This wave was {{responsible}} for the foundation of the majority of England's monasteries, and very few were founded after the 13th century. These monasteries were often founded by a wealthy aristocratic benefactor who endowed and patronised the establishments in return for prayers for their soul, and often, the right to be buried within the monastic church. Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed the monastic rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E

5|$|Since initial release, Labyrinth {{has been}} {{translated}} <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> media. The film was novelized by A. C. H. Smith as Labyrinth: A Novel Based On The Jim Henson Film, {{which is currently}} out of print. Along with The Dark Crystal, Archaia Publishing reprinted Labyrinth with illustrations in 2014. A three-issue comic book adaptation, which was first released in a single volume as Marvel Super Special #40, was published by Marvel Comics. Tokyopop, in partnership with The Jim Henson Company, published a manga-style four-volume comic called Return to Labyrinth, written by Jake T. Forbes and illustrated by Chris Lie, with cover art by Kouyu Shurei. Return to Labyrinth follows the adventures of Toby as a teenager, when he is tricked into returning to the Labyrinth by Jareth. The first volume was released August 8, 2006, with a second following on October 9, 2007 and a third on May 1, 2009. In an afterword to the second volume, editor Tim Beedle announced that the series, originally planned as a trilogy, was being extended to include a fourth volume. The fourth and final volume of Return to Labyrinth was released on August 3, 2010.|$|E
