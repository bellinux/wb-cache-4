40|$|When {{looking back}} {{into the history of}} {{botulism}} and contemplating the final understanding of the syndrome and the ultimate solutions, there are four facets that stand out clearly. The first is that much of the solution was guided by astute observations, curious travellers, committed veterinarians and particularly farmers themselves who were able to relate the occurrence of the condition to climatic and grazing conditions. Secondly, there was the identification of the osteophagia and pica syndrome which led to the feeding <b>of</b> <b>bone-meal</b> as a successful mitigating measure as well as the establishment that botulism was not due to a plant poisoning. Thirdly, the solution of the problem depended on the integration of experience and knowledge from diverse disciplines such as soil science, animal behaviour and husbandry, nutrition, botany and ultimately advanced bacteriology and the science of immunology. Finally it required the technical advancement to produce toxoids in large quantities and formulate effective aluminium hydroxide precipitated and oil emulsion vaccines. </span...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{receptor}} mechanisms mediating the retrograde axonal <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> the neurotrophins {{have been}} investigated in adult rats. We show that <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> the TrkB ligands NT- 4 and BDNF to peripheral neurons {{is dependent on the}} low affinity neurotrophin receptor (LNR). Pharmacological manipulation of LNR in vivo using either an anti-LNR antibody or a soluble recombinant LNR extracellular domain completely blocked retrograde <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> NT- 4 and BDNF to sensory neurons, while having minimal effects on the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> NGF in either sensory or sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, in mice with a null mutation <b>of</b> LNR, the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> NT- 4 and BDNF, but not NGF, was dramatically reduced. These observations demonstrate a selective role for LNR in retrograde <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> the various neurotrophins from distinct target regions in vivo...|$|R

In this study the effect of phenobarbitone on nucleocytoplasmic <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> ribosomes was measured in an assay system in vitro. The <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> radioactive ribosomes from isolated rat hepatic nuclei to unlabelled post-microsomal supernatant was measured in rats treated with 80 mg of phenobarbitone/kg body wt. or saline 3 h before death.

However, phenobarbitone treatment increased <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> ribonucleoproteins over saline-treated animals nearly twofold. The effect of phenobarbitone was mediated through the cytosol, but was not the result of altered stability <b>of</b> the RNA <b>transported</b> to the cytosol.

Axonal <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> mitochondria is not related to neurofilaments and endoplasmic reticulum. Changes in the cross-sectional area of axons, even upon reduction to half the normal size, do not noticeably affect mitochondrial transport.

40|$|The <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> {{glutamine}} and alanine into isolated rat colonocytes was studied.
