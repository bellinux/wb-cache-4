5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E

5|$|A cold-core low, {{also known}} as an upper level low or cold-core cyclone, is a cyclone aloft which has an {{associated}} cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth's troposphere. It is a low pressure system that strengthens with height {{in accordance with the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relationship. If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans, it is called a subtropical cyclone. Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, can occur near the center of cold-core lows. Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts, such as polar lows, and Von Karman Vortices. Cold lows can lead directly to the development of tropical cyclones, owing to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> {{relation}} {{does not}} explain why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} a misnomer, since it really describes {{the change in}} wind with height, rather the wind itself. However, one can view the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> as a geostrophic wind that varies with height, so that the term wind seems appropriate. In {{the early years of}} meteorology, when data was scarce, the wind field could be estimated using the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relation and knowledge of a surface wind speed and direction as well as thermodynamic soundings aloft. In this way, the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relation acts to define the wind itself, rather than just its shear. Many authors retain the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> moniker, even though it describes a wind gradient, sometimes offering a clarification to that effect.|$|E

25|$|Mathematically, the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> {{relation}} {{defines a}} vertical wind shear--a variation in wind speed or direction with height. The wind shear {{in this case}} is a function of a horizontal temperature gradient, which is a variation in temperature over some horizontal distance. Also called baroclinic flow, the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> varies with height in proportion to the horizontal temperature gradient. The <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> relation results from hydrostatic balance and geostrophic balance {{in the presence of a}} temperature gradient along constant pressure surfaces, or isobars.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Thermal</b> <b>wind</b> is {{wind that}} varies with height {{due to a}} balance between the Coriolis and pressure-gradient forces in the atmosphere.

The exact partition function has been computed with the helps of our previous works:[arXiv: 1012. 5721 [hep-th]], [arXiv: 1109. 3365 [hep-th]], and naturally decomposed into two parts. The first part is contributed from strings freely propagating in the asymptotic region, which {{are identified as}} the superstring gas at the Hawking temperature on the linear-dilaton background. The second part includes the contribution localized around the `tip of cigar', which characterizes the non-extremality.

30|$|The {{generally}} oscillatory {{nature of}} high hemisphericities remains {{a problem at}} all parameter combinations and geometries explored in DW 13 and in the present study. Latitudinal temperature variations paired with their respective gradients in convective efficiency never fail to drive strong <b>thermal</b> <b>winds.</b> These in turn lead to a significant Ω-effect that seems to favour oscillatory dynamos (Dietrich et al. 2013). None of the variations in the general set-up explored in this paper have indicated that this fundamental mechanism is incorrect.|$|R
25|$|In a {{baroclinic}} atmosphere, where {{density is}} a function of both pressure and temperature, such horizontal temperature gradients can exist. The difference in horizontal wind speed with height that results is a vertical wind shear, traditionally called the <b>thermal</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{horizontal}} {{temperature gradient}} exists while moving North-South along a meridian because {{curvature of the}} Earth allows for more solar heating at the equator than at the poles. This creates a westerly geostrophic wind pattern to form in the mid-latitudes. Because <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> causes an increase in wind velocity with height, the westerly pattern increases in intensity up until the tropopause, creating a strong wind current known as the jet stream. The Northern and Southern Hemispheres exhibit similar jet stream patterns in the mid-latitudes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> is {{the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.|$|E

500|$|As {{air flows}} {{radially}} inward at low levels, {{it begins to}} rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause, its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone. [...] The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from <b>thermal</b> <b>wind</b> balance, this corresponds to {{a system that is}} warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. “warm-core”).
