The hydrothermal deposits have common characteristics as follows: location exclusively in Palaeozoic strata, epigenetic character; simple, monotonous paragencsis (barite ± siderite as main nonmetallic minerals and Hg-tetrahedrite as preponderant ore mineral); siderite characterized by high CaO, MgO and low MnO content; all <b>tetrahedrites</b> are Hg, Ag, Au, Hi-bearing; barite with average content of 2. 9 wt% of SrS 04.

40|$|International audienceNaturally {{occurring}} sulfosalt minerals of the tetrahedrite–tennantite series ((Cu,Fe,Zn,Ag,Hg) 12 (Sb,As) 4 S 13) are studied {{because of}} their potential use as basic components {{in the manufacture of}} thermoelectric devices for moderate-temperature applications. In the work reported herein, the chemical, crystallographic, thermoelectric, and magnetic properties of four specimens from different ores from Europe and America were exhaustively characterized. Our study revealed that these natural <b>tetrahedrites</b> usually behave as low-to-moderately doped p-type semiconductors with low mobility. Their carrier charge transport is thus located at the edge between hopping and itinerant mechanisms. The magnetic study, probing the behavior of the constituent iron species, revealed that an insignificant part of the iron occurs as ferromagnetic impurities. The dominant iron species is Fe 2 + ions with antiferromagnetic interactions.

Textural studies and element-partitioning data between coexisting mineral pairs point to a close approach to chemical equilibrium in both the assemblages.

40|$|In Paleozoic {{rocks of}} Southeastern Bosnia (SEB) there are numerous, but very small vein and {{replacement}} barite ore deposits containing up to 10 % Pb-Zn-Fe-Cu sulphides. Their geochemical characteristics are compared with large barite monosulphide (Hg-tetrahedrite) ore deposits in Mid-Bosnian Schist Mountains (MBSM). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios in the barites of both area {{are very similar}} (0. 710972 and 0. 714170 in SEB, 0. 711764 and 0. 712548 in MBSM) and indicate epigenetic hydrothermal origin of barite ore deposits. To the same conclusion point elevated Sr content in barites of both area (0. 48 to 2. 83 % in SEB, 1. 44 % in MBSM) and the δ 13 C and δ 18 O values in neominerals of barite ore deposits which are shifted toward lower values relative to typical values occurring in Devonian host rock. The δ 18 O values in barites from SEB (+ 14. 2 ‰ to + 15. 6 ‰) are remarkably lower than those from MBSM (+ 15. 8 ‰ to + 22. 4 ‰) what {{can be explained by}} lower temperature and lower salinity of mineralisation fluids in barite ore deposits of SEB. The δ 34 S values in barites of SEB are positive (+ 11. 6 ‰ to 17. 7 ‰) and enriched in heavy sulphur isotope in comparison with sulphides of SEB (- 0. 41 to + 4. 26 ‰), whereas those in <b>tetrahedrites</b> are negative (- 4. 95 in SEB, - 5. 50 to - 15. 40 ‰ in MBSM) indicating two remarkably different sulphur sources and time of formation. Barite ore deposits of both area, SEB and MBSM, have been genetically linked to fluids originated in the processes of Late Variscan S-type of magmatism and metamorphism of Upper Proterozoic and Lower Paleozoic rock complexes. However later, heating processes in Post Variscan/Eoalpine time affected significant parts of barite ore deposits in MBSM.
