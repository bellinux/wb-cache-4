25|$|In most {{societies}} {{the great}} majority of people eat meat when <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> but increasing controversy and debate has arisen over the ethics of eating animals. The most commonly given ethical objection to meat-eating is that, for most people living in the developed world, it is not necessary for survival or health; slaughtering animals solely because people enjoy the taste of meat is argued by some to be wrong and morally unjustifiable.|$|E
2500|$|In early Brazil, {{there is}} {{extensive}} reportage of cannibalism among the Tupinamba. It is recorded about the natives of the captaincy of Sergipe in Brazil: [...] "They eat human flesh when <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> {{and if a}} woman miscarries devour the abortive immediately. If she goes her time out, she herself cuts the navel-string with a shell, which she boils along with the secondine, and eats them both." [...] In modern Brazil, a black comedy film, How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, mostly in the Tupi language, portrays a Frenchman captured by the indigenous and his demise.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson came {{to teach}} at Howard University after {{delivering}} a lecture there in February 1979. Impressed with his knowledge and force of personality, students formed a committee to investigate his background, then met with faculty to discuss their findings. The joint student-faculty group then petitioned Howard University President James E. Cheek to hire Robinson as the next dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. Robinson joined Howard in September 1979. During his tenure as dean, he expanded the curriculum, organized the African American Architect Initiative, and established a program to encourage D.C. schoolchildren to choose a career in urban design and planning. Robinson has long advocated equal access for African-American architects, but argues that black architects should seek work where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "I don't want to ask for anything. It's embarrassing to me," [...] he told Newsday in 1991. [...] "I have {{a new sense of}} being a radical. I really had to, with the barrage of negative press and complaints of what we don't have. I'm tired of it. ... We simply aren't going to get large corporate work. That's a different network. But we have our own network. We have the black church, we have the black sororities and fraternities. Of course we want equal access, but no profession is without its barriers." ...|$|E

40|$|Most of {{us think}} it proper to study {{regulation}} but {{it is harder to}} say how regulation can be carried out properly. Regulators, indeed, seem to be on a hiding to nothing - they are routinely savaged in the press, they are seldom informed that they have got it right and hardly ever told what a balanced or successful regime of regulation would like.

50|$|A slumlord (or slum landlord) is a {{derogatory}} {{term for}} a landlord, generally an absentee landlord {{with more than one}} property, who attempts to maximize profit by minimizing spending on property maintenance, often in deteriorating neighborhoods.

50|$|When {{plausibility}} {{reduces the}} impact of self-enhancement, undesirable evidence often has to be accepted, albeit reluctantly.

60|$|Nevertheless, {{as it is}} {{possible}} that, for a time, man may, through sin, or circumstances, or both, be reduced to such a condition as to take shelter in a pig-stye, without exposing himself {{to the charge of}} being a pig; so, it {{is possible}} that a man may frequent a low tavern, not without detriment, but, without becoming thereby worthy of being classed with the lowest of the low. Do not misunderstand us, gentle reader. We do not wish in the slightest degree to palliate the coarse language, the debasement, the harsh villainy, which shock the virtuous when visiting the haunts of poverty.

60|$|What {{the camel}} is among animals {{that is the}} cactus among plants--the most {{confirmed}} and specialised of desert-haunting organisms.

But cactuses, like camels, take in their water supply whenever <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> and never waste any of it on the way by needless evaporation. As they form the perfect central type of desert vegetation, and are also familiar plants to everyone, they may be taken as a good illustrative example of the effect that desert conditions inevitably produce upon vegetable evolution.|$|E
