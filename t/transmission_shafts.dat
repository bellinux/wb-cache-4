2500|$|The Kingsnorth {{design team}} hastily set about {{redesigning}} the power car and transmission gear, {{and at the}} same time, staff at East Fortune were also looking into ways of improving the design. Kingsnorth considered the idea of replacing the Roll-Royce engines with [...] Fiat units having a direct drive to the propellers; while East Fortune's Engineering Officer, Lt.Cdr. A. S. Abell, RNVR, together with Flt.Cdr. J. S. Wheelwright, DSC (Captain of N.S.3), {{came up with the idea}} of raising the control car to the same level as the engineers' car; form them into a single fully enclosed unit that measured [...] in length and tapered to the stern, and fit the propellers directly onto the engine crankshafts. These and other minor measures provided the crew with more room and improved their comfort; increased top speed through reduced air resistance (the redesigned car was more aerodynamic and positioned closer to the envelope); resulted in a reduction in weight; and improved reliability due to the abolition of the troublesome <b>transmission</b> <b>shafts.</b> In January 1918, the Admiralty granted permission for these modifications to be undertaken at both Kingsnorth, and at East Fortune where the work was completed by the beginning of March.|$|E

40|$|A {{flexible}} shaft {{is prone to}} a number of vibration phenomena which occur at frequencies other than synchronous with rotational speed.

50|$|Self-aligning ball bearings, {{such as the}} Wingquist bearing {{shown in}} the picture, are {{constructed}} with the inner ring and ball assembly contained within an outer ring that has a spherical raceway.

The bearing was used mainly in bearing arrangements with very long shafts, such as <b>transmission</b> <b>shafts</b> in textile factories.One drawback of the self-aligning ball bearings is a limited load rating, as the outer raceway has very low osculation (radius is much larger than ball radius).

Also the spherical roller thrust bearing is an invention that derives from the findings by Wingquist.|$|E

Colin Chapman introduced modest front wings and a spoiler on Graham Hill's Lotus 49B at Monaco. Brabham and Ferrari went one better at the Belgian Grand Prix with full width wings mounted on struts high above the driver.
