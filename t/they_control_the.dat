5|$|When Romero's {{committee}} intensifies its investigation, Underwood {{tries to}} divert their attention by ordering troops into Syria on {{the pretense of}} preventing a terrorist attack. This provokes Durant to testify against him; before she can take the stand, however, Underwood pushes her {{down a flight of}} stairs, incapacitating her. When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E

25|$|Trawler/purse seiners are {{designed}} so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged {{and used for}} both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> pursing lines and warp leads and {{in such a way}} as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.|$|E

25|$|This {{leads to}} {{decision}} making by the parents. Rightful parental ownership over the embryo {{is only in}} the short-run and means that <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> embryos biological future. Consent over tissue ownership has been an issue for decades and can have legal repercussions. In the case of Henrietta Lacks, researchers lacked patient consent to use her tissues in genetic research, and this led to many legal issues on the family’s right to profit from the use of her cells. Decisiveness over autonomy is necessary in the case of IVF to avoid long run issues and give people their full rights of humanity.|$|E
25|$|In Campaign mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} missions, the goal of most {{of which is to}} defeat the computer controlled opponent or opponents by gaining possession of their territory. In the original release of the game, there were three separate campaigns of eight missions each; one campaign each for the Romans, Egyptians and Asians. The Mission CD expansion added three additional campaigns of eight missions for each race, and Quest of the Amazons added two campaigns of twelve missions each; one in which the player controls the Amazons against the others, and one in which <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> others against the Amazons.|$|E

25|$|Paul has {{promoted}} lawsuits against Marvel Entertainment claiming that Stan Lee Media owns {{the rights to}} all the Marvel characters created by Stan Lee. These would include Spider-Man and The X-Men. Paul and his associates further claim that Stan Lee Media was never properly dissolved as a corporation, and that <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> company. Though courts have found that some Stan Lee Media characters were improperly transferred to Stan Lee's later company, Pow Entertainment, plaintiffs have not yet found traction with these broader claims, and Stan Lee himself has both publicly dismissed these claims and has engaged {{in a series of}} cross-suits with Stan Lee Media, Peter Paul, and his associates.|$|E
25|$|Each Senate {{committee}} and subcommittee {{is led by}} a chair (usually {{a member of the}} majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even senility. Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president; they manage {{on the floor of the}} full Senate the consideration of those bills the committee reports. This last role was particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence: senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it, than they were before reform. The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking member. In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as the vice chair.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Teodoro Agoncillo, a Filipino {{historian}} from the University of the Philippines, mentions that the collaboration enabled the Spanish to readily subjugate the Indios (natives of the Philippines) by a potent combination of {{secular and religious}} might. The successful Legazpi conquest of the Philippines in 1565 recognized the power of clergy by bringing along Augustinian friar, navigator and priest Andrés de Urdaneta, to help control the natives. Other Spanish rulers acknowledged the importance of clergy. A Mexican viceroy (quoted in Agoncillo) said that in each friar in the Philippines, they had a captain and a whole army. However, Church involvement had numerous ill effects, as antifriar Marcelo H. del Pilar of the late 19th century complains: ...the friars control all the fundamental forces of society in the Philippines. <b>They</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> educational system, for they own the University of Santo Tomás, and are the local inspectors of every primary school. <b>They</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> {{minds of the people}} because in a dominantly Catholic country, the parish rectors can utilize the pulpit and confessionals to publicly or secretly influence the people.|$|E

[...] In a retrospective article about the critical reception of Sucker Punch, James MacDowell questioned the alleged misogyny of the film, arguing {{that it does not}} in fact aim to offer female empowerment, but is instead [...] "a deeply pessimistic analysis of female oppression", because it makes clear that, [...] "just as men organize the dances, so do <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> terms of the fight scenes; in neither do the women have true agency, only an illusion of it." ...|$|E

However, on May 9, 2013, the resolution of ousting Kawaguchi was passed despite the attempts of administration officials to defend her intentions.

2500|$|In 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is {{a symbol}} of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was {{redeemed}} through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe. In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the [...] "terrifying power" [...] of the fairies and argued that <b>they</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> play's events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethically ambivalent characters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play's audience can have no singular answer or meaning.|$|E
