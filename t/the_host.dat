5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that <b>the</b> <b>host</b> sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from <b>the</b> <b>host</b> to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by <b>the</b> <b>host.</b> If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to <b>the</b> <b>host,</b> <b>the</b> <b>host</b> sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E

50|$|The parasite's {{survival}} {{is dependent on}} a balance between host survival and parasite proliferation. T. gondii achieves this balance by manipulating <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> immune response, reducing <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> immune response and enhancing the parasite's reproductive advantage. Once it infects a normal host cell, it resists damage caused by <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> immune system, and changes <b>the</b> <b>host's</b> immune processes.|$|R
50|$|The single {{topic is}} {{discussed}} in a back-and-forth by <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> for fifteen minutes. Halfway through <b>the</b> podcast <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> introduce a book of the week, either a favorite of <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> or {{one of their own}} works. Writing Excuses has been sponsored by Audible since October 2009.

50|$|The website then {{continues}} {{in the style of}} a blog written by <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> sent to explore the world, detailing various discoveries made by <b>the</b> <b>hosts.</b> <b>The</b> blog goes on to detail how <b>the</b> <b>hosts</b> are returning to the studio to examine the pages found, and that they need more help, and will hence be sending in CBBC users to investigate further.|$|R
5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by <b>the</b> <b>host</b> bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes <b>the</b> <b>host</b> larva's pollen ball, and often <b>the</b> <b>host</b> egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E
5|$|Each country's marks are agreed {{between that}} country's leader and deputy leader and coordinators {{provided}} by <b>the</b> <b>host</b> country (the {{leader of the}} team whose country submitted {{the problem in the}} case of the marks of <b>the</b> <b>host</b> country), subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.|$|E
5|$|Frame number: This is a {{frame number}} that is {{incremented}} by <b>the</b> <b>host</b> periodically to allows endpoints {{to identify the}} start of the frame (or microframe) and synchronize internal endpoint clocks to <b>the</b> <b>host</b> clock.|$|E
25|$|The {{life-cycle}} of {{a typical}} member of this genus involves two host species, a definitive host and an intermediate <b>host.</b> Often <b>the</b> definitive <b>host</b> is a predator and <b>the</b> intermediate <b>host</b> is its prey. The parasite reproduces sexually in the gut of <b>the</b> definitive <b>host,</b> is passed with the feces and ingested by <b>the</b> intermediate <b>host.</b> There it eventually enters muscle tissue. When <b>the</b> intermediate <b>host</b> is eaten by <b>the</b> definitive <b>host,</b> <b>the</b> cycle is completed. <b>The</b> definitive <b>host</b> usually does not show any symptoms of infection, but <b>the</b> intermediate <b>host</b> does.|$|R

5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by <b>the</b> <b>host.</b> This deception provides the parasite easy entry into <b>the</b> <b>host,</b> which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict <b>the</b> <b>host</b> of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E

5|$|Many solitary wasps are parasitoids. As adults, {{those that}} do feed {{typically}} only take nectar from flowers. Parasitoid wasps are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. They then insert one or more eggs into <b>the</b> <b>host</b> or deposit them upon the outside of <b>the</b> <b>host.</b> <b>The</b> <b>host</b> remains alive until the parasitoid larvae pupate or emerge as adults.|$|E

5000|$|Each system <b>host</b> recursively enumerates <b>the</b> RapidIO fabric, seizing {{ownership}} of devices, allocating device IDs to endpoints and updating switch routing tables. When a conflict for ownership occurs, <b>the</b> system <b>host</b> with <b>the</b> larger deviceID wins. The [...] "losing" [...] host releases {{ownership of}} its devices and retreats, {{waiting for the}} [...] "winning" [...] <b>host.</b> <b>The</b> winning <b>host</b> completes enumeration, including seizing ownership of <b>the</b> losing <b>host.</b> Once enumeration is complete, <b>the</b> winning <b>host</b> releases ownership of <b>the</b> losing <b>host.</b> <b>The</b> losing <b>host</b> then discovers <b>the</b> system by reading the switch routing tables and registers on each endpoint to learn the system configuration. If <b>the</b> winning <b>host</b> does not complete enumeration in a known time period, <b>the</b> losing <b>host</b> determines that <b>the</b> winning <b>host</b> has failed and completes enumeration.|$|R
