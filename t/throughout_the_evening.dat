5|$|Using a night {{march and}} diversions by other {{segments}} of the army, General Crook secretly positioned his infantry {{to the rear of}} the Confederate line.

Crook's fighters, who were experienced in fighting in mountainous terrain, flanked the west side of the Confederate line. Crook's surprise attack broke through the Confederate lines, and was the major reason for the Union victory. Powell's cavalry brigade pushed through the gap created by Crook, and chased rebels as they fled south. The chase continued <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|E
