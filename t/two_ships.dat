The <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> were attacked by Japanese aircraft along the way, and were subsequently late in arriving at their destination, missing a planned rendezvous with HMAS Kuru. While returning to Darwin, the pair encountered Kuru south of Betano and it was decided by Castlemaines commanding officer—as the senior officer—that Armidale and Kuru should make for Betano. The <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> took different routes to Betano, during which both vessels came under aerial assault.|$|E
5|$|The M {{class was}} {{authorized}} by Plan Z in 1939, though design work started {{as early as}} 1936; these ships were intended {{to serve as the}} reconnaissance units for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned in the plan. The Navy placed very high requirements for long range, heavy armament, armor proof against guns of the ships' caliber, and high speeds, which forced the designers to compromise crucial aspects of the design, including the armor and armament, both of which were too weak. This led the design staff to rework the plans for the last <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> to rectify some of these flaws. Work began on the first <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> in 1938, but the outbreak of war in September 1939 forced the Navy to abandon work on warships that could not be completed quickly. As a result, those <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> were scrapped and the remaining four were never laid down.|$|E
5|$|The <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> laid {{a series}} of minefields during their career, though their most {{significant}} success came in October 1917, when they attacked a British convoy to Norway. They sank two escorting destroyers and nine of the twelve merchant ships from the convoy. They escaped back to Germany without damage. The <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> were interned at Scapa Flow {{after the end of}} the war, and were subsequently scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919. Brummer was sunk in deep water and was never raised, but Bremse was brought up in 1929 and broken up for scrap in 1932–1933.|$|E

Six days later, the British steamer Alhama was mined while loaded with pit props destined for Dunkirk. The 1,744-ton cargo ship was the largest ship sunk by UB-12 since the Silksworth Hall, sunk the previous April. UB-12 sank another <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> under Steindorff's command, one each in June and July.

These were the last <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> credited to mines from UB-12 for the next fourteen months.|$|E

40|$|This thesis reports {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} three-dimensional (3 D) unsteady cross flow over <b>two</b> <b>ship</b> sections located side-by-side. The ship sections have different breadth and draft conditions which represent typical situations in a ship-to-ship marine operation in a cross current. The mean flow field, vortex formation and hydrodynamic forces {{acting on the}} <b>two</b> <b>ship</b> sections are predicted by using CFD methods. The capacity of LES turbulence models for calculating such complex flow is studied. In order to do that, the numerical models were tested on several benchmark cases. When the ship is under cross flow, the hull behaves as a bluff body more than a slender structure. Before calculating the cross flow of <b>two</b> <b>ship</b> sections which has highly complex geometry and flow conditions, flow around more simple bluff body geometries are calculated and the result are compared with measurements...|$|R

5|$|In 1912, the Russian Navy sought {{builders}} {{for a pair}} {{of light}} cruisers; the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig won the contract. The <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> were originally ordered by the Russian Navy as Maraviev Amurskyy and Admiral Nevelskoy from the Schichau-Werke that year. The <b>two</b> <b>ships</b> were laid down in 1913; Maraviev Amurskyy was launched on 11 April 1914, after which fitting-out work commenced. Both ships were requisitioned by the German Navy on 5 August 1914, and were renamed Pillau and Elbing, respectively. Elbing was launched on 21 November 1914. Pillau and Elbing were commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 14 December 1914 and 4 September 1915, respectively.|$|E
