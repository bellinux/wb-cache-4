40|$|Analysis of {{unstructured}} data from social media {{is an important}} and constantly growing part of information technologies' application in the marketing context. The aims of this bachelors' thesis include creating a trial platform {{for the analysis of}} un-structured data from Facebook, research and application of suitable methods and metrics for the analysis, summarizing the analysis' findings and visualisation of selected metrics by means of a dashboard. The thesis' structure corresponds to the methods used for metting the aims set and compo-ses of seven parts. The first part summarizes motives for social media analysis, deals with the approach to the topic in the contemporary scientific papers and discusses comercial tools {{that could be used for}} such analysis. The second part describes gathering of data with a crawler, setting the connection and getting the access rights to the data sources. The structure of downloaded documents and appropriate choice of data sources is also described in this part. The third part adresses the tools used for the analysis, namely Elas-ticsearch and Kibana. The fourth part defines possible questions that may be asked in the context of Czech sports image on Facebook. The fifth part identifies the metrics necessary for the questions assesment and describes corresponding data selection. The sixth part completes the analysis itself and summarizes its findnings. The seventh part describes Ki-bana's dashboard use for effective summarizing of selected metrics. The main bachelors' thesis contribution lies in the illustration of social media analysis pos-sibilities on the example of Czech sportsmen and Czech sports in general on Facebook. A crawler has been used to gather the data for the purpose of the analysis. The other em-ployed tools included Elasticsearch and Kibana, which have enabled the data selection and visualisation. The analytical approach consisted of four parts; definition of analytical que-stions, definition of methods and metrics to find answers to <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>followed</b> by the analysis itself and the summary of results.

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is an increasingly frequent {{disease and the}} main cause of this development is seen in the rising prevalence of obesity. Both diseases are multifactorial disorders and for the pathogenesis both, environmental and genetic factors, are of crucial importance. One of the substances, which is produced from the adipose tissue as an endocrine organ, is called adiponectin. Here, high adiponectin levels are associated with a less frequent occurrence of type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}}. The topic of this thesis was therefore on the one hand to examine the role of the already established single-nucleotide-polymorphisms rs 266729, rs 17300539, rs 16861194 and their association with the circulating plasma adiponectin levels, and on the other hand, with the endpoint T 2 D. The processing of <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> <b>followed</b> in two independent cohorts to ensure an independent replication of the results. To answer these questions, the EPIC-Potsdam cohort (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) was used for one, which comprised {{at the time of the}} thesis 187 cases and 376 controls. The replication was carried out in the independent MeSy-BePo cohort (Metabolic Syndrome Berlin Potsdam), which included 2031 subjects at the time of the dissertation. The SNP analysis was performed using the SNuPE method (rs 266729, rs 17300539) and in the course of using the more efficient TaqMan technology (rs 16861194). The association of the rs 17300539 single nucleotide polymorphism with the circulating adiponectin levels could certainly be replicated in both cohorts. Heterozygous and homozygous mutants here (AG / AA) had higher circulating levels compared to wild type (GG), which confirms the results of previous studies. Concerning the promoterpolymorhism rs 266729, study participants with the wild type (CC) had higher circulating adiponectin levels compared to carriers which were hetero-, resp. homozygous for the polymorphism [association for trend : p = 0, 012 (MeSy-BePo) ]. This result could not be replicated in the EPIC-Potsdam-cohort, which therefore underlines the significance of replication within the scope of genetic association studies. For the promoterpolymorphism rs 16861194 no significant association with the circulating adiponectin levels could be detected, however in both cohorts, study participants who carried the wildtype (AA) had higher adiponectin levels compared to the heterozygous/homozygous mutant. In the MeSy-BePo-cohort with a p-value of 0. 066, a trend was evident. An association of the 3 promoterpoymorphisms with the incident resp. prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus, its precursors and indices of glucose metabolism did not shown in both cohorts and because of the presumably weak genetic effect and in this thesis the lack of statistical power in both cohorts, the acceptance of the null hypothesis is not justified. In conclusion, the results of this thesis confirm the association of the rs 17300539 with the circulating adiponectin levels. Furthermore, the results for the rs 266729 and rs 16861194 point out a feasible association and contribute to the previously very discrepant literary data available. Regarding a possible association with the incident resp. prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus, its precursors, and indices of glucose metabolism no final conclusion has to be taken in this thesis. Basically, these results demonstrate that the genetic background obviously regulates the pathophysiologically important adipose tissue hormone adiponectin...|$|E

40|$|Many authors observe an {{increasing}} pluralisation {{of the police}} function. This pluralisation implies a growing dependency between different actors in the security domain, especially on the local level. The current theoretical insights from the sociology of urban governance of security were developed dominantly within an Anglo-American and British context. This article aims to test whether these Anglo-American underlying assumptions are recognisable in European local geographical settings, more precisely in Barcelona. The underlying question {{in this article is}} whether or not the local empirical situation in Barcelona differentiates along the same lines as the general theory suggests. The Present article contributes to a European sociology of urban governance of security and our understanding of multi-layered social control theories (in) formalising in public space. The main questions we want to answer are consequently: • Can a pluralisation of policing be observed in the metropolis of Barcelona and if so, is it a consequence of European trends or because of local changes or both? • Do these changes suggest a growing attention towards public disorder (‘social disorder’, ‘incivilities’) maintenance, to the detriment of tackling (petty) crime? • Are certain (so-called ‘anti-social’) behaviours increasingly sanctioned in an exclusively local (more precisely municipal) context? Is this sanctioned administratively by means of 'by-law’ and no longer by means of traditional penal law? <b>These</b> <b>questions</b> <b>follow</b> the logic mostly developed in Anglo-American and British context.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of policies {{designed to address}} health inequalities, or more broadly speaking “differences in health”, tends to focus on evaluating policies {{in order to determine}} their effectiveness and to improve the design of future interventions. Such approaches are concerned with problem-solving as opposed to problem-questioning. Consequently there is little exploration of how the problem of “differences in health” is problematised in these policies, how policy problematisations change over time, and how governable subjects are produced as a result of problematisations of problems. Bacchi’s (1999, 2009) “What’s the problem represented to be?” framework, informed by Foucault’s theory of governmentality and methods of problematisation, archaeology and genealogy, was used to analyse 32 English public health policy documents in order to address <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>Following</b> the analysis, three problematisations of “differences in health” and their corresponding governable subjects were identified: the Informational problematisation and the “responsible chooser”; the Constraints problematisation and the “constrained chooser”; and the Paternalistic Libertarian problematisation and the “flawed chooser”. The archaeological analysis made it possible to identify underlying frameworks of thought which shaped policy problematisations of “differences in health” at specific points in time. The genealogical analysis suggested that while new problematisations emerged over time as the result of contingent conditions allowing for the development of new ideas, ultimately there was a consistent concern across all the period with understanding how individuals make choices about their health and how best to ensure people made healthy choices in order to reduce “differences in health”. This is clearly demonstrated through the identification of subjects as “choosers” and helps to explain the continuing emphasis within public health on creating the “right conditions” to allow individuals to make healthy choices, and to encourage individuals to govern themselves when making choices about their health. ...|$|R

40|$|Rural roads promote {{economic}} development, {{but they}} also facilitate deforestation. To explore this tradeoff, this article develops a spatially explicit model of land use and estimates probabilities of alternative land uses {{as a function of}} land characteristics and distance to market using a multinomial logit specification of this model. Controls are incorporated for the endogeneity of road placement. The model is applied to data for southern Belize, an area experiencing rapid expansion of both subsistence and commercial agriculture, using geographic information system (GIS) techniques to select sample points at 1 -kilometer intervals. Market access, land quality, and tenure status affect the probability of agricultural land use synergistically, having differential effects on the likelihood of commercial versus semisubsistence farming. The results suggest that road building in areas with agriculturally poor soils and low population densities may be a “lose-lose ” proposition, causing habitat fragmentation and providing low economic returns. The loss of tropical forests is a global concern because of its impact on biodiversity and climate. Roads are viewed as having precipitated much of this loss by opening forest areas to logging and agricultural conversion. This view poses a dilemma: road construction has traditionally {{been one of the most}} important tools for rural development (Creightney 1993) and, moreover, is thought to favor the rural poor (Lipton and Ravallion 1995). It is therefore important to quantify the impact of road building on both deforestation and development in order to assess the severity of the tradeoff between environmental preservation and economic growth. Although planners are aware of the deleterious effect of roads on forests, they have no empirical guidance on the extent and nature of that damage. How far from the road do conversion effects extend? What kind of conversion is induced? Whom does it benefit? In this article we propose a model that addresses <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>Following</b> von Thünen (1966), we hypothesize that lan...|$|R

The phenomenological living body is really the same of the neurophisiological one? What is the philosophical difference between culture and nature?

A multi-secret sharing scheme is the natural extension of a secret sharing scheme to the case in which many secrets need to be shared, each with respect to possibly different subsets of qualified parties. A multi-secret sharing scheme can be trivially realized by realizing a secret sharing scheme for each of the secrets. In this paper we address the natural questions of whether this simple construction is the most efficient as well, and, if not, how much improvement is possible over it, with respect to both efficiency measures used in the literature; namely, the maximum piece of information and the sum of all pieces of information distributed to all parties. We completely answer <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> as <b>follows.</b> We show the first instance for which an improvement is possible; we prove a bound on how much improvement is possible with respect to both measures; and we show instances of multi-secret sharing schemes which achieve this improvement, with respect to both measures, thus showing that the above bound is tight...|$|R

To answer some of <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> we <b>followed</b> 35 transplant recipients with diagnoses of microscopic polyangiitis (20 patients) and Wegener's granulomatosis (15 patients).

The most common immunosuppressive strategy included antibody induction, corticosteroid, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus with acute rejection occurring in eight cases. Overall and death-censored graft survivals were 94 and 100 %, respectively, 5 years post-transplantation. Nonrenal relapse occurred in three patients with a satisfactory response to treatment. No clear risk factor to relapse emerged and no detrimental effect to renal function was found. We conclude that transplantation should be considered as the treatment of choice for ESRD due to AAV.

In this case, the drainage concrete with a void content of approx. 20 - 25 % is applied in a layer thickness of 4 - 8 cm on top of the already hardened subconcrete or 'fesh in fresh' on top of the concrete which has not yet set. Since the durability of the drainage concrete (including the bond behaviour between the drainage concrete and the dense subconcrete) had still not been investigated to an adequate degree, <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were <b>followed</b> up in laboratory tests. The compressive, flexural and tensile splitting strengths are primarily influenced by the compaction, i. e. by the void content. The flexural and tensile splitting strengths can be increased by adding a polymer emulsion. The frost/de-icing salt resistance can also be improved by adding a polymer emulsion. However, it was only possible to achieve a sufficient frost/de-icing salt resistance by adding polymer emulsion and microsilica at the same time. The bond between the dense subconcrete and the drainage concrete is impaired by the frost/de-icing salt stress. (orig.)

40|$|Peer-aggression and peer-victimization {{have been}} the subject of {{considerable}} research interest over the past quarter century. There has been a focus on perpetrators of violence and aggression, based upon the belief that clarification of group and individual processes underpinning aggression will lead to effective intervention and prevention strategies. However, while it is unrealistic to hope that we can completely eradicate aggression, only by clarifying why children and young people respond in certain ways when confronted by peer-aggression can we effectively and efficiently help them to help themselves. In this way, young people can be taught resilience and practical coping skills which will help them to deal with peer-aggression when it occurs, and they can also be helped to more effectively manage emotional reactions when involved in ongoing peer-victimization. Transactional coping theory (Lazarus, 1999) provides an excellent framework for clarifying the important pathways leading to individual differences in emotional reactions and the use of coping strategies by children and young people. In the present chapter, we review the research with victims of peer-aggression which has touched on <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> and <b>follow</b> this with review of relevant studies from the stress and coping literature which shed light on the relationships between appraisals, emotions and coping strategies. We also report results from a study of our own examining these variables in a sample of children and adolescents experiencing peer-aggression, and draw conclusions for theory and practice based upon these...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{concern has}} been raised about {{possible}} health effects from exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields, especially after the rapid introduction of mobile telecommunications systems. Parents are especially concerned with the possibility that children might develop cancer after exposure to the RF emissions from mobile telephone base stations erected in or near schools. <b>These</b> <b>questions</b> have <b>followed</b> scientific reports suggesting that residence near high voltage power lines may {{to be associated with}} an increased childhood leukemia risk. Epidemiologic studies have been plagued by poor RF exposure assessment and differences in methodology. There are no high-quality epidemiologic studies {{that can be used to}} evaluate health risks from RF exposure. Laboratory studies in this area have been somewhat confusing. Some animal studies suggest that RF fields accelerate the development of sarcoma colonies in the lung, mammary tumors, skin tumors, hepatomas, and sarcomas. A substantial RF-induced increase in lymphoma incidence in transgenic mice exposed for up to 18 months has also been reported. In contrast, other studies have not found carcinogenic effects. These conflicting results indicate the need for more well-conducted studies on laboratory animals, supplemented with high-quality in vitro studies to identify effects that need further research in vivo, and to characterize any acting mechanisms, especially at low RF field levels. This paper provides a review of the laboratory studies and indicates what conclusions about RF-induced cancer can be drawn. Environ Health Perspect 1 05 (Suppl 6) : 1565 - 1568 (1997...|$|R
40|$|Abortion {{is a very}} {{controversial}} topic and over the years, many different attitudes have been formed around it. Previous studies have looked at people’s attitudes towards abortion in relation to gender, age, race, socio-economic background, religion, education and even marital status. The current study aimed to investigate the change of attitudes that students would have towards abortion given a range of circumstances (from serious to less serious). The role of gender in these attitudes was also looked at. This study conducted two separate semi-structured focus groups for each gender (6 males and 5 females). In the two focus groups, each vignette with a particular circumstance was read out to the students <b>followed</b> by <b>questions.</b> <b>These</b> <b>follow</b> up <b>questions</b> were discussed amongst the students present in the focus group. The responses from the students were recorded using a Dictaphone. From the Dictaphone, the information received from these interviews was transcribed. Thereafter, content {{analysis was used to}} analyse the findings which aimed to identify different themes. Following this, discursive constructs around abortion as well as conclusions were formed and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Are technocratic governments {{the reformers}} of last resort? And {{why are they}} appointed? Facing the ongoing European debt crisis, some {{countries}} choose to put technocrats into reform government offices, while others are able to reform their markets and fiscal structure within regularly elected governments. What differentiates these technocratic from non-technocratic governments in terms of origins and reform efforts? And are technocratic government compositions more able to implement complex market and fiscal reforms {{in a short period}} of time when facing difficult institutional settings? In order to answer <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> this research <b>follows</b> an institutional approach along rational choice theory and the concept of varieties of capitalism. A comparative study of the political economy of Greece, Ireland and Italy examines the different underpinnings that build-up to these reform governments and shows how reform efforts and forms of reform governments, understood as being either partisan or non-partisan composed, vary between different varieties of capitalism. The findings provides evidence that the varieties of capitalism configuration, and the embedded features of economic and political institutions, influence the incentives for counties to appoint technocratic governments when facing an economic crisis, thus advancing an existing model that describes the likelihood o...|$|R
