5|$|As a {{developing}} tropical cyclone over the Leeward Islands, Anna produced strong winds over Grenada, though damage {{was limited to}} some crops, trees, and <b>telephone</b> <b>poles.</b> Other islands experienced gusty winds, but no damage. Passing just north of Venezuela, the hurricane produced strong winds over the country, peaking as high as 70mph (115km/h). Strong winds caused widespread damage in northern Honduras. Throughout the country, at least 36homes were destroyed and 228were damaged. Severe damage in the Gracias a Dios Department left hundreds of people homeless. Additionally, high winds toppled approximately 5,000coconut trees. Overall, Anna caused a fatality and $300,000in damage (1961USD), primarily in Central America.|$|E
5|$|Gale force {{winds and}} heavy {{rainfall}} {{were reported in}} the lower Florida Keys; Key West reported 6.25inches (160mm) during a 24-hour period, with the maximum reported winds at a land station being 70mph (115km/h) in the Dry Tortugas. Moderate rainfall was reported throughout southern Florida and the eastern Florida Keys, as well, peaking at 16.47inches (418mm) at Tavernier. Alberto spawned three tornadoes and a waterspout in the Florida Keys, one of which at Stock Island which damaged several boats. One of the three tornadoes picked up a moving car and lightly injured the driver. Another knocked down two <b>telephone</b> <b>poles</b> on the Overseas Highway, which resulted in an hour traffic delay. Damage from the tornadoes totaled $275,000 (1982USD, $620,000 2010USD).|$|E

5|$|High surf also {{occurred}} {{along the southern}} coast of Massachusetts, prompting {{the closing of the}} ferry between Nantucket and Boston. Beryl produced a storm surge of 0.9feet (.27m) on Nantucket. Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44mph (71km/h); unofficially gusts reached 51mph (82km/h). Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97inches (24.6mm) on Nantucket. Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33inches (8.38mm) at Chatham. The only reported damage were some downed <b>telephone</b> <b>poles</b> and fallen tree branches. Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm.|$|E
5|$|Striking India on May26, {{the storm}} brought wind gusts up to 130km/h (80mph) and torrential rains, amounting to , which caused {{widespread}} damage. The hardest hit area was Midnapore {{where more than}} 10,000 homes were destroyed. At least 17 {{people were killed in}} the district alone and more than 50,000 were left homeless. Communications across Orissa were severely disrupted as broadcast stations, government buildings, and hundreds of <b>telephone</b> <b>poles</b> were destroyed. Further inland, heavy rains from the storm triggered several landslides that killed at least two people in Darjeeling Hills. Throughout eastern India, 61 people were killed and more than 500,000 were left homeless by the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} allowed {{people to}} quickly travel long distances {{and a way}} to mark routes became needed. One early means of marking routes was the establishment of various auto trail associations in the 1910s. These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on <b>telephone</b> <b>poles.</b> Most of legislative Route6 eventually became part of the Yellowstone Trail, a cross-country auto trail established in 1912 that ran from Washington to Massachusetts. In New York, the trail used modern US20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek, most of modern NY5 from Silver Creek to Albany, and modern US20 again from Albany to Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of the nearby tropical cyclone caused the delaying of two flights and the cancellation of another at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. On Guam, the United States Navy ordered the release of ships from the local harbor. There, peaked at 251mm (9.90in) over a 24-hour period at Piti. At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, a gauge observed 100mm (3.95in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at a measured 105km/h (66mph) on September4. The winds caused power outage in localized areas and downed two <b>telephone</b> <b>poles.</b> Severe flooding occurred in Merizo after a storm drain became clogged with debris, inundating six houses.|$|E
5|$|The hurricane's heavy {{rainfall}} resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain. This, combined with strong winds, damaged 60,475homes, of which 3,481 were completely destroyed. Along with other affected {{nations in the}} Caribbean, more than 100,000 were left homeless due to Hurricane Georges. A total of 1,117 businesses were also damaged, of which 12 were destroyed. High winds downed power lines, trees, and <b>telephone</b> <b>poles,</b> leaving many in eastern Cuba without electricity {{in the aftermath of}} the storm. Along the coast, severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges. Though eastern Cuba was the area most affected, the central and western portion of the island, including Havana, experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts. There, strong waves broke over the seawall, and caused heavy flood damage to some of the town's old buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually large}} wind field uprooted many {{thousands}} of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of <b>telephone</b> <b>poles</b> and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. An emergency evacuation shelter in Newport News reported minor wind damage. Two {{people in the region}} died due to falling trees—one in New Kent County and one in the city of Hopewell. Power outages left most traffic lights not working across Hampton Roads, resulting in multiple minor car accidents. Additionally, most gas stations were closed, due to power outages leaving the pumps unusable. Old Dominion University remained closed for two weeks due to storm damage and power issues, the longest it has ever been closed during a school term. Likewise, Norfolk State University, Regent University, Tidewater Community College and Eastern Virginia Medical School all experienced significant closing times due to both storm damage and a lack of electricity.|$|E

5|$|In December 1979, Roberts {{made good}} on his threats when he, {{along with the other}} top world {{championship}} riders, released a letter to the press announcing their intention to break away from the FIM and create a rival race series called the World Series. When Roberts first arrived on the Grand Prix scene, motorcycle racers were competing for as little prize money as $200, at venues such as Imatra in Finland that featured railroad crossings and hay bales wrapped around <b>telephone</b> <b>poles.</b> In 1956, the reigning 500cc world champion, Geoff Duke and thirteen other riders were given six-month suspensions for merely threatening to strike. Roberts adopted a confrontational, sometimes belligerent stance with race promoters, challenging the previously accepted poor treatment that motorcycle racers of the day were accustomed to receiving. Although the competing series failed to take off due to difficulties in securing enough venues, it forced the FIM to take the riders' demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety. During the 1979 FIM Congress, new rules were passed increasing prize money substantially and in subsequent years, stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the worst}} of the storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen <b>telephone</b> <b>poles,</b> forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane from the fields. Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E
