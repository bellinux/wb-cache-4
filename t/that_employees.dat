He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact <b>that</b> <b>employees</b> found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged <b>that</b> <b>employees</b> working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. <b>that</b> <b>employees</b> in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an unfair labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} argued, {{especially}} {{in the context of}} transition economies, <b>that</b> <b>employee</b> share ownership is motivated by the desire to protect employment-related rents. As a corollary, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>employee</b> owned firms keep inefficiently high levels of employment, or <b>that</b> <b>employee</b> owned firms would avoid ownership changes even when they would be desirable. What is usually neglected in the analysis is that ownership is often unequally divided among employees. Therefore, models which assume that the relevant objective function is the utility of the group may be misleading. This paper aims to build a framework where differences in share holding are taken into account. The decisions made reflect the preferences of the median shareholder. The results imply that when ownership among employees is sufficiently concentrated, then I) the firm may reduce employment more than would be socially optimal; II) efficiency-improving monetary transfers may not materialise; III) low- or non-owning employees will be discriminated in layoff decisions; IV) inefficient take-overs may take place. The role of mandatory severance payments is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The extant {{operations}} management literature has extensively investigated {{the associations among}} quality, customer satisfaction, and firm profitability. However, the influence of employee attributes on these performance dimensions has rarely been examined. In this study we investigate the impact of employee satisfaction on operational performance in high-contact service industries. Based on an empirical study of 206 service shops in Hong Kong, we examined the hypothesized relationships among employee satisfaction, service quality, customer satisfaction, and firm profitability. Using structural equations modeling, we found <b>that</b> <b>employee</b> satisfaction is significantly related to service quality and to customer satisfaction, while the latter in turn influences firm profitability. We also found that firm profitability has a moderate non-recursive effect on employee satisfaction, leading to a “satisfaction-quality-profit cycle”. Our empirical investigation suggests <b>that</b> <b>employee</b> satisfaction is an important consideration for operations managers to boost service quality and customer satisfaction. We provide empirical evidence <b>that</b> <b>employee</b> satisfaction {{plays a significant role}} in enhancing the operational performance of organizations in the high-contact service sector.
