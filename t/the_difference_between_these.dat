5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|The B. z. zonarius and B. z. semitorquatus {{subspecies}} have a dull black head; back, rump {{and wings}} are brilliant green; throat and breast bluish-green. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two subspecies is that B. z. zonarius has a yellow abdomen while B. z. semitorquatus has a green abdomen; {{the latter has}} also a prominent crimson frontal band that the former lacks (the intermediate shown in the box has characteristics of both subspecies). The two other subspecies differ from these subspecies by the bright green crown and nape and blush cheek-patches. The underparts of B. z. barnardi are turquoise-green with an irregular orange-yellow band across the abdomen; the back and mantle are deep blackish-blue and this subspecies has a prominent red frontal band. The B. z. macgillivrayi is generally pale green, with no red frontal band, and a wide uniform pale yellow band across the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{distance}} have elicited much controversy. Results prior to {{the launch of the}} Hipparcos satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 parsecs away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the parallax of stars in the cluster—a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous. In particular, distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting favor a distance between 135 and 140 pc; a dynamical distance from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad double Atlas favors a distance of 133–137 pc. However, the author of the 2007–2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes reasserted that {{the distance}} to the Pleiades is ~120 pc and challenged the dissenting evidence. Recently, Francis and Anderson proposed that a systematic effect on Hipparcos parallax errors for stars in clusters biases calculation using the weighted mean and gave a Hipparcos parallax distance of 126 pc and photometric distance 132 pc based on stars in the AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, and Beta Pictoris moving groups, which are all similar in age and composition to the Pleiades. Those authors note that <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> results can be attributed to random error.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{micelles}} {{was introduced to}} describe the core-corona aggregates of small surfactant molecules, however it has also extended to describe aggregates of amphiphilic block copolymers in selective solvents. It {{is important to know}} <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two systems. The major difference between these two types of aggregates is in the size of their building blocks. Surfactant molecules have a molecular weight which is generally of a few hundreds of grams per mole while block copolymers are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, thanks to the larger hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, block copolymers can have a much more pronounced amphiphilic nature when compared to surfactant molecules.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two approaches, {{and their}} impact on teen behavior, remains a {{controversial}} subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006. From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines. However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world.
