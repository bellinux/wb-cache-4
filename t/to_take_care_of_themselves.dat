2500|$|In 1902 the Kentucky state {{assembly}} unanimously {{approved the}} building of a veterans home specifically for Confederate veterans of the American Civil War by the cemetery. It was done at the behest of former Confederate officer Bennett H. Young, who had long desired such a facility as he saw many former Confederate veterans were no longer able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves.</b> After Young's group acquired $16,000, the legislation was approved. [...] Young's group of Confederate veterans and the Daughters of the Confederacy chose the Villa Ridge site just outside the cemetery, as it was well-sited and very inexpensive compared to what it had cost to build in 1889. The cemetery was established shortly after the hospital was opened, with the special monument built soon afterwards. The total area of the home and cemetery was 11,275 square feet.|$|E
2500|$|However, to Kitchener and the British Command [...] "the life {{or death}} of the 154,000 Boer and African civilians in the camps rated as an abysmally low priority" [...] against {{military}} objectives. As the Fawcett Commission was delivering its recommendations, Kitchener wrote to St John Brodrick defending his policy of sweeps, and emphasising that no new Boer families were being brought in unless they {{were in danger of}} starving. This was disingenuous as the countryside had by then been devastated under the [...] "Scorched Earth" [...] policy (the Fawcett Commission in December 1901 in its recommendations commented that: [...] "to turn 100,000 people now being held in the concentration camps out on the veldt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> would be cruelty") and now that the New Model counter insurgency tactics were in full swing, it made cynical military sense to leave the Boer families in desperate conditions in the countryside.|$|E

2500|$|... "Any {{hypothesis}} {{explaining the}} evolution of slavery in Polyergus must account both for the origin of group raiding with brood capture, and for non-independent colony foundation by queens". Topoff gives an adequate hypothesis to {{the evolution of}} Polyergus by integrating three processes: queen takeover, olfactory imprinting, and territorial fighting. Here are his main points. A free-living ancestor of Polyergus, that is a scavenger, would band together with others for intraspecific contest. Occasionally a queen would invade colonies of Formica. Initially the queen would drive off the Formica queen and workers and appropriated the Formica pupae (he gives as example the queens of Formica wheeleri that do this now). The killing of the Formica queen and adoption by the workers would evolve from this. His previous work (which was presented earlier) shows what would have evolved for adaptation to occur: [...] "(1) sharp mandibles for killing the Formica queen, (2) a pheromone that reduces aggression from resident workers, (3) a tendency to hold onto the dead Formica queen long enough to absorb her odors...". The next step would be olfactory imprinting between the two species, a consequence of living one’s life from start to finish in the presence of both species. Polyergus’ ancestor then forages and encounters a colony of the same species. Again, they recruit nestmates to a territorial raid. In a brilliant insight, Topoff suggest this trait explains the raiding behavior. The Polyergus worker, raised by Formica as conspecifics, [...] "identifies individual of Formica as belonging to its own species, another territorial raid is incited. Thus from the standpoint of Polyergus... slave raids are equivalent to territorial raids". The captured brood is imprinted as well and they become workers in the original nest. As time went on [...] "Our ancestral Polyergus could easily slide in the direction of facultative parasitism". Eventually, Polyergus ancestors lost the ability <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> and become the inquiline Polyergus we see today.|$|E
