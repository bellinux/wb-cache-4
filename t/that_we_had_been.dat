500|$|Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd {{assembled}} for {{an upcoming}} tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority {{at that time was}} the creation of new material. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that [...] "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: [...] "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – {{that a lot of the}} lyrics <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Orwell {{was in the}} {{sanatorium}} in Kent, his wife's friend Lydia Jackson visited. He {{invited her}} for a walk {{and out of sight}} [...] "an awkward situation arose." [...] Jackson was to be the most critical of Orwell's marriage to Eileen O'Shaughnessy, but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. Eileen at the time was more concerned about Orwell's closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary at Tribune which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: [...] "I was sometimes unfaithful to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, and I think she treated me badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> through awful struggles together and she understood all about my work, etc." [...] Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they had both been unfaithful. There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.|$|E

2500|$|A year afterward, some {{administration}} officials admitted {{the nature of}} US involvement. John Mecklin claimed that the White House put [...] "direct, relentless, table-hammering pressure on Diem such as the United States had seldom before attempted with a sovereign, friendly government". Trueheart went on {{to admit that the}} US was well aware of the generals' actions. He said that there were loyalty issues of publicly supporting a government while knowing that a coup was underway, but that it was [...] "greatly offset by the feeling <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> had by these people". Colby agreed with his colleagues that Richardson's removal was a major factor, regarding it as [...] "a policy decision just to indicate the end of a close relationship with Nhu". Richardson was close to Diem and the CIA provided both technical assistance and financing to Nhu's Special Forces. Trueheart insisted that Richardson had to be recalled so that Lodge could show that he spoke for the White House. Trueheart commented [...] "This was a clear signal, the only kind of really believable signal he could give".|$|E
2500|$|Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King, Jr. {{were married}} on June 18, 1953, {{on the lawn}} of her mother's house; the {{ceremony}} was performed by Martin Jr.'s father, Martin Luther King, Sr. Coretta had the vow to obey her husband removed from the ceremony, which was unusual for the time. After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to Montgomery, Alabama, in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: [...] "After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves {{in the middle of}} the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications. I felt blessed to have been called to be a part of such a noble and historic cause." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J. Liebling New Yorker short story about a {{boarding}} house for boxers, they spent [...] {{the next six months}} writing the adaptation, Sunday Punch (1942). They knew they were on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would put it all together into a single draft. We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] remember that it was a challenge convincing the powers that be <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E
