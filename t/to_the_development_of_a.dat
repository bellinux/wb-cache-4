5|$|In the mid 16th-century Russians adopted {{printing}} from Central Europe, with Ivan Fyodorov {{being the}} first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became widespread, and woodcuts became especially popular.

5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29.

5|$|Christianity led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few {{phenomena}} {{characteristic of}} Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, {{a legacy of}} Roman cultus. Also, {{the creation of a}} Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Conducive {{atmospheric}} conditions around Nanmadol on November29 led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central dense overcast, followed shortly thereafter by {{the formation of}} an eye. Nanmadol was upgraded to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on November30 and became a typhoon twelve hours later, tracking near Satawal, Woleai, and Yap State during this intensification phase. Following the upgrade to typhoon status, intensification briefly slowed but continued soon thereafter. At 0600UTC on December1, Nanmadol reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg), still east of the Philippines. The typhoon maintained this strength for roughly twelve hours before slightly weakening as it neared Luzon. At approximately 1200UTC on December2, Nanmadol made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora with winds of 140km/h (85mph).|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration.

He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} pilot {{conversion}} course, {{it became apparent}} that the AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics different from the AV-8A. These differences, as well as the digital cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training. In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986. This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.|$|E
5|$|His father distrusted or {{was jealous}} of George's popularity, which contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poor {{relationship}} between them. The birth in 1717 of George's second son, Prince George William, {{proved to be a}} catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from St James's Palace, the king's residence. The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, {{a more liberal}} {{political}} climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily {{as a champion of}} the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.|$|E

The depression moved to the north of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas, and began to show further signs of organization on August 25. After briefly weakening on August 26, the depression re-strengthened while turning to the north, and attained tropical storm status on August 27 while located 230miles (370km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
