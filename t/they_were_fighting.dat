5|$|In 986, Basil II led a {{campaign}} with 30,000 soldiers. The commanders {{of the eastern}} armies did not {{take part in the}} campaign because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> with the Arabs. The Byzantines marched from Odrin via Plovdiv to reach Sredets (Sofia). According to Leo Diaconus the objective of their Emperor was to subdue the Bulgarians with one strike. After the capture of Serdica which was a strategic fortress between the northeastern and southwestern Bulgarian lands Basil II intended to continue his campaign towards Samuil's main strongholds in Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|After a quiet {{period in}} February 1945 {{absorbing}} replacements, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army. This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz. By 19 March, Raithel's regiment had {{been converted into a}} kampfgruppe (battlegroup) consisting of two gebirgsjäger battalions, a mountain artillery battalion, a pioneer company and eight anti-tank guns. Two weeks later <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> their way out of encirclement near Limburg. On 1 April 1945, Kampfgruppe Raithel and the rest of what remained of the division drove east. Shortly afterwards, Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured. The remnants of the division disintegrated {{over the next few days}} and weeks and were captured by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Even as Texian {{governmental}} authority declined, rumors flew that Santa Anna would personally lead {{an invasion}} of Texas to quell the rebellion. Despite this news, Texian army strength continued to dwindle. Texas settlers were divided on whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for independence or {{a return to a}} federalist government in Mexico. The confusion caused many settlers to remain at home or to return home. Fewer than 100Texian soldiers remained garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas). Their commander, James C. Neill, feared that his small force would be unable to withstand an assault by the Mexican troops. In response to Neill's repeated requests for reinforcements, Governor Smith assigned Travis and 30 men to the Alamo; they arrived on February 3. Most of the Texians, including Travis, believed that any Mexican invasion was months away.|$|E

25|$|The main Bulgarian {{advantage}} {{was their}} strong patriotic spirit and high morale, {{as well as}} the feeling among the men that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for a just cause. The same could not be said about the Serbs. Their king had misled them in his manifesto to the army, telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against Turkey, and the Serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E

25|$|Like the heraldic lion, the heraldic eagle {{is seen as}} {{dominating}} the field and normally cannot brook a rival.

25|$|Initially, {{the entry}} into the war was clearly {{political}} opportunism, {{which led to a}} lack of consistency in planning, with principal objectives and enemies being changed with little regard for the consequences. Mussolini was well aware of the military and material deficiencies but thought the war would be over soon and did not expect to do much fighting. This led to confusion amongst ordinary Italians and soldiers who had little idea of what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for and, hence, had little conviction and saw little justification for it. As the war progressed and one disaster followed another, Comando Supremo were forced to take more serious steps in their planning.|$|E
25|$|In {{summer and}} autumn of 1799, the {{outbreak}} of the War of the Second Coalition brought renewed fighting to Schwyz. In mid-August the French General André Masséna drove the Austrian-Russian army out of the Schwyz valley. By the end of September <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> in the March valley. Simultaneously, the Russian General Alexander Suvorov crossed the Kinzig Pass with his army and began fighting the French in the Muota valley. Suvorov was unable to force {{his way out of the}} canton and was eventually driven over the Pragel Pass to Glarus. The destruction and looting from both armies stripped the canton of food and ruined fields, causing hardship and death among the Schwyzer during the following winter.|$|E

The message had been sent to the naval base in Horten at 04:10, but the massive communications problems that severely hampered the efforts of the Norwegian military throughout the Norwegian Campaign had prevented it from reaching Oscarsborg in time.|$|E
