5000|$|The United States had, {{since its}} early days, implicitly denied the {{doctrine}} of perpetual allegiance through its naturalization laws. President Thomas Jefferson wrote to Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin that [...] "I hold the right of expatriation to be inherent in every man {{by the laws of}} nature … the individual may such right by any effectual and unequivocal act or declaration". Other countries, however, did not recognise this position; indeed, the British Royal Navy's impressment of American sailors was one of the casus belli provoking the U.S. to join the War of 1812. Those countries' non-recognition of renunciation of their citizenship continued to cause problems for naturalized Americans {{during the course of the}} century. In the 1860s, France as well as various German and Scandinavian states attempted to conscript <b>their</b> <b>natives</b> who had become U.S. citizens when they went back to their homelands for short visits. France, Italy, and Switzerland however at least had procedures for abjuring one's original allegiance; Greece, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire did not have such procedures at all, and even sometimes punished <b>their</b> <b>natives</b> for acquiring U.S. citizenship.|$|R
