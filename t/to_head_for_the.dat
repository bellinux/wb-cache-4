5|$|Half of Harris's {{credited}} kills {{were achieved}} in October, coinciding with Japanese planners' final attempt at provoking a decisive {{battle with the}} American fleet. On October 1, 1944, while still anchored at Ulithi, Intrepid was made Admiral Bogan's flagship. The carrier disembarked from harbor on October 7 <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> waters southeast of Okinawa. It {{was scheduled to be}} part of strikes on Okinawa, the Ryukyus and Luzon leading up to a planned invasion of Leyte. These strikes began on October 10, targeting Okinawan airfields including Naha, Yontan and Ie Shima, as well as nearby shipping. Anti-aircraft fire ranged from meager to intense with flak worsening throughout the day. But, regardless of strike time, or target, there was virtually no aerial opposition encountered.|$|E
5|$|The three destroyers and 16 {{small boats}} left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the {{portside}} MLs were <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Old Mole to disembark their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire unaided, the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by Campbeltown and Atherstone.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Graf Spees Arado {{floatplane}} {{located the}} merchant ship Doric Star: Langsdorff fired a shot across her bow {{to stop the}} ship. Doric Star was able to send out a distress signal before she was sunk, which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers {{to the mouth of}} the River Plate, which he estimated would be Langsdorff's next target. On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route information. Based on that information, Langsdorff decided <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance. The ship's disguise was removed, so it would not hinder the ship in battle.|$|E
50|$|With the {{survivors}} on board CG 36500, a row developed over {{how they should}} be dealt with. Webber eventually decided against attempting to locate and transfer them <b>to</b> , <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shore instead. The survivors were safely landed at Chatham.|$|R

5|$|In 1897, {{before the}} onset of {{fighting}} in Puerto Rico, Juan Alonso Zayas, born in San Juan, was a second lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in Baler. He arrived in Manila, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of Luzon. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100km); if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.|$|E
5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{negotiated}} a truce, {{under the terms}} of which the Malagasy undertook to spare the lives of the surviving crew members. In exchange it was agreed that Meermin would return to Madagascar, where the Malagasy would be released. But gambling on the Malagasy's ignorance of navigation, the wounded Muller instead ordered his crew <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coast of southern Africa. After making landfall at Struisbaai, in the Cape Colony, which the Malagasy were assured was their homeland, 50–70 of them went ashore. Their intention was to signal to the others still on board Meermin if it was safe for them to follow, but the shore party soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to Meermins arrival; the farmers had understood that as the ship was flying no flags, it was in distress.|$|E

50|$|At Darwin, on 18 August, {{the ship}} {{embarked}} the Deputy Commander, Fleet Air Wing 10, and other men from that unit <b>for</b> transportation to <b>the</b> Admiralty Islands. After departing Australia, she proceeded to New Guinea, arriving at Milne Bay on 22 August. Pushing {{on to the}} Admiralties, the ship dropped anchor at Manus on the 24th, disembarking her passengers and fueling preparatory <b>to</b> <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ellice Islands.

5|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the initial entry into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment, but only one shell did any significant damage. It hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole through which water flooded in. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and the ship's captain decided <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. Escorted by Charlemagne in case she foundered en route, Gaulois managed to reach the islands. After temporary repairs, the ship was refloated and sailed for Toulon, escorted by Suffren. They encountered heavy weather en route and emergency repairs had {{to be made in the}} Bay of Navarin. She made Toulon without further incident where the ship was refitted and extensively modified to improve her stability, returning to the Dardanelles in July.|$|E
5|$|The UCLA Bruins {{became an}} Oregon rival {{in track and}} field as the two {{powerhouse}} programs battled each other in a series of dual meets. Oregon's program was ranked in the top 3 nationally in dual meets by Track & Field News thirteen times between 1970 and 1996 and was ranked No. 1 three times. The UCLA squad achieved a No. 1 ranking from the same publication eleven times within the same time frame. In 1966, the two programs met head <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. The Bruins displayed their dominance at the dual meet and won nine straight against the Ducks. Oregon head coach Bill Bowerman in 1971 called the Bruins team the best dual meet team in the country. It wasn't until 1978 that Oregon earned its first victory in the series, which ended UCLA's 34 dual meet winning streak. Oregon won the next three meets and the series ended in 1985 with a UCLA win. The dual meet event was fading out of favor in collegiate track and field and the Oregon-UCLA dual meet was discontinued with UCLA holding the advantage over the Ducks 10–4. In 1994, the Pepsi Team Invitational which included Oregon, UCLA and Washington was scored as a dual meet, which UCLA won. In 2008, the dual meet series between the two schools restarted and Oregon won the first three meets. Although the location of the meet had alternated between Eugene and Los Angeles between 1966 and 1976, subsequent meets have been held at Hayward Field in Oregon until 2011 where the two teams battled to a tie at UCLA. The dual meet was discontinued in 2012 due to scheduling difficulties in an Olympic year.|$|E
25|$|In late June, Soviet troops began {{constructing}} defenses around Mogilev {{and on the}} Drut River 19 kilometers to {{the west}} of the city. The city's buildings were fortified and minefields and trenches were created. Attacks from the XXXXVII Motorized Corps and the XXIV Motorized Corps were repulsed. Heinz Guderian, commander of Panzer Group 2, decided to bypass the city instead of attacking it. He ordered the XXXXVI and XXIV Motorized Corps <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sozh River.|$|E

25|$|The ships {{once again}} found {{themselves}} at Bear Island on 1 July, {{which led to}} a disagreement between Barentsz and Van Heemskerk on one side and Rijp on the other. They agreed to part ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed due north. Barentsz reached Novaya Zemlya on 17 July. Anxious to avoid becoming entrapped in the surrounding ice, he intended <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Vaigatch Strait, but became stuck within the many icebergs and floes.|$|E

25|$|Yahya ibn Muhammad's forces, meanwhile, {{had been}} {{progressively}} weakened since his {{withdrawal from the}} Nahr Maqil; an engagement with the forces of Asghajun, the governor of al-Ahwaz, had left many of his men injured, and he was lacking in cavalry after he granted his horsemen leave to return to 'Ali ibn Muhammad's camp. After learning of Abu Ahmad's movements, he abandoned his march toward the Tigris and attempted to withdraw through a swamp, {{but many of the}} Zanj fell sick during the journey. After emerging from the swamp, the Zanj vanguard under the command of Sulayman ibn Jami' found their path blocked by barges and troops sent by Asghajun, so they abandoned their own boats and decided <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> road back 'Ali's camp.|$|E

25|$|Taney {{operated}} locally out of Honolulu into 1943 before sailing for Boston {{late that}} winter. Prior <b>to</b> <b>heading</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> east coast, the ship received a re-gunning at Mare Island, being fitted with four single-mount 5-inch guns, making her the only ship {{in her class}} with this modification. After making port at Boston on 14 March 1944, Taney soon shifted south to Hampton Roads, where she arrived on 31 March 1944. Early in April, she departed Norfolk as a unit of Task Force 66 (TF 66) as convoy guide <b>for</b> convoy UGS-38. <b>The</b> passage across the Atlantic proved uneventful, as the convoy made landfall off the Azores on 13 April 1944.|$|R
25|$|On completion, Melbourne sailed from Portsmouth for Australia, {{arriving}} in Fremantle on 10 March 1913.

Melbourne returned to Sydney on 20 September, and on 1 November joined the escort of the convoy transporting the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to Egypt. The cruiser left the convoy while in the Indian Ocean, and headed for Gibraltar, where she was then instructed <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Azores in search of the German cruiser SMS Karlsruhe.|$|E
25|$|Two other Marine groups became {{isolated}} in the fighting along the perimeter. One platoon from 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment—scouting the Japanese flank position—slipped through the jungle and passed by the enemy force without being observed. Choosing <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beach instead of the interior, the platoon struggled to the coast. There, the patrol cleaned its weapons with gasoline from a wrecked barge, and {{spent the night in}} the jungle. The next morning, the attention of an Allied plane was attracted and within an hour the platoon was picked up by a tank lighter and returned to the main lines. The other isolated unit—a patrol from Company B—was cut {{off from the rest of}} the battalion during the fighting and spent the night of 7–8 November behind Japanese lines without detection.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} a third destroyer, HMS Contest steamed into Sparrowhawk, {{striking}} six feet from her stern. Contest was relatively unharmed {{and able to}} continue underway after the collision. Broke and Sparrowhawk remained wedged together for {{about half an hour}} before they could be separated and Broke got underway, taking 30 of Sparrowhawks crew with her. Broke remained able to manoeuvre, although she had lost her bow. At around 1.30 AM the ship again encountered German destroyers which fired about six rounds into Broke, which managed to return one shot before the ships separated. The ship proceeded slowly towards Britain but by 0600 on 2 June found that she could no longer travel into the high seas with her damaged bow and had to turn back towards Heligoland. The seas abated and the ship was able <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tyne, arriving some two and a half days after the engagement.|$|E

Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.|$|E
