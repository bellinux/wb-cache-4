5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1858, during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, a group of gold prospectors from Lawrence, Kansas {{established}} Montana City as a mining town {{on the banks of}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River in what was then western Kansas Territory. This was the first historical settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and by {{the summer of}} 1859 it was abandoned in favor of Auraria (named after the gold-mining town of Auraria, Georgia), and St. Charles City.|$|E
5|$|Some Denver streets have bicycle lanes, {{leaving a}} {{patchwork}} of disjointed routes throughout the city. There are over 850 miles of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte.</b> This allows for {{a significant portion of}} Denver's population to be bicycle commuters and has led to Denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city. Some local residents are very opposed to bike lanes, which have caused some plans to be watered down or nixed. The review process for one bike line on Broadway will last over a year before city council members will make a decision. In addition to the many bike paths, Denver launched B-Cycle– a citywide bicycle sharing program– in late April 2010. The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States {{at the time of its}} launch, boasting 400 bicycles.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} 1832 to 1856, traders, trappers, and {{settlers}} established trading posts and small settlements along the Arkansas River, and on <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> near the Front Range.

25|$|Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops, {{and most}} of the villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator. Irrigation water is {{available}} from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte,</b> the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including artesian wells. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline. As well as crop agriculture, eastern Colorado hosts considerable livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.|$|E
25|$|Indian attacks {{increased}} significantly after 1860, {{when most of}} the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country, often encroaching on Indian territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the Central Nevada Route. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the Indian trouble nearer the Snake River. Other trails were developed that traveled further along <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> to avoid local Indian hot spots.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{interior}} of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, {{on the east side of}} the Continental Divide is the North Park of Colorado. The North Park is drained by the North Platte River, which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska.

25|$|The {{story begins}} in the mid-18th century among the Native American tribes {{of what is now}} {{northern}} Colorado. A young Arapaho boy named Lame Beaver grows up during this period.

25|$|Within the {{interior}} of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks or high broad basins. In the north, {{on the east side of}} the Continental Divide is North Park. North Park is drained by the North Platte River, which flows north into the northwest state of Wyoming. Just south but on the west side of the Continental Divide is Middle Park, drained by the Colorado River. South Park is the headwaters of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River. To the south lies the San Luis Valley, the headwaters of the Rio Grande, which drains into New Mexico. Across the Sangre de Cristo Range to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the Wet Mountain Valley. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the Rio Grande Rift, a major tectonic feature. See Rift.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the peace}} council held at Bent's Fort in 1840, the Algonquian-speaking Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho were allied against their {{traditional}} enemies, the Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache, who belonged to different language families and cultures. In 1837, while raiding the Kiowa horse herds along the North Fork of the Red River, a party of 48 Cheyenne Bowstring Men were discovered and killed by Kiowa and Comanche warriors. Porcupine Bear, chief of the Dog Soldiers, took up the war pipe of the Cheyenne. He carried it to the various Cheyenne and Arapaho camps to drum up support for revenge against the Kiowa. He reached a Northern Cheyenne camp along <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River just after it had traded for liquor from American Fur Company men at Fort Laramie.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, <b>the</b> upper <b>South</b> <b>Platte</b> River valley had been {{infiltrated}} by fur traders, {{but had not}} been the site of permanent settlement. The first movement of permanent U.S. settlers in the area began with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed private land claims to be filed. Among the first settlers to establish claims were former fur traders who returned to the lands they once trapped, including Antoine Janis and other trappers from Fort Laramie, who established a town near Laporte along the Cache la Poudre in 1858.|$|R
