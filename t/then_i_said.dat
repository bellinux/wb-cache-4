500|$|Ray Davies {{has claimed}} that he was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Lola" [...] after Kinks manager Robert Wace spent a night in Paris dancing with a transgender woman. Davies said of the incident, [...] "In his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, 'I'm really onto a thing here.' And it was okay until we left at {{six in the morning}} and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Have you seen the stubble?' He said 'Yeah', but he was too pissed [...] to care, I think".|$|E
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I thought it was great. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Superstar" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, Hardy [...] "Indigo" [...] Muanza and Michael Malih and was recorded at MSR Studios in New York City. After {{the completion of}} MDNA, critics around the world were invited to Abbey Road Studios for an initial review of the album. Many critics noted that Madonna's daughter Lourdes' vocals appeared in [...] "Superstar", which was subsequently confirmed by the singer herself. When Madonna was talking to The Sun about her daughter's collaboration, she said: [...] " [...] just {{came over to the}} studio that day. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, can you sing this part?' and she agreed to." [...] Further explanation about Lourdes' singing on the track was given: ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>Then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing, she resumed: [...] "That {{day after}} school I saw Uncle Charlie and told him, and he said: 'What! you allowed that tramp to kiss you! <b>then</b> <b>I</b> don't {{want to take you}} on my knee any more--you've lowered {{yourself}} too much." ...|$|R
500|$|Despite {{retiring}} officially {{from the}} company, Marcus {{continued to be}} closely involved as an advisor even through the final weeks of his life. He established a sideline as a retailing consultant, maintaining regular business hours in his offices at Crescent Court {{for more than a}} decade and offering advice locally to luxury car dealership Sewell Corporation and hotelier Rosewood Corporation as well as internationally to such businessmen as Mohamed Al-Fayed of Harrods. Called on to consult for Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, the 94-year-old businessman recalled arriving in his customary expensive tailored suit to discover 300 casually dressed employees: [...] "I took off my coat, my necktie and my shirt, down to my T-shirt. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Okay. Let’s talk.' I couldn’t have planned it better. It broke the ice. I was on stage for two hours." ...|$|E
500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle. In an interview, Grande explained: [...] "It's very unique, it's very different, I called Max [...] up and I said 'hey I want to do something that ends exactly like this' and I described the ending shot to him and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I also want it to be (a) one take … and I want the ending shot to look like this, And I described those two things to him and he’s like, 'wow, that's ambitious and it’s brave and it’s different, but let's try it". A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E
2500|$|After a {{shoot-out}} in Ohio in 1992, {{he faced}} {{eight years in}} jail. [...] "When they said 'not guilty', my face stuck in a smile for three days," [...] he recalled. [...] "I was just walking around town, thinking about my daughter and my wife. Right <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> goodbye to anything that would put me in that situation again. I was up on trial on an attempted murder charge. I was a motherfucking fool, with all that knowledge {{in my head and}} ending up there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hogs!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> so sarcastic, that Jone {{looked hard}} at me, but I didn't tell him {{anything}} more till we {{was in the}} boat, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> right out what had happened. Jone couldn't help laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> {{will trust}} you," [...] {{returned}} Dechamp, extending his hand, which the Indian gravely grasped; [...] "and I {{will give you}} undeniable proof, by giving my young men orders to start after the buffalo at once--without further delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! Wal, {{what the}} hell!" [...] rejoined Colter. [...] "We shore did all we could. I reckon y'u think it wasn't {{a tough job}} to pack him up the Rim. He was done for <b>then</b> an' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so." ...|$|R
2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous; but the wicked and him who loves {{violence}} His soul hates," [...] bear on God's instruction in [...] "Take the Levites." [...] The Midrash taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord tries the righteous," [...] imply that God never raises a person to high rank before first testing and trying that person. If the person stands the trial, God raises the person to high rank. The Midrash found this {{to have been the}} case with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and so also with the tribe of Levi. The Midrash taught that the Levites devoted their lives to the sanctification of God's Name. When the Israelites were in Egypt, the Israelites rejected the Torah and circumcision, as implied by Ezekiel's rebuke of them in [...] "Thus says the Lord God: 'In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt'"; and afterwards, [...] says, [...] "They rebelled against Me, and would not hearken to Me [...] [...] [...] <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I would pour out My fury upon them." [...] So God brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and during that time God slew all the wicked Israelites, as [...] reports, [...] "I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against Me." [...] The Levites, however, were all righteous and practiced the Torah; as [...] says, [...] "For they have observed Your word, and keep Your covenant." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] "covenant" [...] referred to circumcision, as [...] says, [...] "This is My covenant [...] [...] [...] every male among you shall be circumcised." [...] And the Midrash taught that when the Israelites made the Golden Calf, the Levites did not participate, as [...] says: [...] "Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp [...] [...] [...] and all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him." [...] When Moses told them in [...] "Put every man his sword upon his thigh," [...] they did so and respected no persons. Moses accordingly blessed them in [...] saying, [...] "Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him.'" [...] When God thus saw that the Levites were all righteous, and that they stood the test, as [...] says, [...] "Whom You did prove at Massah," [...] God decided, as reported in [...] "The Levites shall be mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} sorry, <b>then,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> a {{word about}} it: but the whole parish talks of it," [...] answered Tom, who was surprised at this fresh proof of the little confidence which Aberalva put in their parson.|$|R
6000|$|I was dumfounded {{by such a}} proposition, {{and it is not}} {{impossible}} that my knees began to shake as I thought of attempting such a thing. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> suddenly remembered that we had no weapons aboard, except an old musket which we used to shoot into a flock of ducks now and <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> with a laugh: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ho, ho! damn it, <b>I</b> must go <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> suppose,' <b>said</b> Festus, laughing; {{and unable}} to get a further glance from her {{he left the room}} and clanked into the back yard, where he saw a man; holding up his hand he cried, 'Anthony Cripplestraw!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I gulped. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it {{was nothing}}. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{it was nothing}} much. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, well, it was this way." [...] And, after a few brief remarks about Jimmy Pinkerton, I told her all about it. And all the while Idiot Freddie stood there gaping, without a word.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> good-night {{and turned}} in, and dreamt about poor long-dead Silvestre and the diamonds.|$|E
6000|$|... "In East Har--" [...] I came {{to myself}} and stopped, a little confused; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Never mind, now; I'll tell you some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{offers a}} {{thousand}} gold florins," [...] he muttered, [...] "in addition to Gonzaga's liberty and advancement. Why, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> {{no more than}} was true when I assured the men that Gian Maria was but idly threatening us with bombardment. Keep this matter secret, Peppe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That look of hers {{gave me an}} idea. 'Now <b>then,</b> doc,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{and tried}} to sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so. 'A slight sprain,' {{explained}} the doctor. 'Nothing serious. You'll be about again {{in a couple of}} days.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> {{was robbed}} {{by a man}} and a boy. I had dear little Pompey with me at the time, and that is the way I came to lose him. But the terrible thing was that an {{accident}} befell me just after I was robbed, and I never saw my darling grandmother again--" ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{turned her}} face a little more into profile, looking at the steep gray house-fronts {{opposite}} to her. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I shall speak to her myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even <b>then,</b> no," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "At {{least not}} now. They {{have been too}} oppressed by us to trust {{anything}} with a Roman name for years and years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, <b>then.</b> As <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{this one}} was not a {{favorite}} in the family, {{and so he was}} neglected in every way, never sent to school, always allowed to associate with the worst and coarsest characters, and so of course he has grown up a rude, vulgar, ignorant, dissipated ruffian, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a child}} {{going along}} out there {{and asked me if}} the postman had been by and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> yes, and she said how long since I saw him and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> hadn't seen him at all, and she <b>said</b> how did <b>I</b> know he'd been by, <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> because <b>I</b> smelt his track on the sidewalk, and she <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a dum fool and made a mouth at me.

6000|$|... "Ah-ha! It returns, <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{the thing}} was Death. How comes it that thou art still alive?" [...] the old Cobra mumbled, twining lovingly round the ankus-haft.|$|E
