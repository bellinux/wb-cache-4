5|$|Barkley {{was popular}} with the fans and media and made the NBA's All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was {{frequently}} involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and as in 1993 when he declared <b>that</b> <b>sports</b> figures {{should not be considered}} role models. Short for a power forward, Barkley used his strength and aggressiveness {{to become one of the}} NBA's most dominant rebounders. He was a versatile player who had the ability to score, create plays, and defend. In 2000, he retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, 1917, Baker {{played his}} last hockey {{game at the}} Winter Garden at Exposition Hall in Pittsburgh. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team {{defeated}} Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3â€“2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken its toll, and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief <b>that</b> <b>sports</b> should be played {{for the love of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says <b>that</b> <b>sports</b> mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E

Therefore, sport {{as a tool of}} development has a profile with extremely high expectations and is consequently widely applied by various international, national and local organizations. In many cases, it is believed <b>that</b> <b>sport</b> has potential to build capacity in individuals and society in general. It has been noted <b>that</b> <b>sport</b> has been increasingly used in hope to enhance development interventions, especially when centering on gender equality and empowerment of women. However bold assertion <b>that</b> <b>sport</b> is a tool for achieving gender equality and women empowerment, through exclusively participation in sporting activities is based on limited information and lack of evidence...|$|R

ABC purchased Sports Programs, Inc. in exchange for shares in the company, leading it to become the future core of ABC Sports, with Arledge as {{the executive producer of}} that division's shows. Wide World of Sports, in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events.|$|E

500|$|Social science {{research}} gives {{weight to the}} perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies support the view <b>that</b> <b>sports</b> mascots and images are not trivial. Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute {{to all of the}} other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty. European Americans exposed to mascots are more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a [...] "spreading effect".
