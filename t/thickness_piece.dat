40|$|International audienceA new hybrid welding {{technique}} {{has recently been}} developed in order to answer to the industry needs to gather high thickness steel sheets. The combination of a laser beam and a gas metal arc enables to develop welds with a high added metal rate and low porosity. Moreover lower deformation and residual stresses are observed after cooling. Nevertheless the mastery of this technique is still in development due to the various physical phenomena which occur and interact during the welding process. A three dimensional finite element model has been developed to simulate this welding process. Metal and air gas domains are both meshed. A Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is used in which the interface between the metal and the surrounding air or plasma is defined by a level set function. Fluid flow phenomena and temperature evolution in the weld pool are simulated. Two moving heat sources are considered at {{the surface of the}} metal. As the arc plasma and laser beam are not modeled in the level set framework, the 'Continuum Surface Force' approach is used: a volumetric heat source distribution is applied to the immediate neighbourhood of the interface. The added metal represents an additional heat source. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved in the weld pool regarding the surface Marangoni force, the volumetric buoyancy. After solving the momentum conservation equation, metal / air interface is tracked through the resolution of a convection equation with the calculated velocity field as input. As the hybrid {{welding technique}} is usually a multi-pass process applied on high <b>thickness</b> <b>piece</b> with high chamfer, it is of primary importance to develop a correct modeling of solid / solid contact interfaces. It is shown that the present level set approach coupled with an adaptative remeshing tool enables to follow these interfaces to simulate the entire process steps. Weld geometry on a specific steel alloy is shown and compared to the expected result...|$|E

40|$|Issue: Crushed, graded {{recycled}} glass {{can be an}} attractive ground cover or plant mulch. Before designing glass into any landscape project, however, the designer should have {{a thorough understanding of}} how to specify the glass. Best Practice: The designer considering using crushed glass for landscaping should consider all of the issues below. Gradation Usually the designer will not want glass to look like broken bottles. Because of the platy nature of glass, if the glass is much larger in maximum dimension than the thickness of a container or a window, many of the pieces will look like broken bottles. For example, containers and windows are usually 1 / 4 -inch or less in <b>thickness.</b> <b>Pieces</b> larger than 1 / 4 -inch will have a flat dimension over twice the <b>thickness.</b> Also, some <b>pieces</b> will show the curvature of the container. In addition, larger pieces will not have been processed by the type of “tumbling ” processor described below, {{and are more likely to}} have sharp edges. Generally, 3 / 8 -inch and finer glass should be used in landscape projects. Dust The designer should consider the finest size desired in the landscape project. Glass pieces smaller than 100 mesh can become airborne dust, will slow down the drainage of water through the glass, and will wash to the bottom of the glass layer. The designer should consider whether the installation is in a locatio...|$|R
50|$|Second {{dilemma is}} the biopsy technique. Even though excisional biopsy (removing the entire lesion) is ideal, and {{advocated}} by pathologists; practical reason dictates {{that this should}} not be done. These tumors are often large and presenting on the facial area. Excision of such large tumor would be absolutely contraindicated if the lesion's identity is uncertain. The preferred method of diagnosis is by using a punch biopsy, allowing the physician to sample multiple full <b>thickness</b> <b>pieces</b> of the tumor at multiple sites. While one section of the tumor might show benign melanocytic nevus, another section might show features concerning for severe cellular atypia. When cellular atypia is noted, a pathologist might indicate that the entire lesion should be removed. It is at this point that one can comfortablly remove the entire lesion, and thus confirm the final diagnosis of lentigo maligna. The size of the punch biopsy can vary from 1 mm to 2 mm, but it is preferable to use a punch 1.5 mm or larger. Representative samples of the most atypical parts of the nevus should be biopsied, often guided by dermatoscopy.|$|R

Chondrocytes are {{responsible}} for the production of the ECM (Meachim and Stockwell 1973; Buckwalter and Mankin 1998; Cohen et al. 1998), since they are likely to synthesize collagen type II and proteoglycans (Schulz and Bader 2007; Spiller et al. 2011). Four different constructs were used to culture chondrocytes: a) explants, which consist of a complete section of cartilage that is excised from a cadaver and embedded in a culture medium (Parkkinen et al. 1993) (Table  1), b) tissue engineered meshes that have a structural 3 D shape (Table  2), c) monolayers that consist of isolated chondrocytes from full <b>thickness</b> <b>pieces</b> of cartilage seeded onto a plate (Jortikka et al. 2000; Smith et al. 2000) (Tables  3 – 4), d) hydrogels that have a softer structure compared to meshes (Carver and Heath 1999 b; Hu and Athanasiou 2006) (Tables  3 – 4).

The study is focused on the scaling performance of NRC-OCRE EG/AD/S model ice with respect to piece size generation. This study has shown the non-dimensional piece size decreases and approaches that found in full scale beyond a certain thickness, i. e., 9 cm. We tested the Polar Icebreaker model in EG/AD/S model ice at 8 cm and 10. 4 cm, and at this range we expect the similar thickness dependency follows.
