He preferred to play as a central midfielder, although was able <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side of midfield and was equally comfortable playing with either foot.|$|E
5|$|McCarty {{played a}} role as a {{receiver}} and special teams player in 2013, but was almost entirely absent from the rushing game. He rushed for 48 yards on 9 carries, but caught 20 passes for 186 yards and two touchdowns. He continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> special teams, and recorded nine special-teams tackles.|$|E

5|$|A {{student at}} Van Meter High School, Feller was a {{starting}} pitcher for the school's baseball team. During {{this time he}} continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Farmers Union team in the American Amateur Baseball Congress, and had 19 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season. He also was the starting center for the high school basketball team. By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality fastball; major league scouts traveled to Dayton, Ohio to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but {{he had already been}} signed to a professional contract with the Cleveland Indians.|$|E
5|$|After a {{recruiting}} battle between Louisiana State University and the University of Texas, Tittle chose to attend LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and {{play for the}} LSU Tigers. He {{was part of a}} successful 1944 recruiting class under head coach Bernie Moore that included halfbacks Jim Cason, Dan Sandifer, and Ray Coates. Freshmen were eligible <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> varsity during World War II, so Tittle saw playing time immediately. He later said the finest moment of his four years at LSU was beating Tulane as a freshman, a game in which he set a school record with 238 passing yards. It was one of two games the Tigers won that season.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E

5|$|At school, {{a wealthy}} schoolmate of Kiat Kun's named Tan Beng Soon (Joshua Ang) runs an amateur {{football}} team with his friends. Kiat Kun {{and his friends}} strike a bargain with Beng Soon <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team using the other boys' football shoes, in exchange for helping them cheat on their homework. However, the boys quarrel, causing an angry Beng Soon to renege on the deal and remove Kiat Kun and his friends from the team.|$|E
5|$|Byte {{magazine}} {{published an}} assembly language version of Spacewar in 1977 that {{ran on the}} Altair 8800 and other Intel 8080-based microcomputers using an oscilloscope as the graphical display and a lookup table for orbits, {{as well as a}} three-dimensional variant in 1979 written in Tiny BASIC. More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> internet in 2012. The only working PDP-1s that are known to exist are kept in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, where demonstrations of the machine are held, which include playing Spacewar.|$|E
5|$|During Hunt's injury, Bennett moved Broncos {{teammate}} Justin Hodges to fullback and Hodges {{was impressive}} in the position. When Hunt {{returned to the}} Broncos side in Round 25 against the Parramatta Eels, he was forced <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing due to Hodges' good form. Hunt and Hodges continued to switch the fullback position {{for the remainder of}} the season. Hunt missed the first week of the finals due to a hamstring problem but was able to return a week later.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Bob Ward {{returned}} to his alma mater to take the head coaching position. Before the season, 12 players failed to academically qualify <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team. During that first season, the team lost all nine of their games {{for the first time}} in the modern era. Ward's second year saw slight improvement, recording eight losses but with wins over North Carolina and South Carolina. However, many of his players were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style.|$|E
5|$|In Oracle of Ages, {{the central}} item is the Harp of Ages, which Link uses to {{manipulate}} time and travel between {{the past and}} the present. In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> harp. The Tune of Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the Tune of Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the Tune of Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-anagrams: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is Edward Kelley, a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, {{began as an}} anagram for Rasputin. Viewers are told that the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated {{that part of the}} legend, along with allusions to the Salem witch trials and Arthur Miller's 1953 play The Crucible, <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> themes of injustice done on those who were called witches.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{nevertheless}} obtained {{an injunction}} from a Virginia court {{to allow him}} to participate in the game, which was being held in Louisiana. In response, the NCAA threatened to remove the Independence Bowl's certification if Smith was allowed to play. When the bowl forbade Smith from participating, he obtained a restraining order from a Louisiana court to force the Independence Bowl to allow him <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> day of the game, the NCAA attempted to appeal the decision to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals, but a three-judge panel denied the appeal. By this time, the game was about to begin, and Smith was allowed to play.|$|E

5|$|The Modern Benoni {{is one of}} Black's sharpest {{and most}} active defences against 1.d4. The {{exchange}} of White's c-pawn for Black's e-pawn leaves White with a pawn majority in the centre and Black with one on the queenside. This asymmetry suggests that White will try <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kingside and in the centre, while Black will seek counterplay on the queenside. However, this simplistic generalization does not hold in many cases—depending on how the pieces are arranged, either side {{may be able to}} fight back on the flank where they are theoretically weaker.|$|E

While some critics found the album uneven, Ki received generally positive reviews for its unexpected musical direction, {{along with its}} production, vocal dynamics, and mix of influences.|$|E
