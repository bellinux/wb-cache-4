5|$|The first Jesuit {{reduction}} in the Chiquitania was the mission of San Francisco Xavier, founded in 1691 by the Jesuit priest Fr. José de Arce. In September 1691, de Arce and Br. Antonio de Rivas intended to meet seven other Jesuits at the Paraguay River to establish a connection between Paraguay and Chiquitos. However, {{the beginning of the}} rainy season brought bad weather, and Arce and his companion only got as far as the first native village. The local Piñoca tribe, who were suffering from a plague, begged Arce and Rivas to stay and promised <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> and a church for the Jesuits, which were finished by the end of year. The mission was later moved a number of times until 1708 when it was established in its present location.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area had the right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and {{to live with her}} family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E

25|$|The form of {{the houses}} was also {{constrained}} by the narrow lots, resulting in buildings much deeper than they were wide.

25|$|Lewis Vulliamy, who was {{a notable}} {{architect}} of that time, was instructed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> in which a central staircase was a major feature. The main purpose of the building was to house the extensive collection of paintings that Holford had acquired over many years {{and at that time}} were temporarily lodged in a friend's residence in Russell Square. Vulliamy's assistant in this project was Jacob Wrey Mould. The 19th-century architecture critic Clarence Cook attributes the grand staircase specifically to Mould, who undertook that task while Vulliamy was incapacitated. Mould subsequently went on to work with Calvert Vaux on many of the initial buildings and design details of New York's Central Park, very notably, Bethesda Terrace.|$|E
