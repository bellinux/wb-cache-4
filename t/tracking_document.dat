As a first step towards this vision, in this work we investigate whether different document types can be automatically de-tected from visual behaviour recorded using a mobile eye tracker. We present an initial recognition approach that com-bines special purpose eye movement features as well as ma-chine learning for document type detection. We evaluate our approach in a user study with eight participants and five Japanese document types and achieve a recognition perfor-mance of 74 % using user-independent training.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the 3. 5 years experience of integrating digital mammography with a generalized Picture Archiving Communications System (PACS). Rather than implement a mammography mini-PACS solution (dedicated solely for use in full-field digital mammography), the vision was to integrate full-field digital mammography with the preexisting PACS archive, network, and Web distribution system from the beginning. Our enterprise still utilized a separate proprietary mammography reading workstation, {{as required by the}} FDA at that time. The pros, cons, and lessons learned from this approach are presented. The enterprise is currently transitioning away from a separate mammography reading station. This transition will more fully integrate, using the overall PACS for mammography reporting, mammography <b>tracking,</b> <b>document</b> imaging module may be added in the future, management reporting, task tracking, and billing output with a single unified RIS/PACS solution.

40|$|Analysis {{of large}} text data sets is gaining {{popularity}} providing the users some insights {{into their own}} (potentially even very unstructured) data sets that where difficult to get using the standard methods. This kind of data analysis differs from the standard analysis in the following three directions: (1) the used methods for data analysis differ from the standard statistical methods, (2) the data we are analyzing have different characteristics than the standard, structured data bases, and (3) the users of the data analysis results have different needs and requirements than the usual users of common analytical services (statistics, data-mining, OLAP). This paper gives a brief idea of the area addressing that kind of data analysis {{commonly referred to as}} Text-Mining. It is a growing area placed at the intersection of Information-Retrival (IR), Data-Mining (DM), Machine-Learning (ML), Natural-Language-Processing (NLP).

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} the authors 2 ̆ 7 experience with expanding the routine peer-review process to include misdiagnoses from all sources {{and the use of}} focused peer review (FPR) in faculty accountability and management. METHODS: A department-wide routine peer review was conducted. Each radiologist was assigned 12 cases per month. In addition, clinically reported errors, missed diagnoses discovered outside the routine peer-review process, were identified. Cases were scored from 1 to 5. The department quality office evaluated cases with scores of 3 and 4 from both sources for further processing with FPR, a multistep continuation of the peer-review process using a <b>tracking</b> <b>document.</b> Once initiated, FPR was processed by seeking comments from the division director and the interpreting radiologist. In some cases, FPR was discontinued before completion. Completed FPR documents were submitted to the department chair for administrative action, ranging from no action to termination. All FPR cases are presented at monthly departmental morbidity and mortality conferences. RESULTS: Routine peer review was done on 1, 646 cases from a total of about 300, 000 studies by 31 radiologists. Thirty-five cases from the two sources with scores of 3 and 4 were analyzed, 21 from the routine peer review and 14 clinically reported errors. The quality officer initiated 25 FPRs, rejecting 10 because errors were not considered significant. Further scrutiny lead to dropping 7 of the 12 routine and 2 of the 13 cases with clinically reported error. Sixteen FPRs were completed, 5 (31...|$|E
