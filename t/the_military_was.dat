5|$|<b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{organized}} along similar {{lines to}} the British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of reconciling the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{complaints}} by {{family members of the}} victims and others that <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> failing to hold its personnel accountable, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military's response to it. Also, Ronald R. Fogleman, the USAF's new Chief of Staff, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> {{involved}} in the breeding of Arabian horses throughout Europe, particularly in Poland, Spain, Germany, and Russia; private breeders also developed a number of breeding programs.

5|$|Ahead of the storm, over 24,000people {{evacuated}} Philippines's northeastern {{province of}} Aurora. Many radio stations, typically which close during Easter, remained operational to broadcast the storm. Officials issued storm warnings, and <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> on alert. Beaches were closed, boats {{were ordered to}} remain at port, and 10flights were canceled. The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that ₱300.9million (US$6.8million) worth of funds and supplies were available for possible relief efforts. Approximately 28,000family food packs were prepositioned in warehouses across Luzon.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} tensions escalated in {{the years}} leading to World War II, the Belgian government again announced its intention to remain neutral {{in the event of}} war in Europe. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> reorganised into a defensive force and the country left several international military treaties it had joined in the aftermath of World War I. Construction began of defences in the east of the country. When France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Belgium remained strictly neutral while mobilising its reserves.|$|E
5|$|Australian Army {{units were}} {{gradually}} {{withdrawn from the}} Mediterranean and Europe following the outbreak of war with Japan. However, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy units and personnel continued {{to take part in}} the war against Germany and Italy. From 1942 until early 1944, Australian forces played a key role in the Pacific War, making up the majority of Allied strength throughout much of the fighting in the South West Pacific theatre. While <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> largely relegated to subsidiary fronts from mid-1944, it continued offensive operations against the Japanese until the war ended.|$|E

5|$|During these events, no gunshots were fired. The {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> <b>was</b> a sign of approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's wealth, however, made it {{a tempting}} target for invasion, {{particularly}} by the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, by 1795, {{the army}} had already made itself odious, by both rumor and action, {{throughout}} France through its dependence upon the countryside of material support and its general lawlessness and undisciplined behavior. After April 1796, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> paid in metallic value, not the worthless paper, but pay was still well in arrears. The French Directory believed that war should pay for itself and did not budget to pay, feed, and equip its troops. Thus, a campaign that would take the army out of France became increasingly urgent for both budgetary and internal security reasons.|$|E

5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock. Val Hancock entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1925 and {{graduated}} as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> engineering, {{and it was only}} when he found that there was no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook flying instruction at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E
5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's {{decision to go to}} war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced by the arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.|$|E

5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E
5|$|That same year, then-Lieutenant Olga E. Custodio {{became the}} first female Hispanic U.S. {{military}} pilot. Custodio studied at the University of Puerto Rico and joined their ROTC program. She graduated from the Officer Training School in January 1980, and was commissioned a second lieutenant. She holds {{the distinction of being}} first Latina to complete U.S. Air Force undergraduate pilot training (UPT). One of her assignments in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> that of instructor pilot where she was the first female Northrop T-38 Talon UPT flight instructor at Laughlin AFB.

5|$|The GCV {{must have}} been {{transportable}} by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by {{the dimensions of the}} C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> <b>was</b> accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.|$|E
