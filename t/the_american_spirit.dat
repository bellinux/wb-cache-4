25|$|Even {{with the}} wealth of perspectives, {{including}} the commander's, it is difficult if not impossible to tell exactly what occurred. It is clear, however, that the crew felt alienated by their commander, who {{might well have been}} motivated by his pride. Jones believed his intentions were honorable, and his actions were strategically essential to the Revolution. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the mission, Ranger's capture of Drake was one of the Continental Navy's few significant military victories during the Revolution, and was of immense symbolic importance, demonstrating as it did that the Royal Navy was far from invincible. By overcoming such odds, Ranger's victory became an important symbol of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>spirit</b> and served as an inspiration for the permanent establishment of the United States Navy after the revolution.|$|E

Indeed the Englishman really is well represented by Robin Hood; for there is always something about him that may literally be called outlawed, in the sense of being extra-legal or outside the rules.

A majority of the council, including Clinton and Grant, advised that a force should be landed on Charlestown Neck, {{under the protection of}} their batteries, so as to attack the Americans in rear, and cut off their retreat. General Gage objected that it would place his troops between two armies; one at Cambridge, superior in numbers, the other on the heights, strongly fortified. He was for landing in front of the works, and pushing directly up the hill; a plan adopted through a confidence that raw militia would never stand their ground against the assault of veteran troops; another instance of undervaluing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>spirit,</b> which was to cost the enemy a lamentable loss of life.|$|E
