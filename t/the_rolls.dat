5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both zero-G rolls {{were removed from}} the ride. <b>The</b> <b>rolls</b> were a problem due to {{concerns}} of occasional stalling caused by a failure of the tower's LIMs. <b>The</b> <b>rolls</b> were replaced by a slightly banked inclined S-curve. Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open first before Batman. This was done because Robin was more reliable than Batman and the track replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E
5|$|Information {{about other}} {{subjects}} besides revenues also {{is contained in}} <b>the</b> <b>rolls,</b> including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons. The Pipe rolls also allow {{the identification of the}} custodians of royal lands and castles. The clerks writing <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.|$|E

30|$|In step 1, <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> {{moved slowly}} down and elastic–plastic {{deformation}} was produced to the saw blade. In step 2, <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> began to rotate and {{the rotation of}} <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> drove <b>the</b> saw blade to rotate. The vertical force acting on <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> calculated by <b>the</b> model was the rolling force.|$|R
5|$|The Keeper or Master of <b>the</b> <b>Rolls</b> and Records of the Chancery of England, {{known as}} the Master of <b>the</b> <b>Rolls,</b> {{is the second most}} senior judge in England and Wales after the Lord Chief Justice, and serves as President of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal and Head of Civil Justice. The {{position}} dates from at least 1286, although it is believed that the office probably existed earlier than that.|$|E
5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from <b>the</b> <b>rolls.</b> New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> were {{presented}} to the king they were archived in the royal collections. In 1680 Charles II gave two of <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> to Samuel Pepys, a navy administrator and avid book collector. Pepys did not disclose {{the details of how}} <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> were given to him, but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king's account of how he escaped from the Battle of Worcester (1651). The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677–89 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of William III and Mary II, which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time. After Pepys' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson. After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library, along with the codex, was then passed on to Pepys' old college at Magdalene, Cambridge, where it remains to this day.|$|E

5|$|The Anthony Roll is {{a record}} of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} consisted of three rolls of vellum, depicting 58naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. <b>The</b> <b>rolls</b> were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 Charles II gave two of <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of <b>the</b> <b>Rolls</b> in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of <b>the</b> <b>Rolls</b> and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E

Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the Labor Party candidate's 50.39%. Weaver contested the result, accusing the Labor Party of manipulating <b>the</b> <b>rolls.</b> An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the Labor Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of <b>the</b> <b>Rolls,</b> and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of <b>the</b> <b>Rolls,</b> Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E
