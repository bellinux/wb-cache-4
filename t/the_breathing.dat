5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>breathing</b> gas {{mixtures}} {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the time spent at each depth, <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> rate of the diver, the type of breathing apparatus to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E

5|$|Open circuit scuba systems {{discharge}} <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> {{gas into}} the environment as it is exhaled, and consist {{of one or more}} diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is usually achieved by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in <b>the</b> <b>breathing</b> gas, as substituting a different inert gas may have counter-diffusion complications due to differing rates of diffusion, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression.|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Within {{the mental}} health field, {{provider}} burnout is widespread and associated with far-reaching negative outcomes for providers, consumers, and organizations. Over the past four decades, various burnout interventions have been tested and found to be minimally effective, leading several researchers to suggest an increased focus on targeted recruitment (i. e., targeting providers {{who are most likely}} to benefit from a particular burnout intervention approach) and/or modifications to the interventions (e. g., format and content). Accordingly, the present study examined several person-related and intervention-related variables that were hypothesized to be predictive of response to BREATHE, a burnout intervention for mental health providers. Data from four prior studies that assessed the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> intervention were amalgamated. For the primary analyses, hierarchical linear regression was used to determine whether the person-related and/or intervention-related variables were predictive of treatment response. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> studies were examined to determine whether the intervention became less effective at reducing burnout with each subsequent iteration. With respect to person-related predictors of response to <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> intervention, age and turnover intentions were significant. Specifically, younger participants had higher post-intervention levels of depersonalization than older participants (β = -. 13, p =. 023), and higher baseline intentions to turnover were associated with greater post-intervention levels of emotional exhaustion (β =. 11 p =. 041) and depersonalization (β =. 12, p =. 023). In terms of intervention-related predictors of treatment response, participants who received <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> intervention in a multi-session format had higher post-treatment levels of emotional exhaustion than those who received <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> intervention in a single session format (β =. 13, p =. 015). Notably, across these primary analyses, baseline levels of burnout (i. e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) were consistently the strongest predictors of post-intervention levels of burnout. Lastly, the data suggests that <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> intervention became less effective with subsequent iterations. For example, earlier BREATHE studies had larger effect sizes than more recent studies. Additionally, there was a significant difference between the studies with respect to the change in emotional exhaustion (F(3, 230) = 4. 86, p =. 001, η 2 =. 06), such that participants in <b>the</b> first <b>BREATHE</b> study had a significantly larger reduction in emotional exhaustion than participants in the three subsequent studies. The present study was the first to examine potential predictors of response to <b>the</b> <b>BREATHE</b> intervention. Although <b>the</b> hypotheses were not supported, the implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research directions are provided...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Floor dust is {{commonly}} used for microbial determinations in epidemiological studies to estimate early-life indoor microbial exposures. Resuspension of floor dust {{and its impact on}} infant microbial exposure is, however, little explored. The aim of our study was to investigate how floor dust resuspension induced by an infant’s crawling motion and an adult walking affects infant inhalation exposure to microbes. Results We conducted controlled chamber experiments with a simplified mechanical crawling infant robot and an adult volunteer walking over carpeted flooring. We applied bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR to monitor <b>the</b> infant <b>breathing</b> zone microbial content and compared that to <b>the</b> adult <b>breathing</b> zone and <b>the</b> carpet dust as the source. During crawling, fungal and bacterial levels were, on average, 8 - to 21 -fold higher in <b>the</b> infant <b>breathing</b> zone compared to measurements from <b>the</b> adult <b>breathing</b> zone. During walking experiments, the increase in microbial levels in <b>the</b> infant <b>breathing</b> zone was far less pronounced. The correlation in rank orders of microbial levels in the carpet dust and <b>the</b> corresponding infant <b>breathing</b> zone sample varied between different microbial groups but was mostly moderate. The relative abundance of bacterial taxa was characteristically distinct in carpet dust and infant and adult <b>breathing</b> zones during <b>the</b> infant crawling experiments. Bacterial diversity in carpet dust and <b>the</b> infant <b>breathing</b> zone did not correlate significantly. Conclusions The microbiota in <b>the</b> infant <b>breathing</b> zone differ in absolute quantitative and compositional terms from that of <b>the</b> adult <b>breathing</b> zone and of floor dust. Crawling induces resuspension of floor dust from carpeted flooring, creating a concentrated and localized cloud of microbial content around the infant. Thus, the microbial exposure of infants following dust resuspension is difficult to predict based on common house dust or bulk air measurements. Improved approaches for the assessment of infant microbial exposure, such as sampling at <b>the</b> infant <b>breathing</b> zone level, are needed...|$|R

5|$|Most {{computers}} {{require the}} diver {{to specify the}} mixture before the dive, but some allow the choice of mixture to be changed during the dive, which allows {{for the use of}} gas switching for accelerated decompression.
