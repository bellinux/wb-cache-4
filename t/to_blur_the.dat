5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} relegated to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E

Some character animations may be ragdoll while others are preset; in developing the game, Krome tried <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> distinction between the two. The lighting system in the Wii version is more advanced than that in the PS2 version, which Krome also built; the PS2 includes more graphic details than their PSP version.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5000|$|However, Timothy Insoll (2004: 9) [...] {{has argued}} that these categorizations arise from a much-critiqued neo-evolutionary perspective. Strict dichotomies of {{religious}} forms may also contribute to skewing research toward state religions, leaving household religious practice, and the relationships between these, under-investigated (a trend noted by Elson and Smith, 2001 [...] ).

5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between the earlier and later pieces lies in a new conception of pulse. In the earlier works, the pulse {{is something to be}} divided into two, three and so on.

40|$|A new {{restoration}} algorithm for partial {{blurred image}} {{which is based}} on blur detection and classification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new blur detection algorithm is proposed <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions in <b>the</b> partial <b>blurred</b> image. Then, a new blur classification algorithm is proposed <b>to</b> classify <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions. Once <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> class of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernels of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed. Then, <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernel estimation methods are adopted <b>to</b> estimate <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> kernels. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions are restored using nonblind image deblurring algorithm and replace <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> regions in <b>the</b> partial <b>blurred</b> image with <b>the</b> restored regions. The simulated experiment shows that the proposed algorithm performs well...|$|R

For instance, Dudley-born comedian Lenny Henry, Walsall-born rock musician Noddy Holder, Smethwick-reared actress Julie Walters, Wollaston-born soap actress Jan Pearson, West Bromwich-born comedian Frank Skinner, are sometimes mistaken for Brummie-speakers by people outside the West Midlands county.|$|E
25|$|A Gaussian blur {{effect is}} {{typically}} generated by convolving an image with a kernel of Gaussian values. In practice, {{it is best}} {{to take advantage of the}} Gaussian blur’s separable property by dividing the process into two passes. In the first pass, a one-dimensional kernel is used <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> image in only the horizontal or vertical direction. In the second pass, the same one-dimensional kernel is used to blur in the remaining direction. The resulting effect is the same as convolving with a two-dimensional kernel in a single pass, but requires fewer calculations.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later six Nicaraguan cities rose in revolt. Armed youths took over the {{highland}} city of Matagalpa. Tercerista cadres attacked Guard posts in Managua, Masaya, León, Chinandega and Estelí. Large numbers of semi-armed civilians joined the revolt and put the Guard garrisons of the latter four cities under siege. The September Insurrection of 1978 was subdued {{at the cost of}} several thousand, mostly civilian, casualties. Members of all three factions fought in these uprisings, which began <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> divisions and prepare the way for unified action.|$|E

25|$|Fantasy is {{commonly}} associated with science fiction, {{and a number of}} writers have worked in both genres, while writers such as Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K.

The authors' professional organization is called the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics, and fantasy authors such as J.

25|$|The Church {{has long}} been {{concerned}} about the continued illegal practice of polygamy, and, in particular, about reports of child and wife abuse emanating from polygamous communities today. It will be regrettable if this program, by making polygamy the subject of entertainment, minimizes {{the seriousness of the}} problem. Placing the series in Salt Lake City, the international headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is enough <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> line between the modern Church and the program's subject matter, and to reinforce old and long-outdated stereotypes. Big Love, like so much other television programming, is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great minds.|$|E
25|$|According to this theory, in 1554, {{after the}} immolation of Michael de Villeneuve/Servetus, the editors and {{printers}} that {{had worked with}} him would have {{decided to make a}} new De Materia Medica as a tribute to their colleague and friend. All the commentaries that could identify Michel de Villeneuve as the author disappeared, but the rest are copied from his work of 1543. It is a very strange edition because there exist four different kinds of copies with different covers, one per editor: Jean Frellon, Guillaume Rouillé, Antoine Vicent and Balthazar Arnoullet, who was also the printer of this unique edition, in Lyons. For developing a bigger work and <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> mark of Michel de Villeneuve, they hired the expert on De Materia Medica, Pietro Andrea Mattioli.|$|E

Maciunas’ lifelong interest in diagrams made him chart the political, cultural and social history as well as art history and the chronology of Fluxus.|$|R

500|$|The {{works in}} this series are {{regarded}} as having [...] "dense abstract complexity" [...] <b>to</b> <b>blur</b> <b>the</b> clarity of his earlier references while emphasizing [...] "...the bravura of the brushstroke..." [...] rather than the subject that {{it is used to}} depict. [...] The use of the artist's paintbrush to create enormous renditions of house-painter brushstrokes in the quasi-mechanical Lichtenstein style is a commentary on his own painting actions. The series was a response to the Pop Art critics of the day, who were mostly abstract expressionist. He expropriated the most basic element of expressionism in his own style both in painting and in sculpture. The series of Brushstroke canvases is regarded as a group of works that parody [...] gestural painting by commenting on the normal individual relationship between the artist and his tools.|$|E
