5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

25|$|Hostettler signed <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> {{but he told}} an Evansville Courier & Press {{reporter}} the day {{he signed}} it he did not support two provisions: {{a balanced budget amendment}} and term limits. He was one of 40 Republicans in the House to vote in March 1995 against a constitutional amendment to set 12-year term limits for Representatives.|$|E
25|$|Allard {{served in}} the United States House of Representatives from Colorado's Fourth Congressional District from 1991 to 1997. As a Colorado Representative, Allard served on the Joint Committee on Congressional Reform, which {{recommended}} many of the reforms included in <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America.</b> These reforms became {{some of the first}} to be passed by the Republican controlled Congress in 1995 and were the key to their platform.|$|E

25|$|Gingrich {{generally}} favors policies {{intended to}} stimulate job growth through reductions in government regulations and federal taxes. In September 1994, Gingrich co-authored <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>With</b> <b>America,</b> {{which included the}} Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act. The act advocated for capital gains cuts and strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act. His 1995 book, To Renew America, outlined related ideas, including employer initiatives to make employees key players in improving processes and products.|$|E
25|$|During his {{freshman}} year, Boehner {{was a member}} of the Gang of Seven which was involved in bringing media attention to the House banking scandal. The group also investigated the Congressional Post Office, leading to the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski. Later, he, along with Newt Gingrich and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.|$|E
25|$|Newt Gingrich has {{declared}} {{his position on}} many political issues through his public comments and legislative record, including as Speaker of the House. The political initiative with which he is most widely identified was <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>With</b> <b>America,</b> which outlined an economic and social agenda designed to improve the efficiency of government while reducing its burden on the American taxpayer. Passage of the Contract helped establish Gingrich's reputation as a public intellectual. His engagement of public issues has continued through to the present, in particular as the founder of American Solutions for Winning the Future.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with various}} other {{conservative}} and libertarian organizations the Tea Party Patriots {{have developed a}} Contract from America that echoes <b>the</b> Republican <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> of 1994 stating some of the core principles and several specific goals shared by organizations and individuals involved with the tea parties.|$|R

50|$|With Swift {{retiring}} from the House in 1994, Metcalf ran yet again. This time, he was elected; he was re-elected in 1996 and 1998. A supporter of term limits such as those proposed in <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> (which Metcalf had signed), Metcalf did not run for re-election in 2000 in order to honor his self-imposed term-limit of three two-year terms.|$|R
25|$|As Congressman, Watts was {{assigned}} to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee. Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda, <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus. He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government. Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges. In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.|$|E
25|$|In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a {{platform}} that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman Newt Gingrich called <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a line-item veto, and welfare reform. After the elections gave the Republicans {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives, newly minted Speaker of the House Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the 1995–1996 government shutdown. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.|$|E
25|$|When Lloyd {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} in 1994, Wamp ran again. Battling through a hotly contested primary, he easily defeated his childhood friend and sitting State Representative Kenneth J. Meyer by nearly two to one. During the race, Wamp signed <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America.</b> He also personally committed to serve only six terms if elected and further committed to not accept special interest PAC money. He proposed a plan to pay congressmen the same as Lieutenant Colonels and linked his Democratic opponent, Randy Button, to Bill Clinton. Wamp won the general election with 52% of the vote, during the Republican Revolution. He likely got coattails from Bill Frist and Fred Thompsons strong 1994 statewide elections, and was helped in 1996 by Lloyd crossing party lines to endorse him. After his first two elections, he never faced another close contest, and was reelected seven times.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Simon opposed both <b>the</b> Republicans' <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> and President Bill Clinton's welfare reforms. He {{was one of}} 21 Senators to {{vote against}} the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In 1996, Simon joined {{thirteen}} other Senators (including his fellow U.S. Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley Braun) in voting against the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited federal recognition of same-sex marriage.|$|R
50|$|That {{same year}} the National Government also {{rescinded}} <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> signed <b>with</b> <b>América</b> Latina Logística (ALL), {{taking over the}} services previously granted to the company, such as Urquiza and San Martín freight services that had been managed by ALL until then. The Government alleged that ALL had not complied with the terms of <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> previously noted by the General Auditing Office of Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) is a United States {{federal law}} {{considered}} to be a major welfare reform. The bill was a cornerstone of <b>the</b> Republican <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> and was authored by Rep. E. Clay Shaw, Jr. (R-FL-22). President Bill Clinton signed PRWORA into law on August 22, 1996, fulfilling his 1992 campaign promise to [...] "end welfare as we have come to know it".|$|R
25|$|Coburn {{endorsed}} conservative {{activist and}} former diplomat Alan Keyes in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve {{no more than}} three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>With</b> <b>America</b> and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with its}} support of the welfare {{revisions}} in <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> the CWA advocated for other amendments, such as the reinstitution of state-sponsored school prayer and [...] "the eligibility of religious programs for public funding." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Congress, Pombo had a {{conservative}} track record. In 1994, during the Republican Revolution, {{he was one}} of the signatories of <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America.</b> He was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee. He was given the nickname [...] "The Marlboro Man" [...] by President George W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key aspect of <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> was <b>the</b> {{promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After {{the end of the}} government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|R
50|$|Norquist {{was listed}} {{as one of the}} five primary leaders of the post-Goldwater {{conservative}} movement by Nina Easton in her 2000 book, Gang of Five. Working with eventual Speaker Newt Gingrich, Norquist was one of the co-authors of <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> and helped to rally grassroots efforts, which Norquist later chronicled in his book Rock the House. Norquist also served as a campaign staff member on the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Republican Platform Committees.|$|R
25|$|In 1994, Republican Congressional {{candidates}} ran on {{a platform}} of major reforms of government with measures such as a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform. These measures and others formed <b>the</b> famous <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> which represented <b>the</b> first effort to have a party platform in an off-year election. <b>The</b> <b>Contract</b> promised to bring all points up for a vote {{for the first time in}} history. The Republicans passed some of their proposals, but failed on others such as term limits.|$|R
2500|$|The origin for {{the name}} [...] "first hundred hours" [...] is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action {{on the part of}} {{government}} (to combat the Great Depression) during his [...] "first hundred days" [...] in office. Newt Gingrich, who became Speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Morella {{came under}} greater {{pressure}} after her party {{took control of}} the House in 1994 Congressional elections. Although she signed <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> developed by Newt Gingrich, she had a mixed record supporting the subsequent Republican majority in Congress. She did not openly challenge the new House leadership until 1997 when she voted [...] "present" [...] for Speaker of the House instead of for the incumbent, Newt Gingrich. In 1998, she was one of four Republicans, along with Amo Houghton and Peter T. King of New York and Chris Shays of Connecticut, to oppose all four articles of impeachment against Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Second, Democrats {{have always}} {{elevated}} their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status. Republicans {{have not always}} followed this leadership succession pattern. In 1919, for instance, Republicans bypassed James R. Mann, R-IL, who had been minority leader for eight years, and elected Frederick Gillett, R-MA, to be Speaker. Mann [...] "had angered many Republicans by objecting to their private bills on the floor;" [...] also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-IL (1903–1911), and many Members [...] "suspected that {{he would try to}} re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker." [...] More recently, although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections, he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign, including <b>the</b> <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America</b> which was unveiled six weeks before voting day.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the fund's focus {{narrowed to}} {{assisting}} with tuition for family members, and <b>the</b> fund <b>contracted</b> <b>with</b> Scholarship <b>America</b> to manage tuition payments and reimbursements. The fund maintains an educational liaison to support families in their interactions <b>with</b> Scholarship <b>America</b> and <b>with</b> questions {{and concerns about}} educational matters.|$|R
2500|$|The 1994 federal midterm {{elections}} signaled a sea-change in American politics {{known as the}} Republican Revolution, with the Republican Party taking control of both houses of the U.S. Congress from Democrats. Key to that revolution was <b>the</b> Republicans' <b>Contract</b> <b>with</b> <b>America,</b> which included a list of actions they promised to take if they gained control of Congress. Among this list was the Line Item Veto Act itself, one of two provisions designed to ensure congressional fiscal conservatism. The Act was the only provision of the [...] "Contract with America" [...] that President Clinton supported.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{federal budget}} deficits and a rising public debt have been {{presented}} in terms that have produced mounting dissatisfaction with government. One solution offered {{to deal with this}} discontent has been a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget. In a working paper, Charles J.

In light of this conclusion, Whalen offers an alternative direction for federal budgetary policy. ...|$|R
