50|$|Amorphous phases are {{important}} constituents of thin films, which are solid layers {{of a few}} nanometres to some tens of micrometres thickness deposited upon a substrate. So-called structure zone models were developed to describe the micro structure and ceramics of thin films {{as a function of}} the homologous temperature <b>Th</b> <b>that</b> is the ratio of deposition temperature over melting temperature. According to these models, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the occurrence of amorphous phases is that Th has to be smaller than 0.3, that is the deposition temperature must be below 30% of the melting temperature. For higher values, the surface diffusion of deposited atomic species would allow for the formation of crystallites with long range atomic order.|$|E

50|$|Philippe Asplet (1818-1893) wrote {{under the}} name of Flip or L'Anmin Flippe. He was a Trinity man, {{although}} he was born in St. Martin and died in Grouville. His spelling shows the typical z instead of <b>th</b> <b>that</b> was typical of the now-disappeared Faldouet dialect. He was a Centenier and often wrote verses on parish elections. His work appeared in the satirical newspaper La Voix des Îles, frequently as captions to caricatures. He was a supporter of Victor Hugo and the French proscrits, and attacked the decision to force Hugo to leave Jersey. The Lieutenant-Governor tried to force Asplet to resign as Centenier because of his links with the proscrits, but L'Anmin Flippe refused and made public the correspondence. He spent a number of years in Paris and was clearly influenced by French poetry.|$|E
5000|$|Metals however, are not {{restricted}} to only phonon-based heat conduction. Thermal energy conducts through metals extraordinarily quickly because instead of direct molecule-to-molecule collisions, {{the vast majority of}} thermal energy is mediated via very light, mobile conduction electrons. This is why there is a near-perfect correlation between metals' thermal conductivity and their electrical conductivity. Conduction electrons imbue metals with their extraordinary conductivity because they are delocalized (i.e., not tied to a specific atom) and behave rather like a sort of quantum gas due to the effects of zero-point energy (for more on ZPE, see Note 1 below). Furthermore, electrons are relatively light with a rest mass only <b>th</b> <b>that</b> of a proton.

40|$|The single protein encoded by Abelson {{murine leukemia}} virus is a fusion of {{sequence}} from the retroviral gag genes with the v-abl sequence. Deletion {{of most of the}} gag region from the transforming protein results in a virus capable of transforming fibroblasts but no longer capable of transforming lymphoid cells. Smaller deletions in gag reveal that p 15 gag sequences are responsible for this effect, whereas deletion of p 12 sequences had no effect on lymphoid transformation. In transformed fibroblasts, p 15 -deleted and normal proteins had similar activities and subcellular localization. When the p 15 -deleted genome was introduced into previously transformed lymphoid lines, its protein product exhibited a marked instability. The tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation activity per cell was less than 1 / 20 <b>th</b> <b>that</b> of the nondeleted protein. Although pulse-Ia-beling showed that the p 15 -deleted protein was synthesized efficiently, immunoblotting demonstrated that its steady-state level was less than 1 / 10 <b>th</b> <b>that</b> of the nondeleted Abelson protein. The specific instability of the p 15 -deleted protein in lymphoid cells explains the requirement of these sequences for lymphoid but not fibroblast transformation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{replaced}} the glutamic acid- 165 at the active site of chicken triosephosphate isomerase with an aspartic acid residue using site-directed mutagenesis. Expression of the mutant protein in a strain of Escherichia coli that lacks the bacterial isomerase results in a complementation phenotype that is intermediate between strains that have no isomerase and strains that produce either the wild-type chicken enzyme or the native E. coli isomerase. The value of kcat for the purified mutant enzyme when glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate is the substrate is 1 / 1500 <b>th</b> <b>that</b> of the wild-type enzyme, and the Km is decreased {{by a factor of}} 3. 6. With dihydroxyacetone phosphate as substrate, the kcat value is 1 / 240 <b>th</b> <b>that</b> of the wild-type enzyme, and Km is 2 times higher. The value of Ki for a competitive inhibitor, phosphoglycolate, is the same for the mutant and wild-type enzymes, at 2 X 10 (- 5) M. By treating the enzyme-catalyzed isomerization as a simple three step process and assuming that substrate binding is diffusion limited, it is evident that the mutation of glutamic acid- 165 to aspartic acid principally affects the free energy of the transition state(s) for the catalytic reaction itself...|$|E
