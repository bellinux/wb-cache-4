40|$|Purpose: Published data {{indicate}} that the polar lipid content of human meibomian gland secretions (MGS) could be anything between 0. 5 % and 13 % of the total lipid. <b>The</b> <b>tear</b> film phospholipid composition has not been studied in great detail {{and it has been}} understood that the relative proportions of lipids in MGS would be maintained in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. <b>The</b> purpose of this work was to determine the concentration of phospholipids in <b>the</b> human <b>tear</b> film. Methods: Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) were used to determine the concentration of phospholipid in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. Additionally, an Amplex Red phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PLC) assay kit was used for determination of the activity of PLC in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. Results: Phospholipids were not detected in any of <b>the</b> tested human <b>tear</b> samples with <b>the</b> low limit of detection being 1. 3 µg/mL for TLC and 4 µg/mL for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. TLC indicated that diacylglycerol (DAG) may be present in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. PLC was in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film with an activity determined at approximately 15 mU/mL, equivalent to the removal of head groups from phosphatidylcholine at a rate of approximately 15 µM/min. Conclusions: This work shows that phospholipid was not detected in any of <b>the</b> tested human <b>tear</b> samples (above <b>the</b> lower limits of detection as described) and suggests the presence of DAG in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. DAG is known to be at low concentrations in MGS. These observations indicate that PLC {{may play a role in}} modulating <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film phospholipid concentration...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The study {{sought to}} {{determine}} dynamic changes and theoretical bases of a clinical diagnostic test, <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> clearance rate. METHODS [...] Thirty four healthy subjects {{ranging in age from}} 22 to 84 years underwent examination of <b>tear</b> clearance rate, <b>the</b> Schirmer test with anaesthesia, as well as fluorophotometric measurement of tear turnover, tear volume, and tear flow. By applying 0. 5 % fluorescein into the conjunctival sac and subsequently measuring colour fades on a Schirmer strip, <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> clearance rate for assessing tear drainage was divided into nine grades. The results of <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> clearance rate were compared with those of <b>the</b> basal <b>tear</b> turnover and tear flow obtained from fluorophotometry. RESULTS [...] Significant relations were found between <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> clearance rate and <b>the</b> basal <b>tear</b> turnover or tear flow (r = 0. 91 and 0. 79, respectively, p = 0. 0001). Considering the grades of progression from low to high, each grade of tear clearance rate showed a 12. 5 % increase in basal tear turnover (3. 59 %/min) and tear flow (0. 38 microliter/min). There was no significant correlation between age and <b>the</b> basal <b>tear</b> turnover, tear volume, <b>tear</b> flow, or <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> clearance rate.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tear</b> film is {{composed}} of three layers: the lipid, aqueous, and mucin. These {{play a role in}} creating a smooth surface to facilitate refraction, lubricating the movement of the eyelid, passively transporting gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and protecting the cornea. This last function is achieved through functions of various layers within <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. Tears bathe corneal epithelial cells in a moist environment, preventing them from drying out and weakening. However, the liquid layer of <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film also contains antimicrobial properties resulting from the presence of lysozymes, lactoferrins, lipocalin, and beta-lysine, which facilitate pathogen defenses such as lysis of bacterial cell walls, prevention of bacterial and viral binding, inflammation, and detoxification. Furthermore, white blood cells can be transported to the corneal surface via <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film, and both toxic agents as well as debris can be diluted and washed away by <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film. <b>The</b> <b>tear</b> film also contains immunoglobulins, especially IgA, which is found in concentrations significantly higher than in serum. IgA has been shown to prevent bacterial binding. Along with another immunoglobulin present in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film, IgG, IgA can also neutralize viruses and bind to bacteria, aiding in their detection via other pathways.|$|R
