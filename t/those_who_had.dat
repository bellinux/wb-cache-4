5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts.

Each of the censors reversed their positions: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> previously seen the breast now did not, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening {{with them on the}} set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
