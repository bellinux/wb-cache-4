25|$|On April 10, 1888, <b>the</b> Union <b>Elevated</b> opened <b>the</b> {{first piece}} of <b>the</b> Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> from Adams Street at City Hall east over Myrtle Avenue to Grand Avenue, where it junctioned with <b>the</b> Brooklyn <b>Elevated.</b> <b>The</b> company {{operated}} {{through to the end}} of <b>the</b> Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> at Van Siclen Avenue. Another branch operated by <b>the</b> Union <b>Elevated,</b> <b>the</b> Broadway <b>Elevated</b> from Gates Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, opened on June 25, 1888. This was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888. <b>The</b> Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated</b> was extended north over Adams Street to Sands Street at the Brooklyn Bridge on September 1, 1888, and <b>the</b> Union <b>Elevated</b> began running between Sands Street and Van Siclen Avenue. <b>The</b> Union <b>Elevated</b> opened <b>the</b> Hudson Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> a branch of <b>the</b> Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> from <b>the</b> intersection of Hudson and Park Avenues south to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal, on November 5, 1888, and began operating between Fulton Ferry and Flatbush Avenue.|$|R

5|$|Downtown Boston's streets grew organically, {{so they do}} {{not form}} a planned grid, unlike those in later-developed Back Bay, East Boston, the South End, and South Boston. Boston is the eastern {{terminus}} of I-90, which in Massachusetts runs along the Massachusetts Turnpike. <b>The</b> <b>elevated</b> portion of the Central Artery, which carried most of the through traffic in downtown Boston, was replaced with the O'Neill Tunnel during the Big Dig, substantially completed in early 2006.|$|E

Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether <b>the</b> <b>elevated</b> potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E

Based on an elevating equilibrator, a method for co-simulation is introduced with dynamic simulation software ADAMS and hydraulic simulation software EASY 5. A three-dimensional model of <b>the</b> <b>elevating</b> equilibrator is developed with Solidworks and is imported into ADAMS. Furthermore, the hydraulic system model is established by EASY 5. The interaction of mechanical system and hydraulic system is analyzed. The analysis indicates that the modeling method for co-simulation is effective and practical...|$|R

5|$|However, by 1973, NY27 {{had been}} cut back to its {{interchange}} with the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn while unsigned I-478 was assigned to both the Battery Tunnel {{and all of the}} West Side Elevated Highway south of the Lincoln Tunnel. NY9A was cut back to the Lincoln Tunnel as a result. The extension of I-478 into Manhattan was eliminated following the collapse of part of <b>the</b> <b>Elevated</b> Highway in 1973, an event which led to the demolition of the highway south of 59th Street. Demolition was completed in 1989. NY9A was shifted onto 12th Avenue, one of the surface streets that <b>the</b> <b>Elevated</b> Highway had run atop of, but was otherwise unaffected as the route's south end was initially kept at the Lincoln Tunnel.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the RTA (since re-branded as Sound Transit) began {{exploring}} alignment {{options for}} the Northgate segment, with residents voicing their opposition to at-grade or elevated alignments {{in favor of an}} underground route. Following several rounds of public hearings in 2000, the Sound Transit Board narrowed down the routing options to a tunnel under 12th Avenue and an elevated alignment along Interstate 5 to the west of Roosevelt's commercial district, each with a station at Northeast 65th Street. Further discussion on the two remaining choices in 2004 led to divides in the Sound Transit Board; community and business groups in Roosevelt favored an underground alignment, while Seattle mayor Greg Nickels supported <b>the</b> <b>elevated</b> station, which was less costly and closer to the Green Lake neighborhood. On January 28, 2005, the Sound Transit Board unanimously approved an underground alignment with a station along 12th Avenue NE between NE 65th and 67th streets, citing a smaller-than-expected difference in cost compared to <b>the</b> <b>elevated</b> option.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Union <b>Elevated</b> Railroad Company, leased by <b>the</b> Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> Railroad, built <b>the</b> Hudson Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> {{a branch}} of the Brooklyn Elevated's Lexington Avenue Elevated.
