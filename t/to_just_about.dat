25|$|The {{design is}} easily {{confused}} with Phase IV designs, {{although there are}} several differences between Phase IV and Phase VI. The Phase VI stripes are {{the same size and}} arrangement as Phase IV, however the blue is lighter, not a purple-like color, and is the same blue used for Phase V. The current Amtrak Travelmark logo is displayed in white or blue depending on where it is located on the car. The car number and car type lettering are much smaller than on previous paint schemes with Frutiger replacing the previous Helvetica typeface. On the skirt of the car, there is usually a red reflective stripe, the same as on Phase V. Although not used on any locomotives, Phase VI has been applied <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every type of Amtrak passenger car used today, including Superliner, Amfleet, Horizon, and the remaining Heritage equipment (though a small number of cars remain in older paint schemes in rail yards and at railroad museums). Phase VI has not been applied on any of Amtrak's locomotives as it was designed to correspond with Phase V locomotives.|$|E

500|$|Spider-Man 2 {{opened in}} US theaters on June 30, 2004. This entry focuses on Peter Parker's struggles, {{as he tries}} to manage both his {{personal}} life and his duties as Spider-Man. He also has to stop the film's main villain, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), a man who becomes insane after an experiment of his goes haywire. Spider-Man 2 [...] was less successful in its first week of release, taking first place at the box office with around $88 million at 4,152 locations. Nonetheless, the sequel set several box office records at the time and broke the record for best opening day title ever, previously held by the preceding Spider-Man film. It eventually made more than $783 million worldwide but still stands as the lowest-grossing in the trilogy. However, it also stands as the best received film in the franchise. Movie critics believed the second installment had better humor and action sequences than its predecessor and that it was [...] "unusually good" [...] for its genre. A writer for website IGN said this film had [...] "a better flowing storyline, more emotional depth, and a less ridiculous looking supervillain, Spider-Man 2 elevated the series <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> everything that comic fans love about the character." [...] The website also ranked Spider-Man 2 as being the third best superhero film of all-time on their 2005 list. Time magazine also named the sequel the third best superhero movie on their top-ten list published in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Lucy Mangan of The Guardian responded positively, noting it [...] "manages brilliantly to nod <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every Whovian in-joke, {{demographic}} and fetish within {{the span of}} two tiny installments". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn opined that the two Amys in [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were [...] "a lot more fun to watch" [...] than the two in the sixth series episode [...] "The Girl Who Waited". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino, who had positive towards Amy's character in the past, was disappointed that {{the ending of the}} miniepisodes relied on [...] "too-easy, dated, sexist humor". She cited the fact that Rory dropping the coupling was blamed on Amy's short skirt rather than Rory himself, which implied that she had a [...] "responsibility to cover up, because 'men will be men'". In Who is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith wrote that the episode was [...] "cute, plotted to perfection and ends precisely when it should, before it has the chance to outstay its welcome". He said that the episodes used Amy well, as it did not make her unlikable. On the other hand, his coauthor Graeme Burk said that the story was [...] "derivative and lazy" [...] and a [...] "missed opportunity". He likened the plot to that of Red Dwarf [...] "Future Echoes", and felt that Moffat could have written something better and funnier. Like Jusino, he thought that the [...] "blokey humor" [...] was [...] "misplaced", denying a broad audience appeal and leading to the sexist last line: [...] "Pond, put some trousers on!". Despite this, both Jusino and Burk enjoyed the scene where Amy flirts with herself.|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century {{did bring}} about a renewed {{commitment}} to quality production and ushered in technological advances that would allow viticulture to be more profitable and reliable in this cool northern climate. In 1938, the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine created the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) region for Chablis that mandated the grape variety (Chardonnay) and acceptable winemaking and viticultural practices within delineated boundaries.

With over [...] under irrigation along the river by 1900 – this figure has only grown hugely since then – the river and its tributaries became much narrower, siltier and shallower, with large consequences for the natural environment, for sustainability of water supplies in its valley, and also huge changes for water politics in the state. The San Joaquin and its tributaries seemed to give rise <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> every single possible argument over water, including such cases as [...] "When is a river not a river?"

2500|$|After sending art samples, McLoughlin found {{stories to}} {{illustrate}} for the Scottish publishing firm D.C. Thomson and Co., Ltd., in 1974. He {{has been working}} for them ever since and contributed <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> all of their adventure titles (all of which are now defunct) including Wizard, Victor, Buddy, Crunch, Bullet, and Scoop. Primarily, however, McLoughlin's work appeared in Wizard. At his height with the company (22 October 1977), five McLoughlin stories graced the pages of two Thomson titles, Wizard and Bullet. Perhaps the best regarded of McLoughlin's strips for Thomson were [...] "Sign of the Shark" [...] featuring x-agent Jake Jeffords, [...] "The Green Lizard" [...] which was a science fiction tale, and [...] "The Shark" [...] featuring the crew of a German E-Boat during World War II. Unfortunately, {{the days of the}} traditional British comic story paper were already numbered by the late-1970s and by 1983, most ceased publication. Denis drew two western features for the 1983 Look and Learn Annual before beginning his monthly stint for Thomson's Commando, a 64-page war comic digest which sees four issues released twice a month (96 issues a year). McLoughlin produced about one issue of Commando a month until his death on 22 April 2002.|$|E
