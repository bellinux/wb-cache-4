Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>in</b> particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E

25|$|With the {{adoption}} of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where {{the focus is on}} minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up until <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>In</b> his Ospățul lui Pentaur ("The Feast of Pentaur"), the poet reflected on civilization itself, as reflected in inanimate opulence. The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in Cartea de aur, collectively titled nuvele fără oameni ("novellas without people") and compared by Călinescu with the paintings of Theodor Aman.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 1880, Vizcarrondo and Rafael María de Labra {{became the}} founders of the Sociedad Nacional Democrática (National Democratic Society), a {{political}} party whose main goal was to ask for more autonomy for both Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1886, he was elected as the representative for his party of the district of Ponce, Puerto Rico. In the Spanish Parliament, Vizcarrondo recommended an autonomy modeled after the type that Canada had at <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>In</b> 1887, he participated in a massive campaign directed against the Spanish appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Romualdo Palacios, which resulted in the governor's replacement. Julio Vizcarrondo Coronado died in 1889, in Madrid.|$|E
25|$|By <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> time, he was {{publicly}} voicing {{his concern}} that Transylvania was {{a target of}} expansion for Regency-period Hungary, while cautioning the public against Nazi Germany and its revanchism. Similarly, {{he was concerned about}} the Soviet threat and the fate of Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the Transnistrian anti-communist refugee Nichita Smochină. Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of Bucharest Radio broadcasts, Sfaturi pe întuneric ("Advice at Dark", soon after published in brochure format). He completed several new volumes, among which were Dovezi despre conștiința originii românilor ("Evidence on the Conscious Origin of the Romanians"), the polemical essay Lupta mea contra prostiei ("My Fight against Stupidity"), and the first two volumes of the long planned Istoria românilor.|$|E

25|$|By <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> history, Carol had {{established}} his National Renaissance Front dictatorship, and, in 1940, appointed Ion Gigurtu {{to lead a}} government that included some Iron Guard members. Gomoiu also joined, serving as Gigurtu's Health Minister from July 4 to September 4. In this capacity, and also {{as a member of}} the Crown Council, he was marginally involved in the major international crisis which saw the cession of Romanian land to the Soviet Union and the Axis Powers. On the night of August 29–30, he was among a majority of ministers who voted to peacefully cede the regions of Northern Transylvania to Regency Hungary. Gomoiu kept his ministerial office during the first government of Ion Antonescu, from September 4 to 14, until the establishment of the National Legionary State and Carol's flight from the country. Reportedly, he resented Antonescu's alliance with the Iron Guard, and avoided politics altogether.|$|E
25|$|The unorthodox play of Higgins was {{encapsulated}} in his {{break of}} 69, made under unusual pressure, against Jimmy White in the penultimate frame of their World Professional Snooker Championship semi-final in 1982. Higgins was 0–59 {{down in that}} frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball pot on a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, {{not only for its}} extreme degree of difficulty but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>In</b> potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went a little too far for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.|$|E
500|$|The {{competition}} between 50 Cent and West, {{when the two}} released their studio albums on the same day, was penultimate {{in a series of}} articles that lists fifty key events in the history of R and hip-hop music, written by Rosie Swash of The Guardian. Swash wrote that it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] Similarly, according to DJBooth, while Graduation is far from being West's best studio album, it nevertheless is a pretty good piece of work while the outcome of its competition with 50 Cent stands as a historical moment in hip-hop culture: [...] "Graduation isn’t Kanye's best, it's very few people's favorite, but it’s still an okay body of work. He’s literally transitioning into stardom right before our very eyes and attempting to embody <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> time. Kanye's victory over 50 is the bookmark for when rap changed, it was no longer ran by the gangsters, the doors opened for Drake, Kid Cudi and J. Cole. Graduation is a monument, a hip-hop treasure, a Kanye classic." ...|$|E

Tintin has, however, chosen the hour of their death to {{coincide}} with a solar eclipse, and with a little play-acting, the terrified Incas believe that Tintin can command the Sun. The Inca prince implores Tintin to make the Sun show its light again. At Tintin's command, the Sun returns, and the three are quickly set free. Afterwards, the Prince of the Sun tells them that the seven crystal balls used on the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members, who had excavated Rascar Capac's tomb, contained a [...] "mystic liquid" [...] obtained from coca that plunged them into a deep sleep. Each time the Inca high priest cast his spell over seven wax figures of the explorers, he could use them as he willed as punishment for their sacrilege. Tintin convinces the Inca prince that the explorers wished only to make known to the world the splendours of their civilisation. The Inca prince orders Chiquito to destroy the wax figures, and at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> Europe the seven explorers awaken. After swearing an oath to keep the temple's existence a secret, Tintin, Haddock and Calculus head home, while Zorrino remains with the Inca, having accepted an offer to live among them.|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{appearance}} in Batman: Arkham Origins included a speech {{delivered at the}} conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the opportunity to observe Anarky after he has been defeated, and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the Caped Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of PopMatters, in comparing the game to its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City, asserted that the narrative of Origins consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas City uncritically took his motivations as a given. [...] "Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism," [...] writes Dinicola, choosing <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> the game as one of several examples of this theme. [...] "Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society." [...] Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way City could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane {{announced}} that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer Kara Vallow confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. A month after the announcement, Kevin Reilly, President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: [...] "Of all the issues, [...] {{is the one that}} seems to be the most of a hot button. Particularly at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> time, the economy was really struggling and there were a lot of very tough conversations going on with clients." [...] Reilly said that [...] "the advertisers know what they’re getting" [...] with Family Guy, and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but [...] "this one felt like it could cause trouble, and it was just not worth it." [...] Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on BBC Three in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station. Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Fox stated that there were no plans to air it on their network. Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Family Guy was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since The Flintstones in 1961. Commenting about the event, MacFarlane said, [...] "We did this to drum up Emmy votes, so we could lose by fewer votes." ...|$|E
