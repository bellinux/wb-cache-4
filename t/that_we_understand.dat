25|$|Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP {{claim that}} it is neither {{testable}} nor falsifiable, and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes {{as a function of}} the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.|$|E
2500|$|Quentin Letts of The Daily Mail {{gave the}} show a {{negative}} review, stating that it [...] "is as slow to motor as a lawnmower at spring's first cut". He also criticised {{the show for}} lacking in storytelling and romance, stating that it [...] "assumes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the attraction these two dullards [...] have for the beautiful Christine. Could she do no better? ... In the end you conclude that she simply seeks out suffering to improve her art." [...] Letts praised the performances and the orchestration but concluded that the show was not a hit: [...] "But {{if it is a}} miss, it is ... a noble miss, noble because Lloyd Webber’s increasingly operatic music tries to lift us to a higher plane." [...] Susannah Clapp of The Observer was also critical of the book and called the show [...] "drab" [...] and [...] "about as tension-filled as winding wool." [...] Even the musical numbers, she wrote, [...] "never meld with the visual splendours, never give the effect, which is Lloyd Webber's gift, of the music delivering the scenery." [...] Sam Marlowe of Time Out London gave the show one out of five stars, calling it [...] "ghastly" [...] and [...] "an interminable musical monstrosity". He observes: [...] "With its sickening swirls of video imagery, pointless plot, and protracted, repetitive songs, Love Never Dies ... is punishingly wearisome." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will not}} forget, sir," [...] said Bluewater, [...] "any {{part of my}} commission; but inform the {{commander-in-chief}} of the whole. It may be important <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> each other fully. You will also hand him this letter which I have hastily written while the boat was getting ready." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{person with}} a turn for logic might argue that if God is the Father of all men, and {{if the child is}} father to the man, it follows that the true {{representative}} of God at the christening is the child itself. But such posers are unpopular, because they imply that our little customs, or, as we often call them, our religion, mean something, or must originally have meant something, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> and believe that something.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to such criticisms, Bailey reiterated a line from his book: [...] "True acceptance of the transgendered requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> truly <b>understand</b> who they are." ...|$|R

[...] "First of all, my dear, let us know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> each other. This dear girl--to me she is inexpressibly dear--is to be your wife." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{white people}} think that we know everything. For instance, we think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> human nature. And so we do, as human nature appears to us, with all its trappings and {{accessories}} seen dimly through the glass of our conventions, leaving out those aspects of it which we have forgotten or {{do not think it}} polite to mention. But I, Allan Quatermain, reflecting upon these matters in my ignorant and uneducated fashion, have always held that no one really understands human nature who has not studied it in the rough. Well, that is the aspect of it with which I have been best acquainted.|$|E

"We {{have just}} come through a great struggle, {{in which our}} women have borne an heroic part,--have shown {{themselves}} capable {{of any kind of}} endurance and self-sacrifice; and now we are in that reconstructive state which makes it of the greatest consequence to ourselves and the world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> our own institutions and position, and learn that, instead of following the corrupt and worn-out ways of the Old World, we are called on to set the example of a new state of society,--noble, simple, pure, and religious; and women can do more towards this even than men, for women are the real architects of society.|$|E
30|$|We {{analyzed}} the data quantitatively and qualitatively. The demographic and descriptive data was charted and analyzed {{in order to}} ensure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understood</b> what the participants did during the experiment. The interview transcripts were analysed using the Grounded Theory approach ([52], p. 101) to elicit themes in the answers. We worked first through the transcripts of the interviews line by line, coding the data. This process was repeated to ensure that all codes had been identified. The codes were then grouped into themes.|$|R

6000|$|... "My friend," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "it {{is not for}} you to {{talk like}} that, to-night of all nights. If I say little, it is because we are both men of few words, and I think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand.</b> You know very well what you and your shock-headed friend have done for me. Not that I believe," [...] he went on, [...] "that it would ever come {{to me to be}} hounded to death by such a gang. I am too fervent a believer in my own star for that. But one never knows. It is well, anyhow, to escape with a sound skin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] he said, [...] "we {{will not}} bandy words any longer. It is better <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>{{understand}}</b> one another.

If you will permit us to come in and find him, I promise that nothing shall happen in your room, that you shall not be compromised in any way. If you refuse, I must warn you that you will become involved in a matter more serious than you have any idea of." ...|$|E
6000|$|Six {{months later}} {{there was a}} {{paragraph}} in the San Francisco press: [...] "The wonderful Arsenical Spring in the Santa Cruz Mountain, known as 'Liberty Spring,' discovered by Doctor Ruysdael, has proved such a remarkable success <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> the temporary huts for patients are to be shortly replaced by a magnificent Spa Hotel worthy of the spot, and the eligible villa sites it has brought into the market. It will {{be a source of}} pleasure to all to know that the beautiful nymph--a worthy successor to the far-famed 'Elise' of the German 'Brunnen'--who has administered the waters to so many grateful patients will still be in attendance, although it is rumored that she is shortly to become the wife of the distinguished discoverer." ...|$|E
