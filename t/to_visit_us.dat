25|$|On 19 June 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and his New Zealand {{counterpart}} Minister of Defence Jonathan Coleman {{signed the}} Washington Declaration which committed the US and New Zealand to a closer defense cooperation arrangement. It sought to restore defense {{cooperation between the}} two countries which had been curtailed by the ANZUS Split. Two key areas of this Declaration included the resumption of regular senior-level dialogues between the US Department of Defense and the New Zealand Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force; and security cooperation. As a result of the Washington Declaration, New Zealand warships were allowed <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>US</b> ports even though New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy remained intact. The Washington Declaration was also part of the Obama administration's pivot into the Asia-Pacific to counter the emerging influence of China.|$|E

2500|$|Cardinal Francis Spellman, in {{the region}} <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops, came to Vietnam in early January, celebrated masses, and gave a {{donation}} to Catholic Relief Services. [...] While various reports suggested Spellman was Diệm's patron in the U.S., {{it seems likely that}} his visit was one for his coreligionists. Obviously, Spellman would not be unhappy with a Catholic leader, but the U.S. was quite aware that Diệm's Catholicism isolated him from the majority of South Vietnamese. When an Australian cardinal visited Vietnam shortly afterwards, J. Lawton Collins suggested to Diệm's brother, the Bishop of Huế, that there be a moratorium on high-level Catholic visits. Collins suggested that these visits aggravated the isolation of Diệm from the majority.|$|E
2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> <b>us,</b> lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me more than I can tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E
