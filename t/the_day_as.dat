5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>As</b> a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>as</b> they do in nature when grazing on pasture. Although {{this is not always}} possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E

5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front. The front remained over the same areas during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>as</b> daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and unstable air northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E

5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>as</b> strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} {{appearing}} against England in a warm-up match in Moscow for the 1958 World Cup, Streltsov {{was invited to}} a party by a Soviet military officer, Eduard Karakhanov, to be held on 25 May. Streltsov {{and the rest of}} the Soviet squad were on a pre-World Cup training camp at Tarasovka, just outside Moscow, but the team had been given <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> holiday. At the end of such days, the players had to report to the authorities at Dynamo Stadium at 4:30pm, but Streltsov and two team-mates, Spartak players Mikhail Ogonkov and Boris Tatushin, ignored this rule and went to the party anyway. Held at Karakhanov's dacha, it was also attended by a 20-year-old woman named Marina Lebedeva, whom Streltsov had never met. The following morning, Streltsov, Ogonkov and Tatushin were all arrested and charged with raping her.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> crews continued to plow and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E

5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|By August9, {{increasing}} {{wind shear}} further weakened the storm, with Felicia being downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} early that day. The storm rapidly weakened throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear. By the late morning hours, little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of Felicia. A weak cyclone, the storm continued to track towards Hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center. The system slowly weakened before being downgraded to a tropical depression on August11 as no areas of tropical storm-force winds were found by Hurricane Hunters. Several hours after being downgraded, the CPHC issued its final advisory on Felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the Hawaiian Islands. The system dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{fight against}} cancer, {{spending}} {{most of the last}} year of his life in and out of hospital, Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in Tapion Hospital, Castries, aged 69. The body lay in state on 5 October, where it was viewed by Pearlette Louisy, Kenny Anthony, and members of the Cabinet. Odlum's funeral was held on 6 October, with a 30-vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin, draped in the national flag. St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum's death. The funeral itself was held in a park, due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners. During the service, sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers. James Fletcher, a Cabinet Secretary, had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half-mast for <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> a tribute.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fran, also {{referred}} initially as Subtropical Storm Bravo, was a long-tracked Category 1 hurricane that caused little damage during its existence in early October 1973. Originating from a tropical wave that developed {{off the coast}} of Hispaniola on October1, the precursor to Fran slowly developing {{during the first week of}} October. By October4, a surface low formed within the system and convective activity increased. The system was eventually classified as a subtropical depression on October8 and was upgraded to Subtropical Storm Bravo shortly thereafter. Bravo became increasingly tropical throughout <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> it intensified. Following a reconnaissance mission into the storm on October10, it was deemed fully tropical and upgraded to a hurricane, at which time it was renamed Fran.|$|E

5|$|Miller had a quiet match. He did not bowl in {{the first}} innings as England batted first and posted 363. The closest {{he came to a}} catch was when Yardley edged to him in slips on the half-volley. When Australia batted, he came to the crease and joined Morris with the score at 3/82 and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps on the second day. He was on 23 and Morris had made 48. The run rate picked up in the last 50 minutes of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time. The next day, Australia {{struggled}} against the new ball {{in the first}} hour. Miller was beaten three times in one Bedser over before Dick Pollard trapped him for 31, prompting a middle-order collapse of 3/37, before the tourists recovered to end at 221, avoiding the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
