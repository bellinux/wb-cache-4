In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, [...] "Here's the deal: {{my father was}} born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if {{it comes down to}} a derby match or an FA Cup final between the <b>two,</b> <b>I</b> would have to support Everton.

500|$|Later in June, Feige {{stated the}} film was still {{intended}} to be released on the July 17, 2015 date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014.

500|$|Nick Offerman {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} his performance as Ron Swanson {{during the second}} season. Many reviewers praised Offerman's subtle and understated style of comedy, {{and said he was}} often the funniest part of the scenes he was in. Jonah Weiner of Slate magazine declared Swanson [...] "Parks and Recreations secret weapon" [...] and [...] "vital to the show's improvement". Aziz Ansari, who was particularly acclaimed during the first season for his role as Tom Haverford, received similar praise in the second season as well. Many reviewers were critical of the pairing of Mark and Ann, feeling the couple lacked chemistry and were often the least funny parts of the individual episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons called Mark and Ann the show's [...] "Achilles' heel", and Sandra Gonzalez, also from Entertainment Weekly, wrote, [...] "No matter what they do with these <b>two,</b> <b>I</b> can’t help but be bored." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part <b>two,</b> <b>I</b> was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E
500|$|Danny Peary {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about A View to a Kill but was generally complimentary: [...] "Despite what reviewers automatically reported, [...] looks trimmer and more energetic than {{in some of the}} previous efforts... I wish Bond had a few more of his famous gadgets on hand, but his actions scenes are exciting and some of the stunt work is spectacular. Walken's the first Bond villain who is not so much an evil person as a crazed neurotic. I find him more memorable than some of the more recent Bond foes... Unfortunately, the filmmakers – who ruined villain Jaws by making him a nice guy in Moonraker – make the mistake of switching May Day at the end from Bond's nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the <b>two</b> (<b>I</b> suppose gentleman Bond isn't allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day)... lacks the flamboyance of earlier Bond films, and has a terrible slapstick chase sequence in San Francisco, but overall it's fast-paced, fairly enjoyable, and a worthy entry in the series.".|$|E
500|$|During {{practice}} for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond set the fastest unofficial practice speed of the month, besting even race favorite Johnny Rutherford in the vaunted Chaparral.

He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. [...] "I busted up a few Indy cars right after that," [...] he said. [...] "Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio... at Michigan I cut one in <b>two.</b> <b>I</b> was afraid my racing career would come to a halt.

500|$|In 1954, Thatcher was {{defeated}} when she sought selection {{to be the}} Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years stating: [...] "I really just felt the twins were... only <b>two,</b> <b>I</b> really {{felt that it was}} too soon. I couldn't do that." [...] Afterwards, Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, Thatcher's maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill (the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960), requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; the bill was successful and became law. In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.|$|E
500|$|Also {{in early}} 1996, Nu Millennia Media {{released}} Self Portrait, which included five of Walker's songs in an interactive CD-ROM format and 30 minutes of video footage. He then released his fourth album, 1997's Rumor Has It, which he co-produced with Stroud. Its title track, the first single, became his sixth and final No. 1 single that year. Other singles from the album included the number 18 [...] "One, <b>Two,</b> <b>I</b> Love You" [...] and the Top 5 hits [...] "Watch This" [...] and [...] "Then What?" [...] at number 4 and number 2, respectively. The latter also reached number 65 on the Hot 100, making {{for his first}} entry on that chart since [...] "What's It to You." [...] As with his three previous studio albums, Rumor Has It was certified platinum. Larry Stephens of Country Standard Time gave this album a mostly-negative review, calling the songs [...] "cookie-cutter" [...] outside [...] "I Need a Margarita". Thom Owens of Allmusic also {{thought that it was}} formulaic, but said that Walker was [...] "able to make even mediocre material sound good", rating it three stars out of five.|$|E

[...] We're still doing it. … [...] The next one is more like trap music. It’s Trap Muzik 2017. And the one after that, it’s gonna be more like a, uh, love as it pertains to a dope boy. And the one after that, that’s my final album. It’s called Kill the King. The last album is Kill the King. Simply because ever since my first album, I've put the title of 'King of the South' on me and to make yourself the king is to make you a target. And in chess, the object is to kill the king. So Kill the King is the title of my last album. Will they kill him or will he ride into the sunset happily ever after?" ...|$|E
