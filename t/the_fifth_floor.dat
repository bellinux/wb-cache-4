5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project headquarters on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, {{who was in charge}} of the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district did not change.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, Monsanto rented {{three floors}} of a {{warehouse}} at 601 East Third Street from General Electric. Initially {{it was used}} to receive and store equipment used by the Project. Later the fourth floor was used as office space, and a laboratory was established on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> where studies were carried out on the effects of polonium on laboratory animals. Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of polonium contamination of the samples.|$|E
50|$|The upper stories feature banded stonework, paired {{fenestration}} {{from the}} second through <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floors,</b> and projecting, multi-story piers from the third through <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floors</b> on molded bases and carved caps with egg-and-dart moldings. Paneled spandrels separate the third-through the fifth-floor fenestration, which contains one-over-one wood or steel sash. The sixth story displays pairs of round-arched windows with voussoirs that spring from molded bands and projecting keystones. The one-over-one sash appears {{to be made of}} wood.|$|R

5|$|The tower has two outdoor {{terraces}} {{as part of}} Trump's {{agreement with}} the city during construction. There is a terrace on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> on the northern (57th Street) side of the building, with a smaller fourth-floor terrace on the southern (56th Street) side. The fifth-floor north-side terrace has several trees and a fountain, while the fourth-floor south-side terrace has {{little more than a}} few granite benches. There is also a passageway to a glass-roofed POPS at 590 Madison Avenue.|$|E
5|$|At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was {{the first}} Chinese hotel to have a lift. The {{original}} design accommodated offices on the first storey, the hotel on {{the second and third}} storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. The whole of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> was occupied by a then-well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for nuclear}} power {{and nuclear weapons}} was {{transferred}} from the Manhattan District to the United States Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal issued a joint directive creating the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> of the Pentagon. Groves had already made a start on the new mission by creating Sandia Base in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The new library {{opened in}} December 2014 {{and has become}} a highly popular {{gathering}} place. In addition to a book collection significantly larger than that of the former library, the new building houses a wide range of amenities including cafés, an auditorium, and community rooms. The striking architecture is characterised by <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor's</b> cantilever over <b>the</b> entrance plaza, a central atrium criss-crossed by staircases, and the building's transparency and relationship to the urban context.|$|R

5|$|Shooting {{took place}} almost entirely in London. The {{directors}} somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri, {{the director of}} the first two episodes of series one and two, who used London and the River Thames as characters in themselves. The exterior and interior of Freemasons' Hall continued to be a stand-in for Thames House, the headquarters of MI5. However, the Grid, the base of operations of Section D, was a set constructed at <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> in another building. Danny's apartment was also filmed in the same building. Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans, which was housed near the Grid set.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals and sell the others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National Carousel Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities, these rooms where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor. These fitting are also in the former board room, which is located in a 'commanding' position on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor,</b> overlooking the river below.|$|E
50|$|In 1913-1914, the Boston Athenæum {{employed}} the architectural firm of Bigelow and Wadsworth {{to expand the}} building. <b>The</b> fourth and <b>fifth</b> <b>floors</b> were set back {{so as not to}} disrupt the symmetry of the façade. This renovation fireproofed the building and expanded the space, including addition of <b>the</b> beautiful <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> reading room and the fourth floor Trustees’ Room. At the same time, much-needed shelving was installed {{in the form of a}} drum stack—that is, a ten story Snead stack occupying a semi-circular space from the basement to the third floor.|$|R

5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor,</b> he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

5000|$|There is one mysterious {{room in the}} tower, {{the purpose}} of which is still being debated. Archaeologists dubbed it the [...] "acoustic room".

5000|$|Safronov {{fell out}} of the {{staircase}} window between the fourth and <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floors</b> of his apartment building at 9 Nizhny Novgorod Street (Нижегородская улица) around 4 p.m. on 2 March. Two university students living in a nearby building saw Safronov on the ground with the window open above, and called emergency workers. Safronov was alive immediately after the fall, but at least a half-hour passed before help arrived. Safronov was lying on his stomach, and it seemed to the students that he had tried to get up on his feet. Noticing the open window on the stairway between <b>the</b> fourth and <b>fifth</b> <b>floors</b> and <b>the</b> fact that the Safronov's shoes had come off and his jacket and sweater were pulled up to his armpits, the students called for an ambulance. Their call was not accepted, however. [...] "We cannot collect all the drunks in Moscow on Friday night," [...] the first responders told psychology student Lena, who had witnessed the fall. She should call back if he was still there in half an hour, Kommersant reported on 6 March 2007.http://www.kommersant.com/p747802/Ivan_Safronov_arms_trading/ During that time Safronov stopped moving altogether. The students told the daily that they did not see anyone near Safronov, nor anyone in the windows of the stairway or leaving through the front door. At least three of his neighbors on <b>the</b> fourth and <b>fifth</b> <b>floors</b> were home at the time. They did not hear any suspicious noises on the stairway.|$|R
25|$|Plans {{were made}} for, among others, a Stentor division, {{a section of}} {{high-pressure}} diapasons and reeds. It was to be installed on <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor,</b> above the String Division, and would be playable from the sixth manual. However, it was never funded, and the sixth manual is now used to couple other divisions or play various solo voices from other divisions that are duplexed to this keyboard.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} at 7:55a.m. the steam was gone. Because the {{radiation}} levels were too high all work to remove rubble was done by remote control. Operations stopped after the steam was found. According to TEPCO the rain on 17 and 18 July was to blame. On 18 July the actual dosage measurement was 562 millisieverts per hour, therefore the NRA ordered TEPCO to make further investigations. On 23 July at 9:05 the steam was seen again coming out of <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> just above the reactor containment. The night before a rain shower did hit the building, and water might have reached the - 38C - reactor container lid, or might have reached hot fuel {{left behind in the}} reactor vessel. At that moment the ambient temperature was 20.3 C and the humidity was 91.2 percent. All work removing rubble from the place was halted. During the last event, radiation levels were measured at 24 locations around <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> of the reactor building. The dosage ranged between 137 millisieverts and 2,170 millisieverts per hour.|$|E
