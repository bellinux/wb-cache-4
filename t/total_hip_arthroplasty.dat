2500|$|Sciatic nerve injury occurs between 0.5% and 2.0% of {{the time}} during <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasty.</b> [...] Sciatic nerve palsy is a {{complication}} of <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasty</b> with an incidence of 0.2% to 2.8% {{of the time}}, or with an incidence of 1.7% to 7.6% following revision. Following the procedure, in rare cases, a screw, broken piece of trochanteric wire, fragment of methyl methacrylate bone cement, or Burch-Schneider metal cage can impinge on the nerve; this can cause sciatic nerve palsy which may resolve after the fragment is removed and the nerve freed. [...] The nerve can be surrounded in oxidized regenerated cellulose to prevent further scarring. [...] Sciatic nerve palsy can also result from severe spinal stenosis following the procedure, which can be addressed by spinal decompression surgery.

2500|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{is often}} cited as causing osteoarthritis of the hip at a comparatively young age. [...] Dislocated load bearing surfaces lead to increased and unusual wear. [...] Although there are studies that contradict these findings. [...] (see [...] ) Peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery {{can be used to}} realign the hip joint in some adolescents and adults. Subsequent treatment with <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasty</b> (hip replacement) is complicated by a need for revision surgery (replacing the artificial joint) owing to skeletal changes as the body matures, loosening/wear or bone resorption. Hip resurfacing is another option for correcting hip dysplasia in adults. It is a type of hip replacement that preserves more bone, and may work for younger hip dysplasia patients.|$|E
2500|$|Hip {{replacement}} is {{a surgical}} procedure {{in which the}} hip joint {{is replaced by a}} prosthetic implant, that is, a hip prosthesis. Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such joint replacement orthopaedic surgery is generally conducted to relieve arthritis pain or in some hip fractures. A total hip replacement (<b>total</b> <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasty)</b> consists of replacing both the acetabulum and the femoral head while hemiarthroplasty generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently the most common orthopaedic operation, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely. [...] The average cost of a total hip replacement in 2012 was $40,364 in the United States, and about $7,700 to $12,000 in most European countries.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: One aim {{of modern}} pharmacologic {{treatment}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{is to prevent}} joint destruction and {{reduce the need for}} surgery. Our purpose was to investigate secular trends in the incidence of primary <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> and knee <b>arthroplasties</b> in a well defined sample of patients with RA. Methods: Prevalent cases with RA in 1997 and incident cases from 1997 to 2007 in a community based register in Malmo, south Sweden, were included. Based on a structured review of the medical records, patients were classified according to the 1987 ACR criteria for RA. This cohort was linked to the Swedish <b>Hip</b> <b>Arthroplasty</b> Register (through December 2006) and the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (through October 2007). Patients with a registered <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> or knee <b>arthroplasty</b> before 1997 or before RA diagnosis were excluded. Incidence rates for the period of introduction of TNF inhibitors (1998 to 2001) were compared to the period when biologics were part of the established treatment for severe RA (2002 to 2006 / 2007). Results: In the cohort (n = 2, 164; 71 % women) a primary <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasty</b> was registered for 115 patients and a primary knee arthroplasty for 82 patients. The incidence of primary <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasties</b> decreased from the period 1998 to 2001 (12. 6 / 1, 000 person-years (pyr)) to 2002 to 2006 (6. 6 / 1, 000 pyr) (rate ratio (RR) 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 35 to 0. 76). There was a trend towards an increase of primary knee arthroplasties (incidence 4. 8 / 1, 000 pyr vs. 6. 8 / 1, 000 pyr; RR 1. 43; 95 % CI 0. 89 to 2. 31). Conclusions: Our investigation shows a significant decrease in the incidence of <b>total</b> <b>hip</b> <b>arthroplasties</b> in patients with RA after 2001.
