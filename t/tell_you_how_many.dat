The meal in the first month after surgery, which may extend for a longer period according to experts, is based only on a liquid diet. During this period of rehabilitation, the patient ingests 20 ml of fluid every 10 minutes, and should be followed strictly for proper hydration throughout the day. Liquids like soups, juices and waters, are part of diet and needing to be stored in a container such as a bottle, which generally can do not store them in the correct temperature to facilitate the intake for nutritional education caused by diet on postoperative of bariatric surgery throughout the day. This document aims to present a project {{to improve the quality of}} life of people undergoing surgery to reduce the stomach, through the development of a device called adjustable THERMOBASE, wherein the patient is able to control the temperature of the heating fluid or cooling the machine contact surface, which should be in contact with a container containing the liquid to be consumed according to the model proposed by nutritionists that to monitor post-operative diet.

I am filled with this feverish sense of liberation; it keeps rising to my head like the fumes of strong wine. I find I am an active, sentient, intelligent creature, with desires, with passions, with possible convictions--even with what I never dreamed of, a possible will of my own! I find there is a world to know, a life to lead, men and women to form a thousand relations with. It all lies there like a great surging sea, where we must plunge and dive and feel the breeze and breast the waves. I stand shivering here on the brink, staring, longing, wondering, charmed by the smell of the brine and yet afraid of the water. The world beckons and smiles and calls, but a nameless influence from the past, that I can neither wholly obey nor wholly resist, seems to hold me back. I am full of impulses, but, somehow, I am not full of strength. Life seems inspiring at certain moments, but it seems terrible and unsafe; and I ask myself why I should wantonly measure myself with merciless forces, when I have learned so well how to stand aside and let them pass. Why shouldn't I turn my back upon it all and go home to--what awaits me?--to that sightless, soundless country life, and long days spent among old books? But if a man is weak, he doesn't want to assent beforehand to his weakness; he wants to taste whatever sweetness there may be in paying for the knowledge. So it is that it comes back--this irresistible impulse to take my plunge--to let myself swing, to go where liberty leads me."

Pleasure and pain are empty words to me; what I long for is knowledge--some other knowledge than comes to us in formal, colourless, impersonal precept. You would understand all this better if you could breathe for an hour the musty in-door atmosphere in which I have always lived.
