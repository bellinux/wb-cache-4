40|$|The Bureau of Mines, U. S. Department of the Interior, is {{investigating}} biodegradation of cyanide {{as a means}} of decommissioning heap leach operations. Biological oxidation decreased weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide in process solutions from 50 to 170 ppm down to 0. 1 ppm. The tests were conducted both in <b>trickling</b> <b>column</b> reactors, using quartz as the growth surface, and in upflow columns, using activated carbon as the growth surface. In addition, exploratory tests indicated that bacteria will destroy residual cyanide in leached ore. A flowsheet has been proposed for closure of heap leach operations in which the metals processing portion of the plant, possibly the carbon adsorption columns, or a collection pond is used as a bioreactor. The cyanide in the process solution is destroyed in the bioreactor and the treated water is used to rinse residual cyanide from the spent heaps. The water is recycled until the effluent WAD cyanide concentration meets discharge standards...|$|E
40|$|Trickle bed {{reactors}} (TBRs) exhibit complex hydrodynamics {{and this}} study is aimed at giving insight into whether liquid-solid mass transfer and wetting are influenced by bed depth in a 5 m <b>trickling</b> <b>column</b> using 4 mm glass spheres as random packing. Measurements were made using the novel electrochemical technique developed by Joubert and Nicol (2013). Using this technique the wetting and mass transfer could be measured simultaneously. The study proves that the liquid-solid mass transfer and wetting efficiency do not stabilise at a minimum bed depth. The parameters were found to continue decreasing until {{the bottom of the}} bed. For the upper branch of the hydrodynamic envelope, the rate of decrease for the wetting efficiency was slow {{at the top of the}} bed and decreased rapidly closer to the bottom. However, only the wetting efficiency decreased significantly as a function of bed length; the liquid-solid mass transfer exhibited only a slight decrease of 14 %. This compared well with the results of Du Toit et al. (2014), who found an 11 % decrease in the liquid-solid mass transfer in a column with an x/D value of 29, 4. The lower branch of the hydrodynamic envelope showed a linear decrease with respect to bed length for both wetting and mass transfer. The liquid-solid mass transfer decreased by 50 % from the top of the bed to the bottom. These results are also in agreement with those of Du Toit et al. (2014) 1 who found a decrease of 30 % for a 1, 6 m column. The wetting efficiency for the Levec mode decreased by 52 %, whereas Du Toit et al. (2014) 2 found a decrease of 20 %.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{removing}} CO 2 from gas streams is described. The Carbon Dioxide Continuous Scrubber, CDOCS, {{takes advantage of}} the intimate liquid-gas contact afforded in a packed bubble column to both absorb the CO 2 from a gas stream, and to regenerate the solution. The design relations and performance of a prototype CDOCS system using amine solution are presented. Over a 30 day trial, 20 m 3 /hr of air was continuously scrubbed to 60 - 80 ppm. The CDOCS footprint is less than 0. 18 m 3 with power consumption around 300 W. Applications for air scrubbing include alkaline fuel cells, small scale processing, and industrial safety. A concept is proposed to sweeten bio-gas from dairy farm effluent for on-farm electricity generation. While industrial processes involving packed or plate <b>trickle</b> <b>columns</b> are well known for CO 2 production and sweetening, these conventional methods are complex and expensive, and do not scale down to air scrubbing or to small scale biogas production...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{data from}} large <b>trickle</b> bed <b>columns</b> are scarce. In this study, {{pressure}} drop, liquid holdup, and transition from low interaction regime to high interaction regime were investigated in a pilot-scale <b>trickle</b> bed <b>column</b> of 13 in. inner diameter and 8 ft. bed height, using air-water system at atmospheric pressure. Data {{were collected in}} the low gas superficial velocity range, {{which has not been}} covered extensively in literature. Gas flow rate was varied from 0 to 400 SLPM (standard liter per minute), i. e., 0 ? 70 mm/s, and liquid flow rate was varied from 0 to 60 gpm (gallons per minute), i. e., 0 ? 45 mm/s. The system was prewetted in high interaction regime before taking each measurement. Pressure and liquid load were measured using sensors, while flow regime transition was observed visually and by noting the standard deviation in pressure drop. The aim {{of this study is to}} record and analyze hydrodynamic data that can closely match that of industrial-scale reactors. The experiments showed hysteresis, indicating multiplicity of hydrodynamic states. For experiments following a consistent prewetting procedure, significant deviation was observed from the pressure drop and liquid holdup correlations in literature. At lower liquid flow rates, flow is gravity driven, while drag forces come into play as liquid flow is increased. In addition, at higher liquid flow rates, liquid holdup is overestimated by correlations from studies on lab-scale <b>trickle</b> bed <b>columns.</b> Lastly, flow regime transition agreed with existing flow maps in literature, with the observation of local pulsing in the bed...|$|R
40|$|A hydrogenotrophic {{denitrification}} reactor {{was designed}} {{for the removal of}} nitrate from aquaria. An average hydrogen gas transfer up to 130 mg per day from the gas to the water phase was accomplished by recirculating the water from the denitrification reactor over a separate <b>trickling</b> filter <b>column</b> with a volume of 1. 3 l. During batch experiments removal rates up to 36 mg N/l reactor per day were recorded at a hydraulic residence time of 12 h. To avoid the need for storage of large volumes of hydrogen gas in aquarium or aquaculture applications, an electrochemical cell was used to generate hydrogen gas.

The exit gases from this stage contain both SO2 and SO3 which are passed through intermediate absorption towers where sulfuric acid is <b>trickled</b> down packed <b>columns</b> and SO3 reacts with water increasing the sulfuric acid concentration. Though SO2 too passes through the tower it is unreactive and comes out of the absorption tower.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{cell and}} tissue culture is an {{established}} {{alternative to the}} harvest and extraction of whole plant material {{for the production of}} valuable secondary metabolites. Colchicine, a secondary metabolite of Colchicum autumnale and Gloriosa superba has anti-mitotic and anti-inflammatory properties, has been used for centuries in the treatment of gout and more recently for familial Mediterranean fever, and has been recognized for some time as an anti-tumour agent. This thesis investigated the biotechnological application of cell and tissue cultures of Colchicum autumnale and Gloriosa superba. Two analytical methods (HPLC and ELISA) have been developed and optimised for determination of the colchicine accumulated in liquid medium and in plant tissue. Callus tissue of Colchicum autumnale and callus and root tissue of Gloriosa superba has been established, growth kinetics and accumulation of colchicine examined, and culture optimized for accumulation of colchicine. Precursor feeding has been investigated and yields of colchicine have been increased in both plant cells and root cultures by the addition of relatively low levels of suitable precursors. Total Colchicine accumulated in Colchicum autumnale culture fed with ImM coumaric acid was 180 (ig/g dry weight compared to 63 (_ig/g dry weight for the control and the same treatment to the Gloriosa superba culture accumulated 85 |_ig/g dry weight compared to 22 (j,g/g dry weight for the control. Continuous extraction of colchicine using Amberlite resin as a solid phase extraction has been demonstrated to increase production. Combination of precursor feeding with in situ extraction led to significant enhancement of colchicine production and recovery using a continuous in situ extraction system. Combination of precursor feeding and adsorption on an Amberlite column significantly enhanced the total colchicine accumulation {{at the end of the}} batch culture by 3. 5 and 3. 7 fold in a culture supplemented with 0. 5 mM coumaric acid or 3 -phenyl propionic acid respectively. The growth rate of Gloriosa superba root culture in liquid medium can be estimated by simple, reliable and non-invasive methods by measuring the conductivity and the amount of soluble carbohydrate in the liquid medium. A simple model for enhanced production of colchicine has been developed. In this study the two types of bioreactor, air-lift bioreactor and <b>trickle</b> <b>column</b> bioreactor systems were examined for growing Gloriosa superba root tissues on a pilot scale...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} rapid sand {{filtration}} on NOM in reduced groundwater, groundwater with high concentrations of iron, ammonia, manganese and NOM was treated in a pilot plant consisting of a <b>trickling</b> filter <b>column</b> (TFI) followed by a wet type filter column (WFII) and a separate wet type filter column (WFsep). The organic carbon flow (adsorption + biodegradation) was calculated from the biomass detected in iron sludge. The influence of the filtration process on BOM was investigated by AOC and BDOC determinations. The results showed that the decrease of the organic carbon content by TFI and WFsep was caused by adsorption onto iron flocks and biodegradation. The bioprocesses in TFI and WFsep were responsible for BDOC reduction. Predominant production of AOC by TFI and predominant AOC reduction by WFsep suggested that the AOC was effected by chemical reactions depending on the oxygen concentration in the filter layer and the contact time in the filter column. Thus, for groundwater treatment by rapid sand filtration wet type filtration should always be preferred. If trickling filtration is necessary for elimination of high iron and ammonia contents contact time in the filter column should be as short as possible. (orig.)

40|$|Hydrogen is {{the most}} {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe and exists under three isotopic forms: protium, deuterium and tritium. Protium is commonly used {{in a variety of}} industries including electronics, metallurgy, chemistry and petrochemistry. Deuterium and tritium have taken more roles in both civil and defence nuclear industries and biomedical sciences. Today water treatment systems at nuclear sites remove many contaminating debris isotopes, with the exception of tritium. This is because tritiated waters have traditionally been particularly difficult and expensive to treat while they can spread easily if they escape into the environment. The topic of separation and purification of tritium and deuterium has a considerable value. Among the numerous separation methods of hydrogen isotopes, H 2 -H 2 O liquid catalytic exchange has attracted interest because of its mild operating conditions, high efficiency, limited corrosion and toxicity. The method of hydrogen-water liquid catalytic exchange has many possible applications such as; producing and upgrading heavy water, producing light water and removing tritium from light and heavy waters for recycling to fusion reactors or for low level nuclear deposits. This thesis presents the hydrogen-water isotope exchange reaction that is taking place co-currently and counter-currently through a <b>trickle</b> bed <b>column.</b> Numerical simulations were performed by process design and fluid flow modelling. The missing physical properties of deuterium, and particularly of tritium isotopologues in gaseous and water forms, were predicted and validated with existing literature data. Moreover, suitable operating parameters were approached allowing isotopic exchange to be performed under favourable performance. Intrinsic fluid flow studies by 3 D modelling offered more understanding of various underlying phenomena taking place at the local scale and provided identification of main hydrodynamic characteristics in a trickle bed reactor including trends of pressure drop, liquid holdup and catalyst wetting efficiency. The activity of the catalytic process in terms of rate of conversion was discussed through the effect of operating conditions and was validated by a comparison with experimental data and literature...|$|R
40|$|Trickle flow is {{encountered}} {{in a variety}} of process engineering applications where gas and liquid flow through a packed bed of stationary solid. Owing to the complexities of three interacting phases, a fundamentally exhaustive description of trickle flow hydrodynamics has not been achieved. A complicating factor in describing the hydrodynamics {{is the fact that the}} hydrodynamic state is dependent not only on the present operating conditions but also on their entire history, including fluid flow rate changes and pre-wetting procedures. This phenomenon is termed hydrodynamic multiplicity and is the subject of this work. Hydrodynamic multiplicity greatly complicates both the experimental investigation into the behaviour of a <b>trickle</b> flow <b>column</b> and the theoretical modelling of the observed behaviour. Broadly speaking, this study addresses hydrodynamic multiplicity on three levels. First, a conceptual framework is proposed that can be used to study hydrodynamic multiplicity with limited resources. It is based on the absolute limiting values that the hydrodynamic parameters can adopt for a certain set of conditions, and encompasses both flow rate hysteresis loops and pre-wetting procedures. There are 5 such hydrodynamic modes. When the existing literature is critically evaluated in light of this framework, it is established that the reported experimental studies have not addressed all the issues. Previous modelling attempts are also shown to be unable to qualitative explain all the existing data. Moreover, authors have suggested different (and often contradictory) physical mechanisms responsible for hydrodynamic multiplicity. Secondly, an experimental investigation intended to supplement the existing literature and illustrate the utility of the proposed framework is launched. This includes bed-scale measurements of liquid holdup, pressure drop and gas-liquid mass transfer for a variety of conditions including different flow rates, pressures, particle shapes, particle porosity and surface tension. The second part of the experimental effort uses radiography and tomography in new ways to visualise the temporal and spatial characteristics of the different hydrodynamic modes. The tomographic investigation incorporates advanced image processing techniques in order to culminate in a pore-level evaluation of the hydrodynamic modes that reveals additional features of hydrodynamic multiplicity. Thirdly, the experimental insights are condensed into a set of characteristic trends that highlight the features of hydrodynamic multiplicity. A pore-level capillary mechanism is then introduced to qualitatively explain the observed behaviour. The mechanism shows how the differences in advancing and receding contact angles and the characteristics of the packed structure (or pore geometries) are ultimately responsible for the observed hydrodynamic multiplicity behaviour. Lastly, the effect of hydrodynamic multiplicity on trickle bed reactor performance is discussed. It is established experimentally that depending on the reaction conditions, different modes yield optimal performance. The idea of optimizing the performance by manipulating the hydrodynamic state is introduced. In totality, this work advances the understanding of trickle flow hydrodynamics in general and hydrodynamic multiplicity in particular.

40|$|Aerosols are a {{suspension}} of solid or liquid particles in gas. The size of particles ranges from about 0. 001 #mu#m to 100 #mu#m. The concentration of aerosol varies from 10 " 2 1 /cm" 3 to 10 " 9 1 /cm" 3. Before industrialisation aerosols came from natural sources, for example, salt particles from ocean spray or smog from volcanic eruption. But nowadays aerosols are also {{produced in the}} industry, such as automobiles, industrial combustion processes with coal, biomass or waste, and so on. These aerosols affect not only visibility and climate, but also our health {{and quality of the}} life. The European directive 1999 / 30 /EG (1999) sets stringent limits for sub-micron particle immission in the air until year 2010. The new TA-Luft and the 17. BImSchV have set stringent particle emission limits for waste incinerators in Germany. Therefore, aerosols or particles in flue gas from industrial combustion processes have to be separated before the flue gas emits into the air. The goal of this work is to develop a low-cost process to decrease sub-micron particles in flue gas from waste incinerator. This thesis reports the experimental investigations and theoretical study on separation of particles in flue gas from waste incinerator. A simple process has been developed in this work for separation of sub-micron particles in flue gas from waste incinerator. This process consists of a quench, a packed <b>column</b> <b>trickled</b> with circulation water, a Multiwir-packing trickled with water and a Kimre-droplet-separator. The FLUENT-simulation indicates in the Multiwir-packung three flows: kernel flow in canal (Z), half-spiral canal-comprehensive flow in a packing layer (N) and direction-changed flow in the near of packing wall (U). By the flows Z and N the particles are separated weakly. In contrast by the flow U the particles are separated considerably. The result of the simulation is very well consistent with the experiment result. Furthermore, the experimental curves of separation efficiency are approximately simulated. The calculation indicates that the temperature of flue gas plays an important role for the particle separation. (orig.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{influence}} of media size upon the effective removal of organic waste from a liquid substrate was studied {{by the use}} of three experimental trickling filters under a set of uniform operating conditions. The range of experiments involved hydraulic loadings of increasing magnitude and of constant organic strength. The <b>trickling</b> filter <b>columns</b> consisted of three 18 -foot, 5. 8 -inch diameter pipes with ports cut at various levels to permit the taking of samples and observation of conditions existing within the media mass. The media selected for the analysis were 9 / 16 -, 7 / 8 - and 1 - 1 / 4 -inch diameter marbles which were placed in the columns in such numbers that the surface areas were related in the ratio of the inverse diameter of the marbles. The data collected for a basis of analysis were COD, BOD, film quantity, pH, ORP and temperature at influent, 1 -, 2 -, 4 -, 8 -, 12 - and 18 -foot or effluent levels. The other variable introduced intentionally was the hydraulic loading rate which started at 15 mgad and was increased to 75 mgad in 15 mgad steps between data test runs. A data test run consisted of five consecutive tests at each sampling point for each of the items selected as data basis. The performance of the three filter columns was measured in terms of BOD and COD removals. These performance data were subjected to an analysis of variance to detect significant differences between columns. There were observable differences in Columns II and III, but at the 90 percent significance level the analysis of variance showed a similarity in treatment capacity at each level and each rate applied between these filter units. Failure to pass hydraulic loads above 45 mgad put Column I out of the test series. This left Columns II and III for comparison at the 60 and 75 mgad rates. The performance of the filter columns showed that the 9 / 16 -inch marbles were not a practical size media for use in a trickling filter, as clogging and ponding made the filter very hard to maintain and operate. COD and BOD removals became less and less, and the filter failed to function satisfactorily above the 45 mgad rate. The 7 / 8 - and 1 - 1 / 4 -inch media both maintained treatment capacity at the maximum rates applied. The measurable conditions indicated a much greater removal of organic load in total organic material removed at the higher rates than at the lower rates even though effluent quality deteriorated. The high rates of application favor the creation of a healthy environment for bacterial growth in providing better ORP and pH conditions. The media size and thus surface area is shown to be of great influence in the establishing of optimum treatment conditions. The media size should be small enough to provide for a large amount of surface area per unit volume of media yet large enough to provide for a pore space giving adequate reaeration and fluid passing channels. The smallest media tested does not meet these requirements, while the larger size media tested appeared to meet them better at the higher rates of application...|$|R
