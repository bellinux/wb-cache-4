5|$|One of Gheorghe Tătărescu's last {{appearances}} in public was his stand {{as one of}} the prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had been premier (Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges). Released in 1955, Tătărescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later. According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he,</b> as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E

They grew up in Golden Valley, Minnesota, where Craig Taborn attended Breck School. His parents gave him a Moog synthesizer as a present when he was 12, which was also around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> started playing piano. He received basic instruction initially from his father, who played by ear. Taborn borrowed records from a public library and listened to public radio, discovering music from the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and Sun Ra, among others. As a youth he also listened to heavy metal and contemporary classical music, and identified commonalities among these disparate forms of music.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Fragments of Him {{is based}} on {{the life and death of}} Will, a man who dies early in the game. The player controls four characters throughout the game; Will, his ex-girlfriend, his boyfriend at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died, and his grandmother. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also on those of the other characters, and how they cope with his death. The game relies heavily on its narrative which, although the player controls the game in the first-person, is described by the developer as being viewed in a second-person perspective, i.e. where the player is not directly controlling a character but instead indicates what the characters should interact with next.|$|E
25|$|Garbarek {{was born}} in Mysen, Norway, {{the only child of}} a former Polish {{prisoner}} of war, Czesław Garbarek, and a Norwegian farmer's daughter.

25|$|Friedländer is an Intentionalist on {{the origins}} of the Holocaust question. However, Friedländer rejects the extreme Intentionalist view that Adolf Hitler had a master plan going back to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote Mein Kampf for the {{genocide}} of the Jewish people. Friedländer, through his research on the Third Reich, has reached the conclusion that there was no intention to exterminate the Jews of Europe before 1941. Friedländer's position might best be deemed moderate Intentionalist.|$|E
25|$|Differences between Colin and Barry {{become too}} great to overcome; Barry's inconsiderate {{behaviour}} exasperates Colin and their age gap causes further problems when the police discover that Barry had been under the legal {{age of sexual consent}} for homosexuals (21 at <b>the</b> <b>time)</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> began living with Colin. The police decide it is their duty to inform Barry's parents. Petrified of his homophobic father, Barry ultimately decides to end his relationship with Colin on New Year's Eve 1987.|$|E

25|$|Incidents were {{reported}} of Thomson delivering byes which hit the sight-screen behind the facing batsman on the full, {{after just one}} bounce on the pitch.

25|$|The {{concept of}} a continuous, single-movement symphony was one Sibelius only reached after a long process of experimentation. His Symphony No.3, dating from 1907, {{contained}} three movements, an earlier fourth movement having been fused into the third. The final result was successful enough for Sibelius {{to use the same}} idea in his Symphony No.5, completed in 1915. Although his first mention of No.7 occurred in December 1918, the source for its material has been traced back to around 1914, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was working on the Fifth.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First Mafia War in 1962-63 and the Ciaculli Massacre that prompted the first concerted Antimafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy, Genco Russo was among the many mafiosi arrested (on February 6, 1964, when he turned himself in).

However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> learned of what was happening, he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath, who died shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{short time}} between {{his release from}} prison and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was sent to the}} United States has been seen as a sign that he had links to the Romanian Securitate. This idea has been {{supported}} by Ion Mihai Pacepa, who argued in a 1992 book that Archimandrite Bartolomeu was an agent of the External Intelligence department of the Securitate who was sent to the United States to divide the Romanian community. Anania has admitted that he signed denunciations against other high-ranking clerics for the Securitate in 1959, but he claims that he was not a collaborator and that these denunciations were made after he was given tea containing a truth drug at the Securitate's Ploiești headquarters.|$|E
