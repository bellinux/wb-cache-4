5|$|Stanford's {{victory in}} the Orange Bowl caused a massive jump {{in the number of}} season ticket sales at the school.

5|$|A September 1999 {{report from}} Baird's {{ministry}} showed that 10,600 workfare placements {{had been created}} in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1999, a figure which the Toronto Star observed was significantly lower than that which had been predicted by the government. Baird indicated that he would continue with the workfare program, and {{that the proportion of}} welfare recipients on workfare would be increased from 15% to 30%.|$|E

5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run serially during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> operation, {{the subway}} was {{operated}} {{as a single}} system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 2008, {{the drive}} shaft of a Danish AW101 broke, {{leading to an}} {{emergency}} landing at Billund Airport. Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.|$|E

5|$|The ship figured {{prominently}} {{in the development of}} the IJN's carrier striking force doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power. A revolutionary strategic concept at the time, the employment of the doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, the Analytical Review lay dormant {{until it was}} briefly revived as The Analytical Review (New Series) during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.|$|E
5|$|All royal {{charters}} issued during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> Mary's reign {{emphasized that}} she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to {{the very idea of}} a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E

30|$|Informal caregivers, {{especially}} partners, {{are faced}} with providing care of greater intensity to elderly patients during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> after a hip fracture. The CarerQoL {{was not associated with}} the intensity of the provided informal care. However, this study shows that a considerable group of informal caregivers for elderly patients with a hip fracture experienced relational, physical and mental health problems that stemmed from providing intensive informal care during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b>|$|R
5|$|In January 1905, Yamashita {{got a job}} {{teaching}} judo at the U.S. Naval Academy. There {{were about}} 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, Robert L. Ghormley. The position ended {{at the end of}} the school term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year. When President Roosevelt heard of this, he spoke to the Secretary of the Navy, who in turn told the Superintendent of the Naval Academy to rehire Yamashita. Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the Naval Academy throughout <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1906.|$|E
5|$|During 2013 {{took place}} {{a surge in}} sales of plug-in hybrids in the European market, {{particularly}} in the Netherlands, with 20,164 PHEVs registered during the year. Out of the 71,943 highway-capable plug-in electric passenger cars and utility vans sold in the region during 2013, plug-in hybrids totaled 31,447 units, representing 44% of the plug-in electric vehicle segment sales that year. This trend continued in 2014. Plug-in hybrids represented almost 30% of the plug-in electric drive sales during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2014, and {{with the exception of}} the Nissan Leaf, sales of the previous European best selling models fell significantly, while recently introduced models captured a significant share of the segment sales, with the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, Tesla Model S, BMW i3, Renault Zoe, Volkswagen e-Up!, and the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid ranking among the top ten best selling models.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1932. Arriving via New York he {{was pleased}} {{to be reunited with}} his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E

5|$|In November 1888, Karim {{was given}} four months' leave {{to return to}} India, during which time he visited his father. Karim wrote to Victoria that his father, who was due to retire, had hopes of a pension and that his former employer, John Tyler, was angling for promotion. As a result, {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1889, Victoria wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, demanding action on Waziruddin's pension and Tyler's promotion. The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor, Sir Auckland Colvin, that he desired only gratitude and also because Tyler {{had a reputation for}} tactless behaviour and bad-tempered remarks.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for his father on the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmithâ€™s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there until four months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R. Smith.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was next}} to star in a {{television}} adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's short story Rain for NBC, but the project fell through as the network {{did not want to}} hire her choice of director, Lee Strasberg. Instead of working, she spent <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1961 preoccupied by health problems. Monroe underwent surgery for her endometriosis, had a cholecystectomy, and spent four weeks in hospital care â€“ including a brief stint in a mental ward â€“ for depression. She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|The {{accidents}} on {{its opening}} day gave the Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{huge amounts of}} publicity, and greatly increased {{public awareness of the}} potential of rapid transport. The L's passenger service proved immediately successful. In October the Duke of Wellington's special train was put into use as a dedicated first-class train, making four journeys each day between Liverpool and Manchester in each direction. On 4 December 1830 goods operations on the L began, with Planet hauling 75 tons of freight from Liverpool to Manchester. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1831 the L carried 188,726 passengers and 35,800tons of goods; in the year from the opening in September 1830 to September 1831, almost 500,000 passengers were carried. At George Stephenson's insistence new locomotives bought by the L were fitted with handbrakes from 1831.|$|E
5|$|The club colours {{have not}} always been sky blue. The {{predecessor}} club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts, and this kit was still used for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1910 after MalmÃ¶ FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to show that MalmÃ¶ FF was a new, independent club. This colour combination has on occasion been used in modern times as the away kit. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920. Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured {{on the back of the}} shirt just below the neck.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{surviving}} sources {{about the}} reign of Caligula, although he {{is described as a}} noble and moderate emperor during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania as a province.|$|E
