5|$|In the {{short-term}} low carbohydrate diets appear better than low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in <b>the</b> <b>obese.</b> Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E

30|$|Carpenter {{attributed}} these {{increases to}} Cook, yet this attribution is problematic {{in light of}} the case law discussed in Section  2. Cook was an outlier decision with respect to coverage of obesity under the 1990 ADA. At most, Cook might have improved employment outcomes of <b>the</b> morbidly <b>obese</b> in <b>the</b> First Circuit. 17 But Carpenter found no improvements in nationwide employment for the morbidly obese; he only found improvements in nationwide employment for <b>the</b> regularly <b>obese.</b> Moreover, Carpenter only examined nationwide employment outcomes, not outcomes specific to the First Circuit. To determine whether employment outcomes of <b>the</b> morbidly <b>obese</b> improved in <b>the</b> First Circuit after Cook, Appendix Table 9 replicates Carpenter’s results, restricting his nationwide data to observations from the First Circuit only. According to these estimates, employment of <b>the</b> morbidly <b>obese</b> may have actually declined for {{men and women in the}} First Circuit after Cook (although the point estimates are not statistically significant). In sum, whatever was driving the increases in employment outside the First Circuit for <b>the</b> regularly <b>obese</b> in <b>the</b> mid- 1990 s, it does not appear to be the Cook decision.|$|R
30|$|Obtaining a {{pneumoperitoneum}} in obese {{patients can}} be particularly challenging due to increased abdominal wall thickness and preperitoneal fat. The percentage of women requiring more than one attempt at laparoscopic entry was highest in <b>the</b> morbidly <b>obese</b> group when compared with women in all other weight ranges. This is likely due to the Veress needle dissecting into the preperitoneum more frequently in <b>the</b> morbidly <b>obese</b> patients despite attempting insertion through {{the base of the}} umbilicus. Direct entry under vision using the Endopath® Xcel Bladeless Trocar was a useful way of obtaining primary entry in <b>the</b> morbidly <b>obese</b> and was selected more frequently in this subgroup of patients.|$|R
25|$|The life {{expectancy}} of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly ten to twenty years. Other demographics that {{tend to have a}} lower {{life expectancy}} than average include transplant recipients, and <b>the</b> <b>obese.</b>|$|E
25|$|A study {{concluded}} that a polymorphism was associated with higher fasting insulin levels in <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> patients only. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} the melanocortin pathway may modulate glucose metabolism in obese subjects indicating a possible gene-environment interaction. POMC variant may be involved in the natural history of polygenic obesity, contributing to the link between type 2 diabetes and obesity.|$|E
25|$|CD36's {{association}} {{with the ability to}} taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in taste bud cells (TBC) of obese sand rats (P. obesus) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in obese rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. Taste bud cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from obese mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be obese (but not in normal weight mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing to behavior changes in <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} {{of children}} {{has also shown}} to be a serious cause, and children who fail to engage in regular physical activity are at greater risk of obesity. Researchers studied the physical activity of 133 children over a three-week period using an accelerometer to measure each child's level of physical activity. They discovered <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> children were 35% less active on school days and 65% less active on weekends compared to non-obese children.|$|E
25|$|Leptin, however, plays a {{different}} role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce leptin, leptin levels are elevated in <b>the</b> <b>obese.</b> However, hunger remains, and- when leptin levels drop due to weight loss- hunger increases. The drop of leptin is better {{viewed as a}} starvation signal than the rise of leptin as a satiety signal. However, elevated leptin in obesity is known as leptin resistance. The changes {{that occur in the}} hypothalamus to result in leptin resistance in obesity are currently the focus of obesity research.|$|E

When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was amused by the comic situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors.|$|E
25|$|Feelings of {{depression}} {{can cause a}} child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered {{that there was not}} a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression. Of all <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> adolescents, 8.2% had said to be depressed, compared to 8.9% of the non-obese adolescents who said they were depressed. Antidepressants, however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Daniel Lambert" [...] entered {{common use}} in English speech and writing, {{to refer to}} any fat man. His name {{continued}} in this use long after {{the details of his}} life had been largely forgotten; in 1852, Charles Dickens remarked that [...] "Lambert's name is known better than his history". Dickens's Nicholas Nickleby compares <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> GeorgeIV to Lambert, and William Makepeace Thackeray used the term in Vanity Fair to refer to <b>the</b> <b>obese</b> Joseph Sedley, and in The Luck of Barry Lyndon to refer to the fat servant Tim. As time progressed, [...] "Daniel Lambert" [...] came to mean anything exceptionally large; Herbert Spencer's The Study of Sociology used the phrase [...] "a Daniel Lambert of learning", while Thomas Carlyle referred sarcastically to Oliver Cromwell as [...] "this big swollen Gambler and gluttonous hapless 'spiritual Daniel Lambert'". In 1874, The Times, in reviewing the newly translated French comedy La Fiammina by Mario Uchard in which a character is named [...] "Daniel Lambert", noted that the name is [...] "always associated in the English mind with the notion of obesity", and in 1907, almost 100 years after Lambert's death, the Château de Chambord was referred to as [...] "the Daniel Lambert among châteaux". Nellie Lambert Ensall, at the time the heaviest woman in Britain, claimed in 1910 to be Daniel Lambert's great-granddaughter, but her claim is likely to be untrue; Lambert was unmarried and is unlikely to have had any children.|$|E

Sega responded with a statement from Sega of America president Tom Kalinske saying that Nintendo [...] "should spend more time improving their products and marketing rather than working on behind-the-scenes coercive activities." [...] Ultimately, this debate would have little impact on sales for the Game Gear.|$|E
