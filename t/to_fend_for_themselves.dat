40|$|The {{separation}} {{of children from}} their families have {{a large number of}} social and economic aspects. At least the economic aspects are under-researched. At the point of transition of leaving their families somehow the children have to be considered as separate decisionmakers. This is the perspective I adopt in this essay. The question raised is whether poverty, changes in social norms or external shocks to the family system such as the AIDS epidemic, lead the children <b>to</b> prematurely <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

50|$|Sydney brown trapdoors {{are usually}} shy and retiring, {{although}} the occasional individual {{will stand up}} and show its fangs if harassed inside its burrow. They {{spend most of the}} time in their burrows. At night, they are waiting for food in front of their burrows. Mature male Sydney brown trapdoors wander during humid weather in search of a mate. Mating takes place within the female's burrow. Usually the male escapes being eaten in order to mate with several females, before dying. The eggs are kept in the mother's burrow in a cocoon. After hatching, the spiderlings stay in the burrow for some time and eventually emerge <b>to</b> disperse and <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, but some of their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
5000|$|They {{continue}} their courtship dance, swimming {{with each other}} around the nest until the female descends to deposit her eggs in the nest. The female will lay 2,000 to 26,000 eggs and leave them for the male to guard. He keeps watch over them until they hatch in three to five days, while protecting them and fanning them with his fins, keeping them clean and providing them with oxygenated water. When they hatch, the fry remain near the nest for a few days, then leave <b>to</b> feed and <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> [...] After the eggs have hatched, the male will often seek to attract another female to lay her eggs in his nest.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{element of}} urban climate {{resiliency}} {{focuses on the}} social agents (also described as social actors) present in urban centers. Many of these agents depend on the urban centers for their very existence, so they share a common interest of working towards protecting and maintaining their urban surroundings. [...] Agents in urban centers {{have the capacity to}} deliberate and rationally make decisions, which {{plays an important role in}} climate resiliency theory. One cannot overlook the role of local governments and community organizations, which will be forced to make key decisions with regards to organizing and delivering key services and plans for combating the impending effects of climate change. [...] Perhaps most importantly, these social agents must increase their capacities with regards to the notions of “resourcefulness and responsiveness. [...] Responsiveness refers to the capacity of social actors and groups to organize and re-organize, as well as the ability to anticipate and plan for disruptive events. Resourcefulness refers to the capacity of social actors in urban centers to mobilize varying assets and resources in order to take action. [...] Urban centers will be able <b>to</b> better <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> in the heat of climatic disturbances when responsiveness and resourcefulness is collectively achieved in an effective manner.|$|R
40|$|The {{mercenary}} {{profession is}} arguably the second oldest profession in the world. The context surrounding the mercenary soldier has changed and evolved throughout time while the practice itself has remained almost the same. The mercenary still exists today and although the current international environment has changed the way the profession is viewed, a mercenary is still a soldier who accepts compensation for services rendered. The end of the Cold War {{proved to be a}} benchmark in the mercenary trade. The cessation of the rivalry between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, meant that many smaller countries had <b>to</b> now <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> The military and monetary aid that had flowed into allied countries from the superpowers ceased. The end of the Cold War created a space for mercenary companies to fill. Mercenarism was growing once again. There has been an increase in the literature on mercenaries since the Cold War. However, there has been little focus on the change from mercenaries to private military companies (PMCs) and their evolving role in international relations. Most of the literature focuses on case studies but lacks an in-depth exploration of the roles PMCs play. This study explores the rise of PMCs since the Cold War, focusing on the changing international environment in which non-state actors (NSAs), and PMCs in particular, have grown in prominence. The roles played by PMCs have also changed from the old stereotype of mercenary warfare to a range of activities that include actual combat as well as logistical support and peacekeeping. Prof. D. J.

5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but usually only {{in the event of a}} failure of mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{women in the}} Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women. They held various roles {{including}} prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American, Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing {{to be left behind}} <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities. On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> as the Turkish army approached the capital of Yerevan. At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of Yerevan. Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army. The opposing armies met on May 28, 1918, near Sardarapat. The battle was a major military success for the Armenian army as it was able to halt the invading Turkish forces. The Armenians also stood their ground at the Battle of Kara Killisse and at the Battle of Bash Abaran. The creation of the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became the ruling party. However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.|$|E
40|$|Immediately {{after the}} Second World War, the word ‘consumer’ was an {{ill-defined}} signifier. By the early eighties, citizens’ interests were often routinely equated with consumer interests. We can attribute this {{in no small}} amount {{to the rise of}} consumer movements, who published comparative tests in monthly periodicals. These private organizations became the proverbial ‘consumer trade unions’: they drew attention to the producer consumer-cleavage and raised consumer awareness. In Belgium there were two separate consumer movements. Test-Achats (1957 -present) promoted individual foresight as the best strategy for consumer protection. The working-class Union Féminine pour l’Information et la Défense du Consommateur (hereafter ufidec, 1959 - 1984) was an organization led by social-democratic women. ufidec demanded more legal solutions from consumers and believed in strong collective action. This article investigates how and why consumer organizations gained influence and legitimacy within the welfare state. The government initially rebuffed organized consumerism, only to accommodate it somewhat after the oil crisis in 1973. However, if institutions (or proposed institutions) for consumer politics in Belgium remained relatively weak or ineffective, it was because they represented a compromise between a civil society intent upon its own survival, and a government more than willing <b>to</b> let consumers <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> </p...|$|R
500|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in late May or June. A clutch {{of one or}} two olive-brown oval eggs with dark brown spots is laid which take 24 to 25 days to hatch, with both parents taking turns to incubate. [...] The nest is usually placed along steep lake shorelines where the adults can quickly dive {{underwater}} when approached by predators. The eggs are about [...] long and [...] wide and the two eggs are laid with an interval of one to three days between them, and hatch [...] The newly hatched chicks are sooty black and have a white belly. Within hours of hatching, the young begin to leave the nest with the parents, swimming close by and sometimes riding on one parent’s back. The parents and chicks initially stay in shallow and isolated bays where the parents are able to defend the chicks better. The chicks are capable of making shallow dives from their first day but make deeper dives as they grow. Fledging takes 70 to 77 days. Usually, only one brood is raised. [...] Both parents feed the chicks live prey from hatching to fledging and as they grow, they become able <b>to</b> feed and <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> after about two months. The parent birds capture small fish and hold them crosswise in their bill, call and approach the chicks with their head lowered so that the chicks can grasp them. If food is scarce, the young may fight intensely, and often only one young survives. The chicks leave the breeding ground before ice formation in the fall. A pair of loons raising two chicks have been estimated to feed on 423kg of fish during the five and a half months that they spend in their breeding territory. Some common loons live to 20 years or more, the maximum recorded age being 29 years 10 months.|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Psychology) In {{the context}} of poverty, {{political}} turmoil and HIV/AIDS, {{it has become more}} difficult for parents {{to take care of their}} children accordingly. This problem is especially pronounced in Africa and contributes to the formation of child- and youth-headed households (CYHHs). The emergence of such households places children and youth at risk of vulnerability to exploitation, poverty and lack of access to education and resources. This means that these children and youth need <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> and provide <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Given the dominant position of boys in African cultures, they may be in a better position to take care of and provide for their families. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe and understand the gendered experiences of 12 - to 14 -year-old African male learners living in CYHHs and, based on this, to suggest possible support interventions to assist them. A qualitative multiple case study design was used, where seven male learners from the Soweto area participated in the data collection process. These learners were identified through a non-profit organisation (NPO) in the Soweto area. The data collection process included the use of individual interviews, collages, and essays. These were analysed using qualitative content analysis methods, as stipulated by Zhang and Wildemuth (2009). The study is explorative in nature and, given the issues of gender being addressed, a social constructionist paradigm was used. The theoretical framework included the works of two prominent theorists in the field of developmental psychology – Erikson (1963, 1968) and Nsamenang (1992, 2005, 2006). Erikson provides valuable insights into the psychosocial experiences of adolescents, whereas Nsamenang explains the relevance of development in an African context. Their ideas were used to understand the findings in relation to the development of the participants...|$|R
5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves,</b> but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E

5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an {{emigration}} office there, Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left <b>to</b> <b>fend</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E
