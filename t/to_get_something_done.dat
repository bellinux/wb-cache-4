500|$|The Intelligent Woman's Guide, Shaw's main {{political}} treatise of the 1920s, attracted both {{admiration and}} criticism. MacDonald considered it the world's most important book since the Bible; Harold Laski thought its arguments outdated {{and lacking in}} concern for individual freedoms. Shaw's increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements. [...] A New York Times report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin: [...] "hey are trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>done,</b> [...] are adopting methods by which {{it is possible to}} get something done". As late as the Second World War, in Everybody's Political What's What, Shaw blamed the Allies' [...] "abuse" [...] of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler, and hoped that, after defeat, the Führer would escape retribution [...] "to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country". These sentiments, according to the Irish philosopher-poet Thomas Duddy, [...] "rendered much of the Shavian outlook passé and contemptible".|$|E

2500|$|In March, {{only weeks}} after taking office, Camacho Solís changed the charged {{atmosphere}} between SEDUE {{and the community}} groups. He actively integrated Tlateloloco citizen groups into a new program meant for that area, defusing the most volatile area of the city. Camacho Solís continued to work to integrate and smooth relations between his agency and the community groups. On 16 May 1986, Camacho Solís met with the heads of all the major groups. He offered a commitment to build 48,000 housing units in one year if the groups would all sign a [...] "Convenio de concertación democrática para la reconstrucción de vivienda" [...] (Democratic agreement for the reconstruction of housing). Basically, this document required the cooperation of community groups in exchange for solid commitments from the agency. All sides would compromise in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>done.</b> The deal generally worked; movements like CUD moderated their stances and agencies like SEDUE and PRHP made progress in rebuilding housing, regardless of political affiliation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Lynch {{moved with}} his wife and {{daughter}} to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place that he would later describe as being [...] "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... you quickly learned that if you were going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>done,</b> you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [...] He began writing a script for a proposed work titled Gardenback, which had [...] "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his Gardenback project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing {{that he was one of}} the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that Gardenback was [...] "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called Eraserhead.|$|E

60|$|December 3.--R.P.G.[53] {{came to call}} {{last night}} to excuse himself from dining with Lockhart's friends to-day. I really fear he is near an actual standstill. He has been {{extremely}} improvident. When I first knew him he had an excellent estate, {{and now he is}} deprived, I fear, of the whole reversion of the price, and this from no vice or extreme, except a wasteful mode of buying pictures and other costly trifles at high prices, and selling them again for nothing, besides an extravagant housekeeping and profuse hospitality. An excellent disposition, with a considerable fund of acquired knowledge, would have rendered him an agreeable companion, had he not affected singularity, and rendered himself accordingly singularly affected. He was very near being a poet--but a miss is as good as a mile, and he always fell short of the mark. I knew him first, many years ago, when he was desirous of my acquaintance; but he was too poetical for me, or I was not poetical enough for him, so that we continued only ordinary acquaintance, with goodwill on either side, which R.P.G. really deserves, as a more friendly, generous creature never lived. Lockhart hopes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>done</b> for him, being sincerely attached to him, but says he has no hopes till he is utterly ruined. That point, I fear, is not far distant; but what Lockhart can do for him then I cannot guess. His last effort failed, owing to a curious reason. He had made some translations from the German, which he does extremely [well]--for give him ideas and he never wants choice of good words--and Lockhart had got Constable to offer some sort of terms for them. R.P.G. has always, though possessing a beautiful power of handwriting, had some whim or other about imitating that of some other person, and has written for months in the imitation of one or other of his friends. At present he has renounced this amusement, and chooses to write with a brush upon large cartridge paper, somewhat in the Chinese fashion,--so when his work, which was only to extend to one or two volumes, arrived on the shoulders of two porters, in immense bales, our jolly bibliopolist backed out of the treaty, and would have nothing more to do with R.P.[54] He is a creature that is, or would be thought, of imagination all compact, and is influenced by strange whims. But he is a kind, harmless, friendly soul, and I fear has been cruelly plundered of money, which he now wants sadly.|$|E

There was some stigma attached to the failure, too, although the blame did not rest upon Mr. Falsom, but with his partner. Worry and anxiety aggravated the heart trouble from which he had suffered for some time, and a month later he died. Alexina and Stephen were left alone to face the knowledge that they were penniless, and must look about for some way of supporting themselves. At first they hoped to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in Thorndale, {{so that they might}} keep their home. This proved impossible.

5000|$|... …if {{you really}} want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{anything}} done, {{it is not so}} much a matter of whether you alienate sympathy; sympathy is a very unsatisfactory thing if it is not practical sympathy.

What she wants is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>something</b> practical <b>done,</b> and whether it is done out of sympathy or whether it is done out of fear…doesn't particularly matter so long as you get it. We had enough of sympathy for fifty years; it never brought us anything, and we would rather have an angry man going to the government and saying, my business is interfered with and I won't submit to its being interfered with any longer because you won't give women the vote, than to have a gentleman come onto our platforms year in and year out and talk about his ardent sympathy with woman’s suffrage.|$|R

Then, something is done to the world i.e. take action to move oneself or manipulate someone or something. Finally, the checking is required if the goal was made.
