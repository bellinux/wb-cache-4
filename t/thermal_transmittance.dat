Earlier there was no such calculation procedure, and determination of these parameters was made by means of the difficult experimental measurements. In this study the submerged jet theory is applied for calculation of these parameters. Subject of the theoretical analysis is the flat fan sprays which flow from the system of slot-hole sprinkler.

30|$|The {{burning of}} trees and grasses {{produces}} charred particles, such as charcoal and soot, that can be transported over long distances via winds and rivers to coastal, deltaic, and ocean environments, where they are preserved in sediments. Charcoal contained in sediments has been widely used {{as a proxy for}} biomass burning and human activities as well as climate change. Charcoal and soot in Cenozoic marine sediments at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition (Exp.) 346 Site U 1423 were measured to examine the regional history of biomass burning in East Asia. Charcoal and soot were measured as elemental carbon (EC) in coarse (>[*] 2  μm) and fine (<[*] 2  μm) fractions using grain size separation by repeated settling followed by application of a <b>thermal</b> optical <b>transmittance</b> (TOT) method. Organic carbon (OC) was also quantified during the process. EC and OC in both coarse and fine fractions are higher from 0 to 1.8  Ma and lower from 1.8 to 4.3  Ma but have large variations, which suggest more frequent or intense biomass burning since 1.8  Ma. Terrestrial biomass and precipitation could be major controls on the EC supply. Fine EC varies independently from coarse EC, which suggests a remote origin of fine EC. Large increases in terrestrial vegetation cover have led to high-temperature burning, which is associated with interglacial stages.|$|R

50|$|ISO 9869 {{describes}} {{how to measure}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>transmittance</b> of a roof or a wall by using heat flux sensor.

When the heat flux is monitored over a sufficiently long time, the <b>thermal</b> <b>transmittance</b> can be calculated by dividing the average heat flux by the average difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the building.

40|$|This report {{could be}} used as a {{guideline}} for building owners on the possible risks and benefits of various energy retrofit options available to them. There are also best-practice examples provided which show projects of retrofitting and what should be considered and how the improvements can be implemented. Potential risks for retrofitting will be addressed in detail; most of them are related to: - Thermal bridges; - Moisture damages; - Uncertain cost calculation; - Improvement on ventilation (airflow, efficiency, thermal comfort). The advantages can be summarized as: - Increased living thermal comfort (indoor climate); - Use of existing building structure; - Cost savings for heating energy. These aspects are illustrated from different views of the Annex 55 participating countries. Most of the contributing countries are located in Europe: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia and Sweden; while three countries are from North-/ South- America: Brazil, Canada and the USA The energy consumption for the space conditioning of buildings can be reduced by the appropriate combination of several measures: - insulation of components: roof, wall and floor, - application of insulating glazing - airtightness of buildings, - orientation of buildings and rooms for the use of passive solar energy, (not a retrofit option) - use of an efficient and environment-friendly heating system, - installation of comfortable and efficient ventilation, - use of renewable energy as heating support, -use of heat pumps as heating support, - solar shading to avoid overheating in dwellings. Several studies have shown that the most efficient way to curb the energy consumption in the residential building sector (new & existing) remain the reduction of the heat loss by improving the insulation of the building envelope (roof, floor, wall & windows). Thermal insulation (combined with the application of high performance windows) holds a key position among these measures, which lay the foundation of low-energy building. The basic rules for low-energy building are - the reduction of energy demand and - production of the remaining demand more effectively and preferably - from renewable sources. The chapters of this report are organized by country to quickly guide the reader to find information which is relevant for to the reader or to inform about the statistics of other countries. In the end of each chapter, there is a compilation and overview of all countries, which summarizes the overall similarities and trends and points out major differences. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the energy consumption in residential buildings. This chapter should help to estimate the total effort and potential for each country in general. Chapter 3 covers the national regulation standards in order to provide the designer a scheme where to look for relevant standards and general references. The national regulations are birefly summarized and the most important information is highlighted. Chapter 4 highlights the most important data which should be considered when building new residential buildings or retrofit existing ones.

A total of 72 workers in five MHW collection companies were assessed over a period of 7 days from June to September 2014. Respirable EC/OC samples were quantified using the <b>thermal</b> optical <b>transmittance</b> method. BC and PM 2. 5 were measured using real-time monitors, an aethalometer and a laser photometer. All results were statistically analyzed for occupational and environmental variables to identify the exposure determinants of DPM. The geometric mean of EC, OC, TC, BC and PM 2. 5 concentrations were 4. 8, 39. 6, 44. 8, 9. 1 and 62. 0 μg/m 3, respectively. EC concentrations were significantly correlated with the concentrations of OC, TC and BC, but not with those of PM 2. 5. The exposures of the MHW collectors to EC, OC, and TC were higher than those of the drivers (p< 0. 05). Workers of trucks meeting Euro 3 emission standard had higher exposures to EC, OC, TC and PM 2. 5 than those working on Euro 4 trucks (p< 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the job task, European engine emission standard, and average driving speed were the most influential factors in determining worker exposure.

40|$|Carbonaceous species, usually {{classified}} into two categories, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), constitute {{an important component}} of the atmospheric aerosol. Carbonate carbon (CC), or inorganic carbon, another constituent of carbonaceous material, is often not considered in many atmospheric chemistry studies. The reason for this may be its low contribution to fine particle mass in most areas studied, along with the difficulties in its analytical determination in atmospheric aerosols. The objective of this study was the quantification of atmospheric carbonate concentrations using the <b>thermal</b> optical <b>transmittance</b> method (Sunset Laboratory, Inc.). Three different temperature protocols (two modified NIOSH protocols and the EUSAAR- 2 protocol) were tested on filter samples containing known amounts of CC. Moreover, the performance of the two most widely used protocols across European countries (NIOSH and EUSAAR- 2) was also checked on two different instruments namely the semi-continuous OCEC analyzer and the laboratory OCEC analyzer. NIOSH- 840 thermal protocol (NIOSH protocol with a maximum temperature of 840 °C in the He-mode) can be used for the detection and quantification of atmospheric carbonate concentrations. CC was determined in ambient PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samples From Athens and Barcelona by using the NIOSH- 840 thermal protocol. The results confirm that in South European countries CC may constitute a significant fraction of carbonaceous aerosols (~ 15 %), thus it should not be neglected. However, the NIOSH- 840 protocol seems to overestimate the OC concentrations when compared to the EUSAAR- 2 protocol. The results suggest that during dust episodes, common for the Southern Europe, the analytical laboratories could use the NIOSH- 840 protocol as a suitable method for the carbonate determination and manually integrate the sharp peak that appears in the maximum temperature step in the inert mode. Afterwards, carbonate should be evaporated by a fumigation method and one could then apply the EUSAAR- 2 protocol for the precise determination of OC and EC fractions...|$|R
