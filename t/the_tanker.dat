5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of <b>the</b> <b>tanker,</b> the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
5|$|Local {{shipping}} {{accidents are}} among {{the responsibilities of the}} Phoenix. In September 1965, the Norwegian freighter MS Berganger collided with <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> Independent, resulting in fires aboard the ships. Phoenix responded along with U.S. Coast Guard fireboats to quickly put out the freighter's blaze, but <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> took longer to extinguish. A year later, a gasoline barge collided with rocks near the shore. While Phoenix and the Coast Guard were investigating, the barge exploded killing two Coast Guardsmen and one nearby workman. Phoenix rescued a third Coast Guardsman with severe injuries, and fought to snuff the blaze. Flaming, floating gasoline proved difficult to subdue. In December 2011, a tourist DUKW boat suffered an engine fire while in McCovey Cove, and Phoenix doused the flames while the Coast Guard rescued the passengers and crew.|$|E
50|$|Malek {{stated that}} local Taliban had stolen <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> {{in order to}} provide fuel to local villagers, who {{surrounded}} <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> to siphon fuel when they became stuck in the riverbank. By his estimate, between 1/5 and 1/4 of those present were armed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> wing's KC-135Q <b>tankers</b> {{also contributed}} during the 1991 Gulf War. Carrying U-2 support people and equipment, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> allowed <b>the</b> wing to deploy {{immediately}} and begin flying reconnaissance missions over the region. During this initial deployment, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> escorted F-117A stealth fighters {{to the war}} zone, then served as the F-117's primary refuelers during the war.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> cost around US$200 million each.|$|R
5|$|No. 55 Squadron RAF {{operated}} B.1 and B.1As from RAF Honington from October 1960, {{moving to}} RAF Marham and receiving B.1(K)A tankers in May 1965. These {{were replaced by}} K.2 in July 1975, with the squadron continuing to operate Victors in <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> role until disbanding in October 1993.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of <b>the</b> <b>tanker,</b> rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where the driver of <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers {{of the car and}} the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E
5|$|One Yak-15 {{was used}} to test a {{prototype}} aerial refueling system in 1949, although the installation on the fighter and the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber used as <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> were both dummies to test procedures and fit.|$|E
50|$|The battalion’s final assault into Germany {{commenced}} late on 26 February 1945, with 87th {{attacking the}} West Wall near Ormont. <b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> cooperated with tank destroyers (TD’s) armed with 90 mm guns to systematically reduce pillboxes in the West Wall, {{clearing the way}} for the infantry to seize first Ormont, then Reuth and Kerschenbach by 5 March. The renewed offensive also highlighted disagreements between <b>the</b> experienced <b>tankers</b> and <b>the</b> relatively untried 87th. Although usually resolved amicably enough, the strains between <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> and usually more senior but less experienced infantry commanders surfaced regularly until the infantry gained experience and developed confidence in the abilities of <b>the</b> <b>tankers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beginning on 22 December, the {{infantry}} with tank support advanced to Rambrouch and Grosbous with limited attacks {{further to the}} northwest. The 26th was still a mostly untried unit, and <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> were surprised at {{the infantry}}’s lack of fluency in working with tanks, and by their reluctance to enter towns in the area, and on several occasions <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> fought unsupported in the towns. They also encountered numerous Panther, Tiger, and even King Tiger tanks. Despite the inferiority of their Sherman tanks, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> were able to account for some dozen tanks {{by the end of}} the year against the loss of 5 Shermans.|$|R

5|$|The startup {{process and}} {{construction}} {{as a whole}} {{came to an end}} on August 1, 1977 when <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> ARCO Juneau sailed out of Valdez with the first load of oil from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.|$|E
5|$|In Valdez, where Fluor had supervision, {{the work}} also was divided among several contractors. Site {{preparation}} {{work was done}} by Morrison-Knudsen. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> berths were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated the pipes. Fluor also had supervision {{of the construction of}} the pumping stations, which were generally built by the contractors working on a specific section of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India {{enterprise}} {{under the}} aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of her crude oil tankers in honour of the Param Vir Chakra recipients. The crude oil tanker named MT Major Somnath Sharma, PVC was delivered to SCI on 11 June 1984. <b>The</b> <b>tanker</b> was phased out after 25 years service.|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} and war engine {{remains on the}} surface; the elite [...] "Yance-men". Their president, Talbot Yancy, delivers inspirational speeches to <b>the</b> <b>tankers,</b> motivating them to increase their production of leadies and win the war. The war does eventually end. However, the Yance-men design a conspiracy to maintain {{the wealth of the}} Earth for themselves. Yancy continues to describe devastation in televised speeches. <b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> continue to produce leadies.|$|R
50|$|He was the namesake of <b>the</b> oil <b>tanker,</b> <b>the</b> MS D. G. Scofield which was, on 1 May 1939, <b>the</b> first oil <b>tanker</b> to load oil in Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> {{were built}} in 1979 at Newport News Shipbuilding's {{shipyard}} in Newport News, Virginia. Each vessel cost approximately 136.4 million USD.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India {{enterprise}} {{under the}} aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of its crude oil tankers in honour of the PVC recipients. <b>The</b> <b>tanker</b> MT Lance Naik Karam Singh, PVC was delivered to SCI on 30 July 1984, and served for 25 years before being phased out. The government also built a memorial in his honour at the District Administrative Complex in Sangrur.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1959, a B-52 {{from the}} 492d Bomb Squadron at Columbus AFB, Mississippi {{carrying}} 2 nuclear weapons collided in midair with a KC-135 tanker near Hardinsburg, Kentucky; 4 of the 8 crew {{members on the}} bomber and all 4 crew on <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> were killed. One of the nuclear bombs was damaged by fire but both weapons were recovered.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1983, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry {{collided}} with a KC-135A Tanker aircraft over Saudi Arabia during Operation ELF-1. Both aircraft were recovered back to Riyadh Air Base. <b>The</b> <b>Tanker</b> received substantial damage, with parts impact and loss of pressure, as well as shut down of the two starboard engines. The E-3 received severe damage with the partial loss of a left wing section.|$|E

50|$|Finally, on 8 February, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> began infiltrating {{forward to}} attack {{positions}} for the {{crossing of the}} Roer River. Although the attack was planned for 10 February, it was postponed when the Germans destroyed the discharge valves on the Schwammenauel Dam, causing a steady but long lasting flooding of the Roer River. It wasn’t until 23 February that floodwaters receded enough for the attack to finally proceed. In the predawn darkness of 23 February, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> provided direct fire support {{from the west bank}} of the Roer for the infantry's predawn attack and the Americans seized Jülich by the end of the day. The 29th Infantry Division continued their attack north toward Mönchengladbach, with <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> supporting <b>the</b> 175th and 115th Infantry Regiments. The Americans encountered similar resistance as they had west of Jülich, having to reduce strongpoints centered on each town along their march route, with German tanks, self-propelled guns and antitank guns located in well-concealed positions to engage the tanks from the flanks. Despite the Germans’ skilled defense, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> noted <b>the</b> reduced resistance compared to their attack on Jülich and reached Mönchengladach on 1 March 1945.|$|R
25|$|More than {{eighty percent}} of <b>the</b> <b>tanker's</b> 77,000 tons of fuel oil is now {{thought to have been}} spilled off Spain's north-west coast.|$|R
5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. <b>The</b> <b>tanker</b> broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E
5|$|The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a Government of India {{enterprise}} {{under the}} aegis of the Ministry of Shipping, named fifteen of her crude oil tankers in honour of the Param Vir Chakra recipients. The crude oil tanker named MT Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane, PVC was delivered to SCI on 8 August 1984. <b>The</b> <b>tanker</b> was phased out after 25 years service.|$|E
5|$|There {{were a few}} regular {{carriers}} left by the 1920s, one of whom ran Jackson's Navy, using {{horses to}} tow the barges, and steam tugs after 1930. When the company stopped trading in 1948, sugar beet traffic was carried to Ely in boats owned by the beet factory for another ten years. Fuel oil for the pumping stations was supplied by <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> barge Shellfen until 1971, by which time the Well Creek was almost impassible.|$|E

50|$|British Tanker Company Limited was the {{maritime}} transport {{arm of the}} Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the forerunner of BP. <b>The</b> British <b>Tanker</b> Company was formed in 1915 with an initial fleet of seven oil <b>tankers.</b> <b>The</b> Company became <b>the</b> BP <b>Tanker</b> Company in 1955.|$|R

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a {{lightning}} bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a fire on the ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on <b>the</b> <b>tanker</b> in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. <b>The</b> <b>tanker</b> order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Alaska-class oil <b>tanker</b> is a {{class of}} VLCC tankers built by National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, San Diego. <b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> are double-hulled as {{mandated}} by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and will replace the existing fleet used by BP in the Alaskan area.|$|R
25|$|After {{almost a}} decade of {{successful}} operation without icebreaker assistance Tempera and Mastera remain the only double acting <b>tankers</b> operating in <b>the</b> Baltic Sea. While other double acting ships have {{been built in the}} recent years, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> operated by Neste Shipping are also the only ones equipped with a bulbous bow designed primarily with open water performance in mind — <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> and container ships built for the Russian Arctic have a more traditional icebreaking bow due to the more severe ice conditions.|$|R
50|$|In early October, a {{composite}} company {{consisting of the}} 76 mm gunned tanks recently fielded in the battalion and the 105 mm assault guns was formed to support the attack on Fort Driant. The tanks received special concrete piercing ammunition and towed “snakes”, long tubes of explosive similar to Bangalore torpedoes {{to be used for}} clearing obstacles. <b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> supported <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment in the assault starting on 3 October. <b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> cleared a number of obstacles and helped beat back a number of determined German counterattacks with use of their coaxial machine guns. Both the special ammunition and the snakes were disappointing failures. <b>The</b> <b>tankers</b> suffered heavy losses, losing nine of sixteen tanks and 24 men killed, wounded or captured by 7 October, but enabled the infantry to penetrate the outer reaches of the fort. Afterward, while the infantry were able to make modest gains against fierce German resistance, <b>the</b> <b>tankers</b> were not able to play a further role in the pitched battles in and under the bunkers, and the remaining tanks were kept on as part of the mobile reserve for the attack. After the infantry suffered heavy losses attempting to penetrate into the main bunkers, the attack was abandoned and the infantry withdrew on 13 October.|$|R
