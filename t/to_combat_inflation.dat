In an effort <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>inflation</b> and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009. In 2016 Zimbabwe allowed trade in the United States dollar and various other currencies such as the rand (South Africa), the pula (Botswana), the euro, and the Pound Sterling (UK).|$|E

25|$|On {{a broader}} front, the economy {{initially}} recovered {{at a brisk}} pace from the 1973–75 recession. Incoming president Jimmy Carter instituted a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy. However, inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978, and rose by double digits following the 1979 energy crisis. In order <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>inflation,</b> Carter appointed Paul Volcker to the Federal Reserve, who raised interest rates and caused a sharp recession {{in the first six}} months of 1980. In March 1980, Carter introduced his own policies for reducing inflation, and the Federal Reserve brought down interest rates to cooperate with the initiatives.|$|E
25|$|The NKVD {{were ordered}} to {{catalogue}} the scale of destruction during the war. It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed. They recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned. In the war's aftermath, some of Stalin's associates suggested modifications to government policy. Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. Stalin allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war. Academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom than they had prior to 1941. Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>inflation</b> and promote economic regeneration, in December 1947 Stalin's government devalued the ruble and abolished the ration-book system. Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but reinstalled in 1950.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the program}} {{received}} widespread support in Congress, Treasury officials opposed it. In a letter, Treasury secretary W.Michael Blumenthal wrote, [...] "I {{do not believe}} the U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression to be created that it cannot or will not take the necessary steps <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>inflation</b> and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation." [...] Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions, the public would believe that the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold. Despite these objections, the bill was attached to the bank omnibus bill, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on November 10, 1978.|$|E

25|$|Inflation {{levels and}} trends: Typically a {{currency}} will lose value {{if there is}} a high level of inflation in the country or if inflation levels are perceived to be rising. This is because inflation erodes purchasing power, thus demand, for that particular currency. However, a currency may sometimes strengthen when inflation rises because of expectations that the central bank will raise short-term interest rates <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> rising <b>inflation.</b>|$|R

After the Panic of 1893, Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which had required the U.S. government to regularly purchase silver {{to support the}} dollar, in order <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> expected <b>inflation.</b> With {{the loss of a}} customer representing such {{a large portion of the}} market, many of Aspen's mines cut back production or closed outright. The Holden company declared bankruptcy, and the bank's inability to recover any of the loan led ultimately to it suffering the same fate.|$|R

50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> rising <b>inflation,</b> {{recently}} appointed {{chairman of}} the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker, elected to increase the federal funds rate. Following the October 6, 1979 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the federal funds rate increased gradually from 11.5% to an eventual peak of 17.6% in April 1980. This caused an economic recession beginning in January 1980, and in March 1980, president Jimmy Carter created his own plan for credit controls and budget cuts to beat inflation. In order to cooperate with these new priorities, the federal funds rate was lowered considerably from its April peak.|$|R
50|$|Factors that {{economists have}} pointed to as {{potentially}} causing or contributing to the downturn include: troops returning from the war which created a surge in the civilian labor force and more unemployment and wage stagnation, a decline in agricultural commodity prices because of the post-war recovery of European agricultural output which increased supply, tighter monetary policy <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> the postwar <b>inflation</b> of 1919, and expectations of future deflation that led to reduced investment.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the [...] "Winter of Discontent", the Callaghan {{government}} had sought (in 1976) an International Monetary Fund loan of £2.3bn <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> the rampant <b>inflation</b> at that time. Although the media reported {{this as a}} humiliation for a former imperial power working to rebuild its economy after World War II and the nadir of the post-war economic period, this in itself led to only a narrow lead for Margaret Thatcher's party in October 1978 in opinion polls.|$|R

50|$|Assuming {{a closed}} economy, where foreign capital or trade {{does not affect}} the money supply, when money supply increases, {{interest}} rates go down. Businesses and consumers have a lower cost of capital and can increase spending and capital improvement projects. This encourages short-term growth. Conversely, when the money supply falls, interest rates go up, increasing the cost of capital and leading to more conservative spending and investment. The Federal reserve increases interest rates <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>Inflation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Principal {{causes of}} the 1980 {{recession}} included contractionary monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> double digit <b>inflation</b> and residual effects of the energy crisis. Manufacturing and construction failed to recover before more aggressive inflation reducing policy {{was adopted by the}} Federal Reserve in 1981, causing a second downturn. Due to their proximity and compounded effects, they are commonly referred to as the early 1980s recession, an example of a W-shaped or [...] "double dip" [...] recession; it remains the most recent example of such a recession in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The Wassenaar Agreement was an {{agreement}} reached in 1982 between employers' organisations and labour unions in the Netherlands to restrain wage growth {{in return for}} the adoption of policies <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> unemployment and <b>inflation,</b> such as reductions in working hours and the expansion of part-time employment. The agreement has been credited with ending the wage-price spiral of the 1970s, greatly reducing unemployment and producing strong growth in output and employment. The International Labour Organization describes the Wassenaar as [...] "a groundbreaking agreement, setting the tone for later social pacts in many European countries".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} dynamically inconsistent monetary policy where an exchange rate target is implemented <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> excess <b>inflation.</b> The model highlights three important determinants of credibility and stability of an exchange rate target regime: competing government objectives, design of monetary institutions, and verifiability. It is shown that reduced flexibility in terms of tending to competing government objectives and {{a low level of}} central bank independence (as measured by the severity of the time-consistency problem) reduces the credibility of the regime. However, increased flexibility is shown to reduce the ability for agents to verify {{the true nature of the}} exchange rate target and impose short-term welfare costs which may destabilize the regime. Consequently, my model identifies a possible tradeoff between increased flexibility (leading to increased long-run credibility) and reduced verifiability (giving rise to large short-run costs due to a slow verifiability process...|$|R
5000|$|The {{programs}} of liberalization and stabilization {{were designed by}} Yeltsin's deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar, a 35-year-old liberal economist inclined toward radical reform, and widely known as an advocate of [...] "shock therapy". Shock therapy was originally used in Bolivia by notable economist Jeffery Sachs <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>inflation</b> in the 1980s. Having achieved some major successes in Bolivia, shock therapy was then imported to the Polish context following {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, and Russia shortly after.|$|E
5000|$|The Panic of 1893 {{ended the}} city's early growth. Congress {{repealed}} the Sherman Act <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> <b>inflation.</b> With the market {{no longer so}} sustained, the price of silver dropped and many mines became unprofitable and closed. Miners then went to work elsewhere. The houses that had been built fell vacant as the city entered a period now known as its [...] "quiet years" [...] when its population dwindled to ultimately less than a thousand by 1930.|$|E

50|$|He {{graduated}} with a doctorate in Experimental Psychology from the University of Göttingen in 1921, and worked in Germany until 1933, both as a journalist and as a psychological researcher. Originally trained as a Gestalt psychologist working on problems of learning and memory, during the Second World War he became involved in American government attempts to use psychology <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> war-induced <b>inflation.</b> This led him to consider the application of psychological principles to macroeconomics, devising measures of consumer expectations that eventually became the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Use of this index enabled him to predict the post-war boom in the United States {{at a time when}} conventional econometric indicators were predicting a recession, a success which helped his fledgling index establish itself. Katona wrote numerous books and journal articles advocating the development of economic psychology. These general ideas were taken up more fully in Europe than in the United States until the development, after his death, of modern behavioral economics.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>combat</b> the grade <b>inflation</b> {{prevalent}} at many top US institutions, Princeton {{began in the}} autumn of 2004 to employ guidelines for grading distributions across departments. Under the new guidelines, departments have been encouraged to re-evaluate and clarify their grading policies. The administration suggests that, averaged {{over the course of several}} years in an individual department, A-range grades should constitute 35% of grades in classroom work, and 55% of grades in independent work such as Senior Theses. These guidelines are enforced by the academic departments. Since the policy's inception, A-range grades have declined significantly in Humanities departments, while remaining nearly constant in the Natural Science departments, which were typically at or near the 35% guideline already.|$|R

However, Correa has also acknowledged {{that it would be}} politically and economically impossible to abandon that policy now. After his election victory of 15 April 2007, he pledged to maintain dollarisation during the entire four years of his administration, though he also indicated his support for the idea of replacing the US dollar with a regional South American currency {{at some point in the}} future.|$|R
