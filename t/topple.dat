5000|$|The {{stabilization}} of chip configurations obeys {{a form of}} least action principle: each vertex <b>topples</b> no more than necessary {{in the course of}} the stabilization. This can be formalized as follows. Call a sequence of <b>topples</b> legal if it only <b>topples</b> unstable vertices, and stabilizing if it results in a stable configuration. The standard way of stabilizing the sandpile is to find a maximal legal sequence; i.e., by <b>toppling</b> so long as it is possible. Such a sequence is obviously stabilizing, and the Abelian property of the sandpile is that all such sequences are equivalent up to permutation of the <b>toppling</b> order; that is, for any vertex , the number of times [...] <b>topples</b> is the same in all legal stabilizing sequences. According to the least action principle, a minimal stabilizing sequence is also equivalent up to permutation of the <b>toppling</b> order to a legal (and still stabilizing) sequence. In particular, the configuration resulting from a minimal stabilizing sequence is the same as results from a maximal legal sequence.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} root {{configuration}} and soil cultivation on stability of juvenile Pinus radiata D. Don were studied in New Zealand plantations. Roots of <b>toppled</b> and stable trees were excavated, and morphological {{features of the}} two sets were assessed and analysed in pairs. It was concluded that straight-grained taproots and sinker roots reduced the likelihood of <b>toppling.</b> The amounts of <b>toppling</b> in seven cultivation trials were assessed between ages 1 and 5. Cultiva-tion varied in its effect on <b>toppling</b> frequency, because of differences in tree size, soil strength, and vertical root developmen...|$|R
5|$|The Lý dynasty which ruled Dai Viet (Vietnam) married its princesses off to {{regional}} rivals to establish alliances with them. One of these marriages was between a Lý empress regnant (Lý Chiêu Hoàng) {{and a member}} of the Chinese Trần (Chen) clan (Trần Thái Tông), which enabled the Trần to then <b>topple</b> the Lý and established their own Trần dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The hero's {{story begins}} with a {{flashback}} dream {{of the death of}} his parents {{at the hands of the}} Dark Lord, the ruler of the nation of Granz. Upon waking, the hero, a gladiator-slave in Granz, attempts to escape before being confronted by the Dark Lord and thrown off of a bridge. After being fished out of a lake, the hero is advised to head to the city of <b>Topple.</b> The heroine's story also {{begins with a}} flashback dream of the Dark Lord and his assistant, Julius, killing her stepmother and destroying her village. Upon awaking, she is advised by the knight Bogard to head to <b>Topple,</b> while he journeys to the city of Wendell. The hero and heroine meet in <b>Topple,</b> and agree to journey together. They head toward Wendell, and along the way discover that women of the Mana tribe, which the heroine belongs to, are being kidnapped by vampires. The heroine is kidnapped, and is rescued by the hero and an unnamed man; they discover that the kidnappings are to keep the woman safe from the Dark Lord and Julius, who are killing them all in part because the tribe was unable to save the Dark Lord's mother from a terrible fate.|$|E
5|$|Category1 storms usually cause no {{significant}} structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures; however, they can <b>topple</b> unanchored mobile homes, {{as well as}} uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, the storm can still produce widespread damage and can be a life-threatening storm.|$|E
25|$|Besides playing games, {{another use}} of dominoes is the domino show, which {{involves}} standing them on end in long lines {{so that when}} the first tile is <b>toppled,</b> it <b>topples</b> the second, which <b>topples</b> the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the domino effect.|$|R
40|$|<b>Toppling</b> and {{hillside}} creep in layered rocks {{share the}} characteristics of rotation of layers under gravity. It has been observed that some <b>toppling</b> processes tend toward self-stabilization. The potential for self-stabilization of these processes is greatly influenced by the degree of constraint provided by surrounding material. The degree of constraint is reduced by the <b>toppling</b> surface daylighting on the slope surface. <b>Toppling</b> slope failure typically involves a daylighting failure surface whereas hillside creep by <b>toppling</b> of layers can occur on a surface which may be parallel to the slope surface. The failure surface is termed the <b>toppling</b> hinge surface for both block and flexural <b>toppling.</b> A review of published field photographs and selected field examples, identified as hillside creep of layered rocks, indicates that {{it is common for}} the rotated layers to form a mirror image symmetry across the <b>toppling</b> hinge surface. The mirror image condition is a unique condition in which the strain parallel to the slope is equal in the initial and <b>toppled</b> orientations. Prior to reaching the mirror image condition, the strain parallel to the slope is less than the initial condition resulting in low confining stress across layer boundaries, thus facilitating motion. Rotation beyond the mirror image condition causes extensional strain parallel to the slope, which cannot be accommodated without additional disturbance such as freedom of movement of blocks at the slope toe and/or crest. Structural data collected in the Maitai Valley, South Island, New Zealand gives an example of the field observations associated with self-stabilized creep-toppling...|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to <b>topple</b> Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E

Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book Philosophy of the Revolution during the siege.|$|E
5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} {{of a civil}} war between two rival Korean regimes, each of which was supported by external powers, with each of the regimes trying to <b>topple</b> the other through political and guerrilla tactics. The conflict was expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950, until the armistice (ceasefire agreement) was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E

The hardest hit was Edgecumbe, with damage to approximately 50% of its houses. There was extensive damage to its milk factory, with large storage tanks <b>toppled.</b> Railway tracks in the town were bent and buckled, and an 80-tonne New Zealand Railways DC class locomotive <b>toppled</b> over.|$|R
40|$|As is known, {{there are}} many {{fractures}} in rock slope, and these fractures are often the cause of failure. Especially, the mechanism of <b>toppling</b> failure depends on fractures in rock slope. In this paper, two-dimensional simulation analysis and visualization for <b>toppling</b> failure of rock slope by distinct element method are carried out. In related with this simulation, the tensile stress of rock mass can be tried to be expressed by bonding theory. The rock slope model with this analysis can be freely setting the slope shape {{and the location of}} joints. Using this analytical model, it is tried to be simulated an actual <b>toppling</b> failure of rock slope. As the results of this analysis, it is recognized that this simulation can be expressed on this <b>toppling</b> failure phenomena. Moreover, the process of <b>toppling</b> failure can be visualized...|$|R

5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was old enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to <b>topple</b> Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since he thought there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to <b>topple</b> the Lithuanian government.|$|E

5|$|Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{had become}} the key {{logistical}} artery for PAVN and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF or commonly, Viet Cong), {{in their effort to}} conduct military operations to <b>topple</b> the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E
5|$|France invaded {{and began}} occupying Syria in 1919 and {{following}} the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, Faisal was exiled and the kingdom annulled. Al-Bakri left for Amman in Transjordan, which was {{under the authority of}} Faisal's brother King Abdullah. Al-Bakri would later serve as Abdullah's aide in 1921, a position he held for about two years before returning to Syria after the French issued amnesty for political exiles. On his return, he became a member of al-Shahbandar's People's Party and actively sought to <b>topple</b> the French authorities in Syria and align the country with the ruling Hashemites in Iraq, Transjordan and the Hejaz. The Hashemites were driven out of the latter in 1925 by the Saudis.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency to <b>topple</b> the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy of containment and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E

5|$|The Chartered Company's native commissioners {{began to}} fear a {{possible}} tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people {{to emulate the}} Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and telling them (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to <b>topple</b> the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions.
