5|$|The use of crests {{was once}} {{restricted}} {{to those of}} 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests. They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they {{did not participate in}} war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them.</b> Some heraldists are also of the opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E

50|$|Some teams {{occasionally}} wore their throwbacks {{in additional}} games during the season, and the San Francisco 49ers <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> through the Super Bowl.

25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism do not {{generally}} require women to wear head coverings. Some more traditional Conservative synagogues may ask that married women cover their heads during services. However, some more liberal Conservative synagogues suggest that women, married or not, wear head-coverings {{similar to those}} worn by men, and some require it (or require it only for women receiving honors or leading services from the bimah), not for modesty, but as a feminist gesture of egalitarianism. Almost all Conservative synagogues require men to wear a head covering (usually a kippah), but in Reform synagogues, there is often no requirement. However, kippot may be provided to anybody who wishes <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Football League first {{introduced}} {{the use of}} a permanent third jersey on September 6, 1994 when the Calgary Stampeders wore black uniforms for the Labour Day Classic against the Edmonton Eskimos. The CFL did not have a rule for use of alternate uniforms and teams were able <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> as often or as little as they liked, a rule that is still in effect today. Teams are also able to wear multiple alternate jerseys within the same season, as seen with the Montreal Alouettes during their 2009 campaign when they wore alternate black, blue, and throwback jerseys, in addition to their regular home and away uniforms. Teams are also permitted to wear their third jerseys as the away team, provided that they do not clash with the home team's uniforms. Despite teams having no restrictions with third jerseys, only the Stampeders chose <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> during the 1990s, presumably due to the league's financial struggles during this decade. As such, no CFL USA team ever wore an alternate uniform. The Alouettes were the next team to introduce third uniforms in 2001 when they also wore black uniforms; a colour that {{was not part of the}} team's colour scheme. The Saskatchewan Roughriders first wore their black alternates in 2002 as it became more normal for teams to wear these jerseys. The BC Lions wore orange retro uniforms twice during the 2003 season as part of the celebrations for their 50th season, but those were only worn for that season.|$|E

25|$|Early in his career, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of his first stablemaster, Konishiki was primarily oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques such as oshi-dashi and tsuki-dashi that would win the bout as quickly as possible. Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent's mawashi and rely on his huge weight advantage <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by yori-kiri (force out), and his lack of ability to change tack once he had been sidestepped {{was one of the}} concerns raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when he was up for promotion.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, Powell {{repeatedly}} banged {{his head}} into the iron walls of his cell aboard the Saugus. Whether this was a suicide attempt (as his jailers believed) or not, it deeply alarmed military officials. A canvas padded hood, with only a slit for the mouth and nostrils, was fashioned. Powell and all the other prisoners aboard the monitors were forced <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to prevent any further suicide attempts. Only Mary Surratt and Dr. Mudd were not required to wear the hoods. Powell cried when the hood was placed on him. The hoods were hot, claustrophobic, and uncomfortable, and in the humid confines of the monitors in the steaming Washington summer the prisoners suffered immensely. On June 6, Hartranft ordered them removed—except for Powell's.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year in}} Santo, Speck {{moved with}} his mother, his stepfather, and his sister Carolyn to the East Dallas section of Dallas, Texas, living at ten {{addresses}} in poor neighborhoods over the next dozen years. Speck loathed his often drunk and frequently absent stepfather, who psychologically abused him with insults and threats. Speck, a poor student who needed glasses for reading but refused <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them,</b> struggled through Dallas public schools from fourth through eighth grade, repeating eighth grade at J. L. Long Jr. High School, {{in part because he}} refused to speak in class because of a lifelong fear of people staring at him. In autumn 1957, Speck started ninth grade at Crozier Technical High School, but failed every subject and did not return for the second semester in January 1958, dropping out just after his 16th birthday.|$|E

In 1906, club president Dr. Petřík was in England where he saw the famous Arsenal play with their red jerseys and decided to bring one set to Prague. At that time, he did not realise he was setting up one of the club's greatest traditions. Together with the red jerseys, Sparta players wear white shorts and black socks.|$|R
25|$|The Para Training School was {{established}} at the PAF Academy Risalpur in 2003. It is the second parachute school in Pakistan after the Pakistan Army Para School located at Peshawar. Before its establishment, PAF personnel were trained at the Pakistan Army Para School. The school conducts various basic and advanced courses, including free fall training. It also trains cadets to fly para motor gliders. The Special Service Wing of the PAF also receives parachute training at this school. After a rigorous physical test the top cadets are selected to do the paragliding and para-trooping courses. Paragliding involves wearing a parachute and after jumping from a height, glide and land. Cadets who successfully complete the paragliding course are entitled to wear the paragliding (PG) badge on their uniforms and they further {{get a chance to}} now fly para motor gliders which gets them <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> the PMG badge on their uniforms.|$|E
25|$|Makhaya Ntini {{was born}} in Mdingi, a small village in Cape Province which is near King William's Town (currently in Eastern Cape province). He was {{discovered}} by a Border Cricket Board development officer who was setting up a mini-cricket programme. Although Ntini was both too old and too big {{to participate in the}} programme, the officer, Raymond Booi noticed the bared-footed cowherd's enthusiasm and talent for bowling. He lent the 15-year-old Ntini a pair of plimsolls and arranged for him to participate in a net session in King William's Town. Ntini impressed Booi, who contacted the head of the development programme, Greg Hayes, and the pair placed Ntini in a junior cricket festival in Queenstown. For the festival, Hayes purchased Ntini his first pair of boots – but later had to give the young bowler instructions not <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> indoors, or when herding cattle.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the skirt of the frock coat varied during the Victorian era and Edwardian era {{according}} to fashion. The most conservative length became established as being to the knees but fashion conscious men would follow the latest trends <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> either longer or shorter. Similarly, {{the height of the}} waist– the point of maximal waist suppression– changed according to fashion. During its heyday, the frock coat was cut following the 19th century ideal of flattering the natural elegance of the naked figure, based on the ideals of Neoclassicism that admired the depiction of the idealised nude in Classical Greco-Roman sculpture. The elegance of the form of the frock coat derived from its hourglass shape with a closely cut waist which at times around the 1830s-40's was reinforced further with padding to round out the chest. A cut with an ideal hourglass silhouette was achievable because coats during this era were all made bespoke, individually cut to the exact measurements of the customer. The 19th century aesthetics of tailoring contrasted markedly to the modern style of cutting suits which involves a greater degree of drape (fullness), as established by the great early 20th century Savile Row tailor Frederick Scholte. Caution needs to be exercised by modern tailors trained to create the drape cut style of modern lounge suits to minimise drape– particularly around the waist– when cutting a historically accurate frock coat. Sometimes, modern lounge suit coats with an unusually long skirt are referred to by ready-to-wear makers as a 'frock coat' but these lack the waist seam, resulting in the fuller drape more typical of a modern overcoat or a lounge suit jacket. The silhouette of the historically accurate frock coat has the waist seam precisely tailored to permit the classical and elongating hourglass figure with the strong waist suppression.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the only}} {{standardized}} {{piece of the}} equipment has been the sweater (jersey), which has to be of identical design by the same company for all members of a team. Other elements merely have a number scheme, allowing individual players to select their own brand and model colored to match the uniform but not necessarily identical in appearance. Sticks and other equipment worn under the clothes have no requirements in terms of matching a team's colors; teams will sometimes provide players with team-brand undershirts or other under-clothing, but players are not required or limited <b>to</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
