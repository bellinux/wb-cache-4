5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

Crews, a national conservative activist, challenged McGovern's positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. McGovern derided his opponent's focus on social issues, saying, [...] "When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the first thing he thinks about is gay marriage. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how {{to make the world a}} more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about." [...] McGovern defeated Crews with 71 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sting in the Tail {{generally}} received positive reviews. Thom Jurek from AllMusic {{stated that}} [...] "as a farewell, Sting in the Tail is an album the Scorpions and their fans {{can be proud}} of". Scott Alisoglu from Blabbermouth.net said that the album is a [...] "very good representation of what makes the Scorpions a truly classic heavy metal band". Kevin Wierzbicki from antiMusic.com rated this album with {{three and a half}} stars commenting that [...] "Sting in the Tail is pretty much a typical Scorpions effort filled with well-performed but ultimately forgettable rockers". Two reviewers gave the album almost full score. Tony Antunovich from Metaleater.com gave the album A- stating that [...] "is a solid effort and focuses primarily on slightly toned-down Rock anthems performed in SCORPIONS style", while Aniruddh [...] "Andrew" [...] Bansal of Metal Assault nine and a half out of ten by saying that [...] "If this really is the last album they would ever record, I would say with a heavy heart that it's the perfect way to say goodbye to the fans" [...] Ruben Mosqueda from Sleaze Roxx gave a positive review to the album by saying that [...] "Sting in the Tail is a near perfect album and one hell of a way to wind up a career". Former drummer Herman Rarebell said [...] "I like the new album very much. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way people hear the Scorpions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
