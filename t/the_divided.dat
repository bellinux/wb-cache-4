5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed the completion of <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was {{subject to the same}} environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E

5|$|The {{dispute between}} the {{counties}} was resolved {{once and for all}} in 1848 when the Windsor Improvement Act 1848 decreed the dismantling of <b>the</b> <b>Divided</b> Bridge and the building of two new road bridges, Victoria Bridge slightly upstream, and Albert Bridge slightly downstream. Both new bridges opened in 1851. Once <b>the</b> <b>Divided</b> Bridge was demolished the old Windsor to Datchet road was rerouted over Victoria Bridge and the Berkshire side became part of the private grounds of Windsor Castle. This is the only case on the entire Thames where a main bridge crossing has completely disappeared.|$|E
5|$|A new {{alignment}} of M-99 highway was opened from the Ransom area north to Osseo in 1966; the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to {{end at the}} new highway near Osseo and M-99 supplanted M-34 from Osseo to Hillsdale. <b>The</b> <b>divided</b> highway section of M-99 was opened north of Eaton Rapids in 1979.|$|E

Datchet High Street which once continued on over the bridge to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of Freehold.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this portion}} of NY441 is {{surrounded}} by woodlands, it is actually located in a largely developed area of Penfield known locally as Panorama. The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the densely populated hamlet of Penfield.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1961, the US27 freeway through Isabella County was {{completed}} and <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway was upgraded to full freeway status. With this project completed, the connector between the freeway and Mission Street south of Mount Pleasant and the former routing along Mission in town was rechristened Bus. US27. A new divided highway connector on {{the north end of}} town was built to complete the business route. In 2002, when US127 replaced US27 north of Lansing, the Mount Pleasant business loop was given its current moniker to match.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> Continental <b>Divide</b> of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern part of <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>divide</b> is a {{topographic}} feature that separates Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of}} the park lies {{on the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>divide.</b> <b>The</b> origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>divide.</b> As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
5|$|Datchet Bridge, {{also known}} as <b>The</b> <b>Divided</b> Bridge, was a road bridge which crossed the River Thames at Datchet from 1706 until it was {{demolished}} in 1848. It was situated on the reach between Old Windsor Lock and Romney Lock and linked Windsor on the Berkshire bank to Datchet on the Buckinghamshire side. The bridge replaced a ferry service which had operated at the site {{since at least the}} middle of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|For {{the length}} of this concurrency, it is a divided four lane {{expressway}} with no left turns, known as right-in/right-out (RIRO). At Enterprise Hill, Highway 35 exits <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway (which continues as Highway 115 east to Peterborough) and proceeds north as a two lane road. The highway crosses the Oak Ridges Moraine as it passes into the City of Kawartha Lakes.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, MD 416 was {{designated}} concurrent with MD 2 between Solomons and Sunderland. In 1965, the MD 416 concurrency {{was replaced by}} an overlap with MD 4. Also, MD 2 was shifted to a new alignment between Sunderland and Owings, with the former route becoming MD 765. MD 2/MD 4 was widened to a divided highway between Huntingtown and the split in Sunderland in 1967. <b>The</b> <b>divided</b> highway was extended to south of Huntingtown in 1969, bypassing Huntingtown to the east. The former alignment through the community became MD 524. In 1970, MD 2/MD 4 became a divided highway between Prince Frederick and south of Huntingtown. In January 1978, MD 4 was rerouted north of Solomons onto the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge over the Patuxent River. In 1979, <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway was extended south from Prince Frederick to Port Republic. MD 2/MD 4 was shifted west to a new divided highway between south of St. Leonard to Port Republic in 1981, with the former two-lane routing designated part of MD 765. In 1987, MD 2/MD 4 between Solomons and south of St. Leonard was shifted to a new divided highway. The bypassed alignment through Lusby and Solomons became another part of MD 765.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Subcontinental <b>Divide</b> is an altitudinal {{divide in}} southeastern Wisconsin running {{north to south}} along the Waukesha County/Milwaukee County border (mirroring Sunnyslope Rd. in New Berlin, WI). It is a {{watershed}} between two drainage basins. Water falling {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> <b>divide</b> flows to <b>the</b> east towards Lake Michigan and water falling to the west of <b>the</b> <b>divide</b> flows west towards the Mississippi River, eventually flowing into the Gulf of Mexico. Although 62 percent of the area's population lives on the eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>divide,</b> due to <b>the</b> projected growth west of <b>the</b> <b>divide,</b> water shortages west of <b>the</b> <b>divide</b> have become a growing concern due to radium contamination in the area's aquifers. [...] To overcome the water shortage problems posed by <b>the</b> subcontinental <b>divide,</b> New Berlin has reached an agreement with the City of Milwaukee to expand their water purchases and receive safe drinking water from Lake Michigan, on the provision as agreed upon by the Great Lakes Compact, that the treated water be returned to the Great Lakes Basin.|$|R

5|$|NY326 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and extended from the village of Union Springs to the city of Auburn. The route initially followed Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the hamlet of Oakwood to Auburn, where it ended at an intersection with NY34 (South Street) in downtown Auburn. A divided highway was built west of Auburn , connecting the overlapping routes of US20 and NY5 to NY326. US20 and NY5 were rerouted to follow the new highway south to NY326, and all three routes continued east into downtown on Genesee Street. By 1977, US20 and NY5 were realigned once again to follow a new arterial leading from the north end of <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway eastward into downtown. NY326, meanwhile, was realigned to follow <b>the</b> <b>divided</b> highway north to US20 and NY5.|$|E
5|$|NY441 was {{originally}} routed on Penfield Road between Brighton and Penfield {{when it was}} assigned in 1949. It remained on Penfield Road through Penfield and into Wayne County to Marion, where the highway ended at NY21. The entirety of this routing had previously been part of NY33, which was truncated westward to downtown Rochester as part of NY441's assignment. NY441 was cut back to NY350 in Walworth by 1970. <b>The</b> <b>divided</b> highway that now carries NY441 through Brighton and western Penfield was constructed during the late 1960s and opened as a realignment of NY441 by 1971.|$|E
