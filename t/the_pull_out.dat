At the conference the Soviets {{expressed}} frustration that the Western Allies had not yet opened a second front against Germany in Western Europe. In Tehran, the Allies also considered the political status of Iran.

2500|$|Khan {{publicly}} {{demanded a}} Pakistani apology towards the Bangladeshi {{people for the}} atrocities committed in 1971, He called the 1971 operation a [...] "blunder" [...] and likened it to today's treatment of Pashtuns {{in the war on}} terror. However, he repeatedly criticized the war crimes trials in Bangladesh in favor of the convicts, perpetuating the culture of genocide denial on the part of Pakistan. Khan is often mocked as [...] "Taliban Khan" [...] because of his pacifist stance regarding the war in North-West Pakistan. He believes in negotiations with Taliban and <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> of the Pakistan Army from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). He is against US drone strikes and plans to disengage Pakistan from the US-led war on terror. Khan also opposes almost all military operations, including the Siege of Lal Masjid.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{explored}} the diameter selectivity of dynamic self-assembly for the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) encapsulation in double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs) via {{molecular dynamics simulation}} method. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> process {{was carried out by}} steered molecular dynamics simulations. Considering pi-pi stacking and solvent accessibility together, base-CNT binding should be strongest on a graphene sheet and weakest on the inner CNT surface. When <b>pulling</b> <b>the</b> ssDNA <b>out</b> of the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT), the force exhibits characteristic fluctuations around a plateau about 300 pN. Each fluctuation force pulse to pull ssDNA corresponds to the exit of one base. In addition, the solvents used for the system are also of significant interest. Water does {{play an important role in}} encapsulation process but doesn't in <b>the</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> process...|$|R

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> {{resistance}} of hawthorn and oak roots are affected by intra species differences, inter-species variations and root size (diameter) in a similar as way as root tensile strength varies (as measured in the laboratory). In <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> test the applied force acting on the root acts across a larger root area, which involves multiple branches, longer lengths) than the short (approximately 150mm) length of root used in tensile strength tests. In pull out test the root is likely to fail at weak points such as branching points, nodes or damaged areas.|$|E

Among the modern machine guns using this system are the PK family, where its use is mandated by {{the rim of the}} 7.62×54mmR cartridge, which makes it all but impossible to eject the round forward from the belt.|$|E

5000|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} the electric field, and adhesion between the beam and drain cause the device to [...] "pull out" [...] and lose connection at a lower voltage than the voltage at which it pulls in. This hysteresis effect means there is a voltage between the pull in voltage, and <b>the</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> voltage that will not change {{the state of the}} relay, no matter what its initial state is. This property is very useful in applications where information needs to be stored in the circuit, such as in static random-access memory.|$|E
