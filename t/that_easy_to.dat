Julie warns her that it's not <b>that</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> stop loving someone, explaining that she'll always love Steve, singing a few lines of [...] "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man". Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard [...] "colored folks" [...] sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.|$|E
500|$|Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, was {{tasked with}} finding [...] "normal-looking {{suburban}} people" [...] for the cast.

We've used {{so many people}} {{over the years that}} it's gotten harder and harder to find them. Several of the individuals cast had previously played parts in [...] "obscure genre films": Michelle Joyner first appeared in the 1990 anthology film Grim Prairie Tales, Gina Mastrogiacomo first was noted in her 1989 movie Alien Space Avenger, John Mese had a part in the 1995 movie Night of the Scarecrow, and finally, Wendy Schaal had appeared in the [...] 1985 film Creature.|$|E

500|$|Head writer Maria Arena Bell {{dedicated}} the 4th of July episode to Sharon, {{stating that}} the episode would [...] "shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her {{to be in this}} situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [...] self-esteem." [...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say she did what she thought she had to do. Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never <b>that</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> walk away from the people you love".|$|E
500|$|Each playable {{character}} in the game {{has the ability to}} equip items. Weapons in the game, unlike its predecessors, are gained in levels. Some items are only found in certain stages, but is only obtainable if completing a goal. Sometimes the goal may be very simple, but some may be not <b>that</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> figure out how to obtain the certain item. By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated. This experience is allocated {{at the end of the}} level and allows the player to increase their attributes or obtain new forms. Each playable officer has 9 levels to achieve with their standard weapon, while a 10th level is accessible through special in-game requirements, and on the [...] "Hard" [...] difficulty, which is found to be frustrating like most games, the harder the difficulty the more eager you gain. Items can have a number of effects on the player such as increasing attack power, defense, and movement speed. You can also retrieve your health level to avoid getting killed and having [...] "Game Over" [...] by obtaining [...] "Chinese Meatbuns" [...] that at first, look like onions like in any other game in the so far successful Dynasty Warriors franchise. You can also obtain item boost that increase a certain skill by 2 for limited time only. You can also get packs of wine and packs of Chinese Meatbuns in certain stages in certain locations during gameplay. As said above, special items can also be unlocked by completing objectives during gameplay. Special items can grant the player a statistics boost, a unique ability or skill, or even a ride-able mount such as an Elephant or Horse.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season, however, {{was another}} championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per {{game in the}} regular season, and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up {{a meeting with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship. Duncan proclaimed that that championship was [...] "the best" [...] of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played [...] "sub-par" [...] and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten. His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the [...] "Tim Duncan era", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: [...] "Tim is the common denominator. He's [...] a different cast around him [...] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. [...] But he is <b>that</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in." [...] Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: [...] " [...] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He just happens {{to be one of the}} greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, {{following}} his major successes the previous year, Humperdinck reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart with [...] "A Man Without Love", and the {{album of the}} same name climbed to No. 3. Another single, [...] "Les Bicyclettes de Belsize", was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom and reached the top 40 in the United States. By the end of the decade, Humperdinck's expanding roster of songs also included [...] "Am I <b>That</b> <b>Easy</b> <b>to</b> Forget", [...] "The Way It Used to Be", [...] "I'm a Better Man (For Having Loved You)" [...] (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David) and [...] "Winter World of Love". He supplemented these big-selling singles with a number of equally successful albums. These albums formed the bedrock of his fame, and include Release Me, The Last Waltz, A Man Without Love and Engelbert Humperdinck.|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 2011, Ichiro {{broke the}} Seattle Mariners' all-time career hits record with his 2,248th {{hit in the}} 9th inning versus the Oakland Athletics, {{overtaking}} the team's previous leader Edgar Martínez. 2011 {{marked the first time}} in Ichiro's 11 seasons that he failed to make the all star team. He batted under [...]300 (.277) before the all star break {{for the first time in}} his career. On July 10, manager Eric Wedge did not start Ichiro, ending his then-major league-best active streak of 255 consecutive starts. Ichiro followed with an 11-game hitting streak, but Wedge noted [...] "it's not <b>that</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> give that guy a day off" [...] due to Ichiro's iconic stature. On August 22, Ichiro hit his 35th career leadoff homer, tying him for 6th place with Bobby Bonds. Ichiro finished the season batting a career-low [...]272 with 184hits, the first time in his 11-year MLB career he did not record 200hits.

2500|$|From {{within the}} UK, few country musicians {{achieved}} widespread mainstream success. Tom Jones, {{by this point}} {{near the end of}} his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bee Gees had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists ("Rest Your Love on Me") and a major hit as songwriters ("Islands in the Stream"). Singer Engelbert Humperdinck, while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with [...] "After the Lovin'," [...] achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his faithful covers of Nashville country ballads such as [...] "Release Me," [...] "Am I <b>That</b> <b>Easy</b> <b>to</b> Forget" [...] and [...] "There Goes My Everything." [...] The songwriting tandem of Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{a widely}} held opinion that {{dyslexia}} is associated with remarkably artistic creativity." [...] This leads to {{us to look at}} art schools {{to see if there are}} high numbers of people who have dyslexia. The answer is yes, there is an unusually high correlation between people with dyslexia and art students. The question should be why? [...] There are speculations that dyslexics have differing brain structures and functions. There tends to be a lack of objective studies that confirm the art and dyslexia relationship. The Wolff and Lundberg article implies that it isn't <b>that</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get into art school; that people with dyslexia earn their entrance into the art schools on artistic merit, as an easy way out of conventional academics. Corlu, Özcan, and Korkmazlar suggest that further research is a valid research concern. There are studies that seemingly coincide with the concept that people with dyslexia see the world differently. There seems to be evidence that dyslexics have a superior level of visuospatial skill. Gross and Bornstein think that dyslexia might be due to a difficulty in treating mirror images as the same stimulus, when taking into consideration words that are commonly switched, such as god and dog, no and on, and saw and was.|$|E
