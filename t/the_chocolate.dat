5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory in February 2000, Warner Bros. announced their intention of marketing the film with a Broadway theatre musical after release. The studio reiterated their interest in May 2003, however, the idea was postponed by the time filming began in June 2004. The main tie-in for Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory focused on The Willy Wonka Candy Company, a division of Nestlé. A small range of Wonka Bars were launched, utilizing their prominence in the film. The release of Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory also rekindled public interest in Roald Dahl's 1964 book, and appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list from July 3 to October 23, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory {{started on}} June 21, 2004 at Pinewood Studios in England. Director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman found filming somewhat difficult {{because they were}} simultaneously working on Corpse Bride. The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989). The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras. <b>The</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work {{four and a half}} hours a day, filming for Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} and declined the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{immediately}} brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory {{represents the}} first time since The Nightmare Before Christmas that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Development {{for another}} {{adaptation}} of Charlie and <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory (filmed previously as Willy Wonka & <b>the</b> <b>Chocolate</b> Factory in 1971) began in 1991, {{which resulted in}} Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while actors Bill Murray, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Adam Sandler, and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent growth of {{interest}} in determining whether sound (specifically music and soundscapes) can enhance not only the basic taste attributes associated with food and beverage items (such as sweetness, bitterness, sourness, etc.), but also other important components of the tasting experience, such as, for instance, crunchiness, creaminess, and/or carbonation. In the present study, participants evaluated the perceived creaminess of chocolate. Two contrasting soundtracks were produced with such texture-correspondences in mind, and validated {{by means of a}} pre-test. The participants tasted <b>the</b> same <b>chocolate</b> twice (without knowing that <b>the</b> <b>chocolates</b> were identical), each time listening to one of the soundtracks. The ‘creamy’ soundtrack enhanced the perceived creaminess and sweetness of <b>the</b> <b>chocolates,</b> as compared to the ratings given while listening to the ‘rough’ soundtrack. Moreover, while the participants preferred the creamy soundtrack, this difference did not appear to affect their overall enjoyment of <b>the</b> <b>chocolates.</b> Interestingly, and in contrast with previous similar studies, these results demonstrate that in certain cases, sounds can have a perceptual effect on gustatory food attributes without necessarily altering the hedonic experience. status: publishe...|$|R
