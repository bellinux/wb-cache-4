Gombau further reinforced his dogmatic approach by bringing in FC Barcelona legend Guillermo Amor as the club's technical director.

Gombau's United won the inaugural FFA Cup with a 1–0 win against Perth Glory. Gombau left the club in July 2015 to take up a youth coaching role in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) {{the only}} legally {{recognized}} party of Bangladesh founded on 7 June 1975 following the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of Bangladesh. Mujib's government soon began encountering increased dissatisfaction and unrest. His programs of nationalization and industrial socialism suffered {{from lack of}} trained personnel, inefficiency, rampant corruption, and poor leadership. Mujib focused almost entirely on national issues and thus neglected local issues and government. The party and central government exercised full control and democracy was weakened, with virtually no elections organized at <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>roots</b> or local levels. Political opposition included communists as well as Islamic fundamentalists, who were angered by the declaration of a secular state. Mujib was criticized for nepotism in appointing family members to important positions. A famine in 1974 further intensified the food crisis, and devastated agriculture– the mainstay of the economy. Intense criticism of Mujib arose over the lack of political leadership, a flawed pricing policy, and rising inflation amidst heavy losses suffered by the nationalized industries. Mujib's ambitious social programs performed poorly, owing to scarcity of resources, funds, and personnel, and caused unrest amongst the masses.|$|E

His rumpled suits, country-style haircut, and Indiana twang were reminiscent of ordinary midwesterners, which led to some derision as the efforts to nominate him became more obvious.

500|$|One {{of three}} presidential {{candidates}} at the December 1839 Whig National Convention, Harrison gained the nomination over Henry Clay and General Winfield Scott {{on the fifth}} ballot. At home, far from the convention {{in an era of}} primitive communications, Harrison played no part in the selection of Tyler as running mate. After the convention, a Democratic paper in Baltimore suggested that if offered a pension and some hard cider to drink in a log cabin, Harrison would turn aside from his campaign. The Whigs adopted the cabin and cider as emblems, both of which were commonly seen (and, in the case of cider, drunk) at their rallies, and became symbolic of the party's connection with <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>roots.</b> [...] Harrison rallies grew to unprecedented size, and the candidate made speeches to some of them, breaking the usual custom that the office should seek the man and presidential hopefuls should not campaign.|$|E

Critic William Ruhlmann has argued that {{in the wake of}} [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the influence of The Byrds could be heard in recordings by a number of other Los Angeles-based acts, including The Turtles, The Leaves, Barry McGuire, and Sonny & Cher. In addition, author and music historian Richie Unterberger sees the influence of The Byrds in recordings by The Lovin' Spoonful, The Mamas & the Papas, Simon & Garfunkel, and Love, while author John Einarson has noted that both <b>The</b> <b>Grass</b> <b>Roots</b> and We Five enjoyed commercial success by emulating The Byrds' folk rock sound. Furthermore, a number of commentators, including Richie Unterberger, Scott Plangenhoef, and Ian MacDonald have noted that by late 1965, The Beatles themselves were assimilating the sound of folk rock, and in particular The Byrds, into the material found on their Rubber Soul album, most notably on the songs [...] "Nowhere Man" [...] and [...] "If I Needed Someone".|$|E
500|$|The Wrecking Crew {{continued}} to be in demand in the early 1970s, even enjoying several hits, {{but by the end}} of 1973 they began to experience a downturn in bookings, as a series of changes in the recording industry began to take hold. [...] Unlike earlier bands such as the Monkees and <b>the</b> <b>Grass</b> <b>Roots,</b> who often utilized the Wrecking Crew for backing tracks, and perhaps because of it, rock groups in the early 1970s began having it stipulated in their recording contracts that they be allowed to play their own instruments on records. [...] By the early 1970s, younger session players such as Larry Carlton, Andrew Gold, Danny Kortchmar, Waddy Wachtel, Russ Kunkel, Jeff Porcaro, Leland Sklar, and Jim Keltner arrived with a more contemporary sound well-suited to the changing musical tastes of the unfolding decade. [...] By the mid-1970s, particularly with the arrival of 16-track and 24-track tape recording machines and automated large-format multi-channel consoles, advances in recording technology made it viable for instruments to be recorded, often close-miked, onto separate tracks individually, reducing the need to hire ensembles to play live in the studio. [...] Synthesizers were brought in which could approximate the sound of practically any instrument and, eventually, drum machines would become the norm, which could be specially programmed to keep beats in place of a drummer or be used for click tracks played in musicians' headphones, making it easier to overdub or re-record any part in-synch and achieve a more uniform and consistent tempo. [...] By the mid-1970s many of the Wrecking Crew's members scattered and drifted into different spheres. [...] Though the unit did a brief, but ill-fated reunion session with Phil Spector in 1992, and more recently backed Glen Campbell in his song [...] "I'm Not Gonna Miss You" [...] taken from the soundtrack of the 2015 documentary , they have spent most of the last four decades engaged in separate projects.|$|E
