5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> {{that early}} Christianity {{influenced}} Mingulay (for example the nearby islands of Pabbay and Berneray both have cross-inscribed slabs) but no direct evidence {{has yet been}} found. From circa 871 onwards Viking raids on the Outer Hebrides gathered pace but similarly the Viking graves found on Berneray and Vatersay are not replicated on Mingulay and whilst there are no definite indications of Norse settlement, their presence on the island is confirmed by the many features they named.|$|E
5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived {{in the area where}} they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
5|$|Earl Henry was {{not present}} at the battle, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that he participated in the rebellion. After a short imprisonment, he was pardoned, and in June 1404 he {{delivered}} his grandson into the king's custody at Doncaster. By May 1405, however, the earl was involved in another rebellion. His plans failed, and {{he was forced to}} flee to Scotland, taking his grandson with him. The following years were marked by an itinerant life and further plotting, while the young Henry remained in the custody of the Duke of Albany. On 19 February 1408, the first earl of Northumberland was killed in the Battle of Bramham Moor, leaving the young Henry Percy as heir apparent to the earldom. Henry remained in Scotland until the accession of Henry V in 1413, when he tried to claim his grandfather's title. His cause was aided by the king's aunt, Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, who arranged his marriage to her daughter Eleanor. It was in Henry V's interest to reconcile with the Percys, with their vast network in the north of England; in 1416 Henry Percy was created Earl of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
25|$|While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that ashtâpada is the gameboard of 8×8 squares, {{the double}} meaning of chaturanga, as the four-folded army, may be controversial. There is a {{probability}} that the ancestor of chess was mentioned there.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> {{that the}} post-1950s era {{witnessed}} an awakening of Quebecers' self-identity.

25|$|These early pieces, K. 1–5, were {{recorded}} in the Nannerl Notenbuch. There is some scholarly debate about whether Mozart was {{four or five years}} old when he created his first musical compositions, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that Mozart composed his first three pieces of music within a few weeks of each other: K. 1a, 1b, and 1c.|$|E
25|$|Even though Gadamer's {{interpretation}} of Heidegger has been questioned, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a gestalt formation, {{not merely a}} series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.|$|E

25|$|Dyer's {{downfall}} {{came when}} the bagged corpse of an infant was discovered in the Thames, with evidence leading to her.

At the time of her death, a handful of murders were attributed to her, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> she was responsible for many more similar deaths—possibly 400 or more.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> {{that the}} history of {{transport}} communications through Harringay had a significant effect on its shape today. In Roman times, a great roadway through the area to the north was established. This roadway endured as a great communication passage to the north and brought much activity through the heart of the area. It also acted as the rough dividing line for land ownership, identifying Harringay’s position on the edge of manorial and subsequently borough boundaries.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{reliable}} worldwide database listing all cave diving fatalities. Such fractional statistics as are available, however, suggest {{that very few}} divers have ever died while following accepted protocols and while using equipment configurations recognized as acceptable by the cave diving community. In the very rare cases of exceptions to this rule there have typically been unusual circumstances. Much {{the same can be}} said for other modes and applications of diving. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that competence, good preparation and appropriate equipment reduce the risk of all hazardous activities.|$|E

25|$|These {{delays and}} the lack of funding slowed the project. In Germany, Hans von Ohain had started work on a {{prototype}} in 1935, and had by this point passed the prototype stage and was building the world's first flyable Jet aircraft, the Heinkel HeS 3. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that Whittle's efforts would have been at the same level or even more advanced had the Air Ministry taken a greater interest in the design. When war broke out in September 1939, Power Jets had a payroll of only 10 and Griffith's operations at the RAE and Metropolitan-Vickers were similarly small.|$|E
25|$|However, {{collaboration}} {{is not the}} whole story. While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that there were strong antisemitic feelings in Belgium, after November 1942, the German roundups became less successful as large-scale rescue operations were carried out by ordinary Belgians. This resulted in the survival of about 25,000 Jews from Belgium. Unlike other states, which were immediately annexed, Belgium was initially placed under German military administration, which the Belgian authorities exploited by refusing to carry {{out some of the}} Nazi directives against the Jews. Roughly 60 percent of Belgium's Jews, who were there {{at the start of the}} war, survived the Final Solution.|$|E
25|$|Van Voorst {{states that}} {{although}} {{the question of who}} was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of Sanhedrin 43a (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth. Christopher M. Tuckett states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.|$|E
60|$|Sam {{knew that}} the men were in no humor to be trifled with, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> but the {{strangling}} would follow unless he obeyed.

40|$|Forty {{years ago}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> {{in the minds}} of socialists that {{planning}} was way of the future.

5000|$|When the {{war began}} that fateful summer, the general populace was caught {{completely}} off guard. It arrived in Europe like a [...] "peal of thunder reverberating in a clear sky."

25|$|The {{seaside town}} {{has also been}} the {{backdrop}} for artists and philosophers such a Ludwig Wittgenstein who frequented the town for its beaches and vivid sunsets as lighting conditions here are excellent in particular during winter and summer months. Also the surrounding countryside and valley stretching back {{to the village of}} Avoca along the Avoca river is calming, leaving one with a sense of well-being, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> then as to why it is popular in art and poetry. Laterly Avoca village and the surrounding area were popularised in the T.V. show Ballykissangel, drawing many visitors from abroad who come to see where the show was filmed.|$|E
25|$|After just 100 {{hours of}} ground combat, {{and with all}} of Kuwait and much of {{southern}} Iraq under coalition control, US President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened {{the scope of the}} conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.|$|E
25|$|It should however {{be noted}} that the {{disadvantages}} of such terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through such terrain. During the Battle of France, the German blitzkrieg-style attack on France went through the Ardennes. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that the hilly, heavily wooded Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the bulk of the German armoured units. However, precisely because the French thought the Ardennes unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the Wehrmacht. The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> clear ideological {{differences}} {{between those who}} continued on as symbolists {{and those who have}} been called [...] "dissidents" [...] for remaining in the Decadent Movement.

50|$|Evidence {{was given}} about Rowles' {{behaviour}} and {{his knowledge of}} the fictional murder method. Evidence was also presented to the court about various lies Rowles had told about his movements. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> that Rowles had committed three murders and the jury returned a guilty verdict in only two hours. Rowles was hanged for murder, at Fremantle Prison, on 13 June 1931.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, Royal Air Force Bomber Command {{was drawing}} up plans for {{dispersal}} of their {{aircraft in the}} event of air raids on its stations.
