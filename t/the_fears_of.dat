In 2006, Malcolm Glazer's other two sons, Kevin and Edward, and his daughter, Darcie, were appointed to the Manchester United board as non-executive directors.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced beginning in 1906, after the lumberman had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> anglers, their diet is only 5percent trout.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. <b>The</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
50|$|Lesson 2 Self-Confidence {{will help}} you master <b>the</b> six basic <b>fears</b> with which every person is cursed: <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Poverty, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Ill Health, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Old Age, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Criticism, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Loss of Love <b>of</b> Someone, and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Death. It will teach you the {{difference}} between egotism and real self-confidence which is based upon definite, usable knowledge.|$|R

50|$|It {{seeks to}} create the {{situation}} in which all our people shall be free from <b>fear,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oppression of one national group by another, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disempowerment of one social echelon by another, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of state power to deny anybody their fundamental human rights and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> tyranny.|$|R
5|$|St Vincent's gaze {{passed over}} {{every aspect of}} the Navy from the Sea Fencibles to the Navy Hospitals. The earl {{attempted}} to disband the Sea Fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. Doctor Baird, St Vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all Hospitals.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia General Assembly {{voted in}} February 1846 {{to accept the}} return of Alexandria and on July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the {{territory}} that had been ceded by Virginia. Therefore, the District's current area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland. Confirming <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> {{terrorism}} {{received an}} extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> {{appearing}} incompetent as delineated by White, Goffman and Adler. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing incompetent is {{an aspect of}} competence that may threaten self-esteem. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing incompetent can purportedly be measured by <b>the</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Appearing Incompetent Scale (FAIS). It was found that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing incompetent correlated positively with self-estimated IQ, but correlated negatively with obtained IQ. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing incompetent had no significant relationship to GPA. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing incompetent in participants who over-estimated their IQs {{did not differ significantly}} from <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing incompetent in participants who under-estimated their IQs. There was also {{no significant difference between the}} mean self-estimated IQ and the mean obtained IQ. Out of a total of 68 participants 44 % accurately estimated their IQs, 22 % over-estimated their IQs and 34 % under-estimated their IQs...|$|R
5000|$|The Jonah {{complex is}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> success which {{prevents}} self-actualization, or {{the realization of}} one's potential. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> one's own greatness, the evasion of one's destiny, or the avoidance of exercising one's talents. As <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> achieving a personal worst may serve to motivate personal growth, likewise <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> achieving a personal best may hinder achievement.|$|R
50|$|Pulp {{novels in}} the 1950s were mass-produced to {{specifically}} {{cash in on}} <b>the</b> growing <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> youth that was spreading throughout society. Ironically, {{it has also been}} said that popular media's effects on young people are not as powerful as <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> youth, which drives <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> technology and in turn perpetuates <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> youth.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{of a new}} four-lane {{bridge across}} the Raritan River (now the John A. Lynch Memorial Bridge) began in the 1960s, but in 1970, when the {{environment}} impact laws came out, construction froze with only three massive piers standing out of the river. Outside of the bridge, there was significant controversy over the abandoned Delaware and Raritan Canal heading through New Brunswick. The new freeway was to supplant the former canal and its thirteenth lock in New Brunswick, abandoned in 1932. The environmentalists and the historic preservationists opposed the freeway extension because of <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> losing the canal, while companies like Johnson & Johnson supported the new highway for redeveloping New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Cousse's message {{confirmed}} <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> Faisal's cabinet that Gouraud {{was intent}} on taking over Syria by force. The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal {{to the international community}} to end the French advance. On 23 July, Al-'Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers, which was divided into northern, central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units. French forces launched their offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al-Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July, at 5:00, while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al-Qarn.|$|E
5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} plan, {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. <b>The</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E
50|$|Other {{conditions}} <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> or aversion {{associated with}} age groups {{have their own}} names, particularly: paedophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> infants and children; ephebiphobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> youth, sometimes {{also referred to as}} an irrational <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> adolescents or a prejudice against teenagers; and gerontophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> elderly people.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{fear that}} is unlike all other fears. It has a special, clammy chill, a deadly gift for inspiring deeper, darker dread. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> unentered rooms, of bends in lonely roads. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phone call {{in the middle of}} the night, of the {{stranger}} you recognize, perhaps from a nightmare. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unexpected, the unfamiliar. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of...</b> <b>THE</b> UNKNOWN.|$|R
5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> his family that a childhood head injury {{caused by a}} dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: {{it was the fact}} of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken bone in his hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This is seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|In August 1870, Seward {{embarked}} on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was Olive Risley, {{daughter of a}} Treasury Department official, to whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where they walked on the Great Wall. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus {{putting an end to}} gossip and <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.|$|E
60|$|Solomon {{does not}} say, To {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord {{is the beginning}} of wisdom, but simply <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord {{is the beginning of}} it. But the end of wisdom, he says, is not merely to <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> Lord, but to understand <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord.|$|R
50|$|Some {{possible}} explanations of gephyrophobia may be <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> driving off <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> {{a gust of}} wind taking one off <b>the</b> bridge, a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural integrity of the bridges itself, or <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that <b>the</b> bridge will collapse if they try to cross it. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> overlaps with acrophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> heights, as gephyrophobia tends to be exacerbated in tall bridges vs. ones close to the water/ground beneath.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling (FOF), also {{referred}} to as basophobia (or basiphobia), is a natural fear and is typical of most humans and mammals, in varying degrees of extremity. It differs from acrophobia (<b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> heights), although <b>the</b> two <b>fears</b> are closely related. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling encompasses <b>the</b> anxieties accompanying the sensation and the possibly dangerous effects of falling, as opposed to the heights themselves. Those who have little <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling may be said to have a head for heights. Basophobia is sometimes associated with astasia-abasia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> walking/standing erect.|$|R
5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. <b>The</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
500|$|Parsons {{identified}} four {{obstacles that}} prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, {{all of which}} he connected with fear: <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> incompetence, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> others, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> hurting others, and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> insecurity.

5|$|The castle was {{expanded}} in the 1680s by Sir Bernard de Gomme and, {{after a period}} of neglect in the 18th century, was redesigned again in 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars. After a brief period of use as a military prison in the 1840s, the fortification {{was expanded}} in the 1850s and 1860s with additional gun batteries on the east and west sides. The defences were upgraded throughout the century due to <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> a French invasion and formed part of the plan for defending Portsmouth during the First World War. In the interwar years some of the fortifications were stood down, but the castle saw service again in the Second World War, when it was involved in Operation Grasp, the seizure of French naval vessels in Portsmouth harbour. In 1960, Southsea Castle, by now obsolete, was sold to Portsmouth City Council. It was restored to its pre-1850 appearance and opened as a tourist attraction, receiving over 90,000 visitors from 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|Although the Russians {{were quick}} {{to come to the}} aid of the British, the Anglo-Russian {{relationship}} was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long-standing history of competition. Just decades before the mutiny of 1915, Russia and Britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry. Spurred by the last tsar's Asiatic Mission and his visit to South East Asia as part of his world tour of 1891, the Russian government appointed its first ethnic-Russian Consul, V. Vyvodtsev, to Singapore as early as 1890. The Russian presence in Southeast Asia during the last quarter of the 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in China but also to carefully observe the designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in the region, foremost among them being the British empire. Anglo-Russian relationship took a turn for the worst during the latter half of the 19th century when both Britain and Russia were locked in competition for Afghanistan and Persia as well as when Britain halted Russian advancement into the Balkans and Turkey. Britain’s alignment with Japan as ally worsened Anglo-Russian relationship with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. This history of suspicion and rivalry explains why Rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 February expressing his reservations at placing the Orel and its accompanying men and guns under the command of the British military in Singapore. Eventually the French admiral was able to assuage <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> Rospopov and assured him that Russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen Anglo-Russian relation. When the mutiny was finally quelled, the Russian captain Vinokurov reportedly remarked to the British Governor to Singapore that the Russian assistance in suppressing the mutiny ‘’would unite the two countries better than any treaty’’.|$|E
5|$|President Lincoln {{called a}} special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special {{elections}} in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate, but he finally consented to run in late May. He was elected over secessionist candidate William E. Simms; in all, nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election. Upon taking his seat, {{he was assigned to}} the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On July 10, 1861, he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky's neutrality; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions. In order to calm <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> border state citizens concerned about the Union's objectives in the war, he introduced the Crittenden–Johnson Resolution, which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated that the object of the war was not the subjugation of those states, but the defense of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union. When those ends were achieved, the resolution stated, the war should cease. Kentucky Representative Henry C. Burnett asked that the question be divided. Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from Wisconsin's John F. Potter and Ohio's Albert G. Riddle. In the Senate, the resolution passed 30–5, with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority. In December 1861 the House refused, by a vote of 76–65, to reaffirm the resolution.|$|E
