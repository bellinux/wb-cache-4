The couple took great personal risks to obtain intelligence about Japanese spies and troop movements and pass it to the resistance.

In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan. Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century. It included the Turkification of last names, change of animal names, change {{of the names of}} Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E

He had infected the grain with a virus that becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually prevents the organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{organizational}} context, {{learning how to}} unlearn is vital because what we assume to be true has merged into our identity. We refer to <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual as a “mindset.” We refer to <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organizational group as a “culture.” Action learners learn how to question, probe and separate from, both kinds of identity—i.e., their “individual” selves and their “social” selves.

5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. <b>The</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia gracilis), which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E
5|$|Set reveals to the Resistance {{that the}} Nazis' {{discovery}} {{of one of}} the Da'at Yichud caches, which included advanced technology centuries ahead of its time, is what allowed Germany to surpass the Allies in military might and ultimately win the war. Set agrees to assist the Resistance by revealing the location of one such cache, but states that the Resistance requires a U-boat to access it. Blazkowicz obtains a U-boat, but discovers that it is the flagship of the Nazis' submarine fleet, and is equipped with a cannon designed to fire nuclear warheads, which requires codes from the Nazi lunar research facility to operate. Blazkowicz uses the technology found in the Da'at Yichud cache, namely the Spindly Torque—a sphere that destroys the super-concrete—to steal <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Nazi Lunar scientist and infiltrate the Lunar Base. He succeeds at obtaining the codes, but upon returning to earth, he discovers that Deathshead has mounted an assault on the Resistance base, capturing some of the members.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> is {{investigated}} through Aristotle and Hegel as {{supporters of}} two different ontological conceptions: pluralism of substances and relational holism. Through Aristotle, I examine both the thesis according to which <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object is constituted by its properties and the difficulties which this thesis encounters (e. g., those raised by Max Black). Aristotle easily defines <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> in species, in genus, and in number; some problems arise regarding <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> individuals: for these, {{it is not enough}} to indicate the definition and the proper qualities, but matter is needed. Matter cannot, however, be a criterion for identifying duplicate objects: in this case, it plays at most the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> "weak individuator" A weak individuator involves relations with other entities. The use of relations in determining <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity is extensively treated by Hegel, according to whom, in order to define <b>the</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object <b>a</b> multiplicity <b>of</b> particular objects is required and, therefore, relations among entities. I conclude by proposing <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> the object understood not as an independent, separate, and autonomous item, but as <b>a</b> portion <b>of</b> the world, which is given in a phenomenological context and identifies a dialectical context...|$|R
