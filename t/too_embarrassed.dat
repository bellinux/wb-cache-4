5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> {{to examine the}} teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E

25|$|Louis {{was under}} no {{delusion}} {{about the state}} of his boxing skills, yet he was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213½, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one could see that they were poor.|$|E

25|$|Many {{respondents}} who {{never used the}} library cited embarrassment or {{lack of knowledge about}} available information as reasons. Even those that did frequent the library often said that they were <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from those who did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was needed to address these perceptions. She also found that those {{respondents who}} regularly used a college or university library had a more positive experience finding needed information than those who used only the public library.|$|E
25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} the Dorchester {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to tell his mother about the injury and hoped it would go away, but it worsened {{to the point where he}} could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing his toe, and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may never walk again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> even to ask me for help.|$|E

40|$|Although {{breast-feeding}} receives {{strong support}} from physicians, recent focus groups conducted for Health Canada found that it still faces roadblocks because some new mothers find it <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> In some cases, their male partners oppose breast-feeding. The solution {{appears to be more}} and better education provided very early in pregnancy. There is also a need to "spell out explicitly" the role male partners can play in supporting breast-feeding...|$|R
500|$|The first Tchaikovsky opera {{to survive}} intact, The Oprichnik, premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky's part-finished {{libretto}}. [...] Tchaikovsky, <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> {{to ask for}} another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modelling his dramatic technique on that of Eugène Scribe. Cui wrote a [...] "characteristically savage press attack" [...] on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to Vladimir Stasov, disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public. Nevertheless, The Oprichnik continues to be performed {{from time to time}} in Russia.|$|E

5000|$|Ad usum Delphini means “for {{the use of}} the Dauphin”. It is a {{collection}} of classical Greek and Latin texts used by the Duke of Montausier for his education of the Grand Dauphin, son of King Louis XIV. This text was {{on the cover of the}} traditional texts which had been purified because they contained passages considered <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> or inappropriate for the youth. The collection includes 64 volumes published from 1670 to 1698. Authors affected were Homer, Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence, Ovid, Juvenal and Martial.|$|R
50|$|The {{first level}} is permission, which {{involves}} the sexologist giving the client permission {{to feel comfortable}} about a topic or permission to change their lifestyle or to get medical assistance. This level was created because many clients only require the permission to speak and voice their concerns about sexual issues {{in order to understand}} and move past them, often without needing the other levels of the model. The sexologist, in acting as a receptive, nonjudgmental listening partner, allows the client to discuss matters that would otherwise be <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for the individual to discuss.|$|R

Jim {{does not know}} what a rundown is, but is <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to ask because he has been making such a poor {{impression}} with Charles. Jim spends much of the day {{trying to figure out what}} a rundown is, making several failed attempts to figure it out by chatting vaguely about it with Charles and other coworkers. When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look at it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E
500|$|In December 1900, Trenchard {{returned}} to England, arriving by hospital ship at Southampton. [...] He hobbled {{with the aid}} of sticks down the gangplank where his concerned parents met him. [...] As a disabled soldier without independent financial means, Trenchard was now at his lowest point. [...] He spent the next fortnight at the Mayfair nursing home for disabled officers which was run by the Red Cross. [...] Trenchard's case {{came to the attention of}} Lady Dudley, by whose philanthropic efforts the Mayfair nursing home operated. [...] Through her generosity she arranged for Trenchard to see a specialist who told Trenchard that he needed to spend several months in Switzerland where the air was likely to be of benefit to his lung. [...] Trenchard and his family could not afford the expense and Trenchard was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to explain the situation. [...] However, without asking any questions, Lady Dudley presented Trenchard with a cheque to cover the costs.|$|E
500|$|Mike Simpson, Creative Assembly's studio director, {{started a}} blog in October 2009, in a {{deliberate}} attempt {{to engage with}} the game's user community and counter some of the negative reaction which the game had received. He explained The Creative Assembly [...] "were not entirely happy {{with the state of}} Empire: Total War when it went out", but felt the Metacritic user rating of 67 percent was unfair, stating that his reason for blogging was a concern that the negative ratings could even damage the amount of money available for developing future games. In later posts he described the February 2009 release date as [...] "commercial reality", and explained why they had hit significant problems with the game's AI close to release. Simpson describes the campaign AI as [...] "by far the most complex code edifice I’ve ever seen in a game", and said that they had reached a tipping point where consideration of too many factors led to an AI which [...] "disagrees with itself chronically and often ends up paralysed by indecision". It was only after patch 1.5—six months after the original release—that Simpson felt comfortable sending it to friends of his, having previously been <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> about the flaws. With regard to the battle AI, Simpson said that the lead battle AI programmer had left to return to his family just {{before the end of the}} project. The battle AI at that stage struggled to beat good players even with an obvious level of handicapping, and it had taken some time for other programmers to understand three years' worth of code; progress had been [...] "frustratingly slow" [...] as they strived for a game where real world tactics would work.|$|E
50|$|Holmes {{eventually}} {{qualified as}} a Sergeant Class 1 PTI, although she {{remained in the}} Adjutant General's Corps after the disbandment of the WRAC in 1992. She also became British Army judo champion and in Army athletics events once competed in the men's 800 metres at a meeting, as it was considered that for her {{to run in the}} women's event would be <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for the other competitors. At another event, she competed in and won an 800 metres, a 3000 metres and a relay race all in a single day. She also won the heptathlon.|$|R
50|$|In Egypt, {{adolescent}} SRH {{education is}} controversial and is opposed by some parents, religious and community leaders, policymakers, service providers, {{and young people}} due to social taboos {{and the belief that}} these issues are <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to discuss in public. The lack of continuity within the society leads to school-based or home-based SRH education to be insufficient in either the amount of information and/or the accuracy of that information. This obviously creates a challenge for young Egyptians, ages 10-29 which compose 40 percent of the Egyptian population, to attain important and accurate SRH information to stay healthy and safe.|$|R
5000|$|The 10-item Self-Concealment Scale (SCS) {{measures}} {{the degree to}} which a person tends to conceal personal information perceived as negative or distressing.

Representative items include: [...] "I have an important secret that I haven't shared with anyone", [...] "There are lots of things about me that I keep to myself", [...] "Some of my secrets have really tormented me", [...] "When something bad happens to me, I tend to keep it to myself", and [...] "My secrets are <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to share with others".|$|R

Messiah also said that in the years leading to 2010, the number of students classified as homeless increased because the school district became better able to identify homeless students and because the Late-2000s recession continued to have an effect on their families.|$|E

Television reports labelled the comics as negative influences, while a newspaper falsely stated {{that most of}} the comics were not copyrighted as the publishers feared arrest for posting the content; in reality most of the titles were likely illegally published without permission from the original Japanese publishers. The shōnen ai comics provided profits for the comic shops, which sold between 30 and 50 such comics per day. The moral panic regarding the gay male comics subsided.
