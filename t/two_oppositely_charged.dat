25|$|An {{ionic bond}} is formed when a metal loses {{one or more}} of its electrons, {{becoming}} a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the non-metal atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The <b>two</b> <b>oppositely</b> <b>charged</b> ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a non-metal, gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.|$|E

A charged tachyon traveling in a vacuum, therefore, undergoes a constant proper time acceleration and, by necessity, its worldline forms a hyperbola in space-time. However reducing a tachyon's energy increases its speed, so that the single hyperbola formed is of <b>two</b> <b>oppositely</b> <b>charged</b> tachyons with opposite momenta (same magnitude, opposite sign) which annihilate each other when they simultaneously reach infinite speed {{at the same place}} in space. (At infinite speed, the two tachyons have no energy each and finite momentum of opposite direction, so no conservation laws are violated in their mutual annihilation. The time of annihilation is frame dependent.) ...|$|E

Two platina wires, forming the electrodes {{of a powerful}} voltaic battery, were placed side by side, near each other, in distilled water, hermetically sealed up in a strong glass tube, some minute vegetable fibres being present in the water. When, from the evolution of gas and the consequent increased pressure, the bubbles formed on the electrodes were so small as to produce but feebly ascending currents, then it could be observed that the filaments present were attracted and repelled between the two wires, {{as they would have}} been between <b>two</b> <b>oppositely</b> <b>charged</b> surfaces in air or oil of turpentine, moving so quickly as to displace and disturb the bubbles and the currents which these tended to form. Now I think it cannot be doubted, that under similar circumstances, and with an abundant supply of electricity, of sufficient tension also, convective currents might have been formed; the attractions and repulsions of the filaments were, in fact, the elements of such currents (1572.), and therefore water, though almost infinitely above air or oil of turpentine as a conductor, is a medium in which similar currents can take place.|$|E

We use rheology to systematically study the viscoelastic properties {{as a function of}} salt concentration, chain length, chain length matching, and mixing stoichiometry of model complex coacervates of poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), PDMAEMA, and poly(acrylic acid), PAA. The dynamics of making and breaking ionic bonds between the <b>oppositely</b> <b>charged</b> chains underlie all linear viscoelastic properties of the complex coacervates. We treat (clusters of) ionic bonds as sticky points and find that there is a remarkable resemblance between the relaxation spectra of these complex coacervates and the classical sticky Rouse model for single polymer systems.

The viscoelastic properties of the complexes are very {{different from those of the}} individual components.

At intermediate interaction strengths, the formed complexes exhibit a scaling behaviour with respect to molecular weight typically for chain molecules in a bad solvent.

The dark antiatoms are made of <b>two</b> particles <b>oppositely</b> <b>charged</b> under a dark U(1) symmetry and can bind to terrestrial atoms because of a kinetic mixing between the photon and the massless dark photon, such that the dark particles acquire an electric millicharge ∼ ± 5. 10 − 4 e.
