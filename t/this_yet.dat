25|$|There {{are plenty}} of causes {{that lead to the}} {{occurrence}} of <b>this</b> <b>yet</b> to be solved this global issue. Among them, globalisation is the main cause undeniably. Globalisation originally symbolises a worldwide trend that helps to balance the economy between developed and developing countries, however the unfair outsourcing attempts of manufacturing labour from rich to the poor countries have led to extreme poverty which is defined as living on less than US$1 a day. (Atal, 2015) Balko (2010) suggests that when the world markets are opened to free trade under globalisation, a phenomenon of “race to the bottom” happens. Sweatshop is an obvious example of such phenomenon. Without transnational guidelines and regulations, large corporations in developed countries are moving their manufacturing plants to the countries that are more vulnerable, such as with less environmental restrictions and lower labour standards. To meet the demands and compete for the patronage, factories in developing countries start to lower their labour regulations by providing minimum wages and ignoring workplace safety requirements. As a result, workers in developing countries face the hardship while the large corporations gain profit.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of his {{freshman}} year, Frazier recorded a team-high 34-inch vertical in Penn State's preseason workouts. He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, [...] "Billy Oliver, Sasa , Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in <b>this</b> <b>yet,</b> so it was important just to get out there." [...] In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time. He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench. He shot 6-of-11 from the field, and 4-of-5 on three-pointers. Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain. If he starts making perimeter shots, then we're that much better. We've seen him where he can make shots in practice and do pretty well. We just needed to get him some confidence and get him into the flow." [...] The game would remain a season-high for him under the scoring category. Frazier was awarded his first start as a shooting guard on November 22, 2009 against Davidson; he registered 7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. He recorded a season-high 34 minutes. He finished the 2009–10 season averaging 5.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.7 turnovers. He played in all 31 regular season games.|$|E

[...] He said that the pairing of Jack and Tracy [...] "gave us another opportunity to enjoy the pairing of the polar opposite personalities". Canning reported that the Liz plot had [...] "its funny moments", but opined that it was hard to [...] "get past the fact this wasn't exactly the Liz we knew", in regards to her being a [...] "domineering boss that cares little about her employees." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that putting Alec Baldwin and Rip Torn together [...] "was a genius move." [...] She was complimentary towards Tina Fey, citing that it was [...] "another great week" [...] in her [...] "continuing portrayal of what being a hard-working gal is actually like."

Though, he said that Liz's story [...] "had a fitting message – that she is held to a different standard, yet shouldn't be, as a female head writer.
