She helps {{him back to}} the cabin, where she tells him she does [...] "not yet" [...] want to kill him, adding that [...] "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." [...] In a flashback [...] she watches Nic climbing up to the window, but she does not act, thus displaying her essential evil much like her hypothesis. In the cabin she cuts off her clitoris with scissors. They are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox.

But between the Doctor's garden and {{the one on the}} right hand there was that very picturesque contrivance--a common well; the door on the Desprez side had chanced <b>to</b> be <b>unbolted,</b> and now, through the arched aperture, a man's bearded face and an arm supporting a lantern were introduced into the world of windy darkness, where Anastasie concealed her woes. The light struck here and there among the tossing apple boughs, it glinted on the grass; but the lantern and the glowing face became the centre of the world.

There were steampipe collars <b>to</b> <b>unbolt</b> and pack, and bolt again, before that was done; while when Austin came upon Jefferson, he held up one hand from which the scalded skin was peeling.|$|E

It was rusty and would not yield, and, giving it up, she glanced about to see whence air could be admitted. There were four doors in the room, all low and arched, with clumsy locks and heavy handles. One opened into a closet, one into the passage; the third was locked, but the fourth opened easily, and, lifting her light, she peeped into a small octagon room, full of all manner of curiosities.

Soliloquies on this subject are numerous,—from the time of Hamlet, of Cato, and downwards. Perhaps the worst of them has more ingenuity, perhaps {{the best of them}} has less awfulness than the present.

40|$|Experiments are {{described}} which were {{conducted at the}} JPL Advanced Teleoperator Lab to demonstrate and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} various teleoperator control modes in the performance of a simulated Solar Max Satellite Repair (SMSR) task. THe SMSR was selected as a test because it is very rich in performance capability requirements and it actually has been performed by two EVA astronauts in the Space Shuttle Bay in 1984. The main subtasks are: thermal blanket removal; installation of a hinge attachment for electrical panel opening; opening of electrical panel; removal of electrical connectors; relining of cable bundles; replacement of electrical panel; securing parts and cables; re-mate electrical connectors; closing of electrical panel; and reinstating thermal blanket. The current performance experiments are limited to thermal blanket cutting, electrical panel unbolting and handling electrical bundles and connectors. In one formal experiment even different control modes were applied <b>to</b> the <b>unbolting</b> and reinsertion of electrical panel screws subtasks. The seven control modes are alternative combinations of manual position and rate control with force feedback and remote compliance referenced to force-torque sensor information. Force-torque sensor and end effector position data and task completion times were recorded for analysis and quantification of operator performance...|$|R

Author deals with {{problem of the}} massification of the Silesian culture in the 19 th century. Products of {{enlightenment}} and the modern world create a typical set of mental attitudes and preferences. People start to recognize the world as the emancipation of speed ideas. Changing ways of feeling and thinking lead to understand that Europe is an arena for progress and advancement. Satisfaction and pride are mixed with the feeling of nostalgia. The loss of the past individual being correlates with a march of the mass, the average culture, the mass migration. The author recognizes the mass thinking in the Upper Silesian culture in the 19 th century. An analysis concerns {{the problems of the}} common practices: the collective education system, the common reading, the group insurance and protection system, the mass architecture, the common communication and the mass photography and cinematography. Conclusion is pessimistic, the author claims that the power of the mass in the 19 th century has given impetus <b>to</b> the <b>unbolting</b> the door and opening it in the 20 th century. After 1945 the presence of the average thinking has opened the door for the socialist ideology, the socialist collective principles and the mass practice of everyday life.

60|$|There was {{something}} of a shudder about Clarence as he went <b>to</b> <b>unbolt</b> the back door; Martyn kept close to him. We saw them outside, and then Emily flew after them. From my window I could watch them advancing on the central gravel walk, Emily standing still between her brothers, clasping an arm of each. I saw the light near the ruin, and caught some sounds as of shrieks and of threatening voices, the light flitted towards the gable of the mullion rooms, and then was the concluding scream. All was over, and the three came back much agitated, Emily sinking into an armchair, panting, her hands over her face, and a nervous trembling through her whole frame, Martyn's eyes looking wide and scared, Clarence with the well-known look of terror on his face. He hurried to fetch the tray of wine and water that was always left on the table when anyone went to a party at night, but he shivered too much to prevent the glasses from jingling, and I had to pour out the sherry and administer it to Emily. 'Oh! poor, poor thing,' she gasped out.|$|E
60|$|Those {{were the}} days when men swooned over the ratchet-drill and the hand-forge, and where they fell they had leave to lie unless their bodies were {{in the way of}} their fellows' feet. And so, patch upon patch, and a patch over all, the {{starboard}} supporting-column was clouted; but when they thought all was secure, Mr. Wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never support working engines; at the best, it could only hold the guide-bars approximately true, he deadweight of the cylinders must be borne by vertical struts; and, therefore, a gang would repair to the bows, and take out, with files, the big bow-anchor davits, each of which was some three inches in diameter. They threw hot coals at Wardrop, and threatened to kill him, those who did not weep (they were ready to weep on the least provocation); but he hit them with iron bars heated at the end, and they limped forward, and the davits came with them when they returned. They slept sixteen hours on the strength of it, and in three days two struts were in place, bolted from the foot of the starboard supporting-column to the under side of the cylinder. There remained now the port, or condenser-column, which, though not so badly cracked as its fellow, had also been strengthened in four places with boiler-plate patches, but needed struts. They took away the main stanchions of the bridge for that work, and, crazy with toil, did not see till all was in place that the rounded bars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the air-pump levers to clear them. It was Wardrop's oversight, and he wept bitterly before the men as he gave the order <b>to</b> <b>unbolt</b> the struts and flatten them with hammer and the flame. Now the broken engine was underpinned firmly, and they took away the wooden shores from under the cylinders, and gave them to the robbed bridge, thanking God for even half a day's work on gentle, kindly wood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls. Eight months in the back-country among the leeches, at a temperature of 84 degrees moist, is very bad for the nerves.|$|E

Once during that night they were driven to cover until a great company of Romans had marched past.

After this there were other delays at gates still in the hands of their own people, which one by one were <b>unbolted</b> <b>to</b> them. Thus it was not far from daylight when at length they passed over a narrow bridge that spanned some ravine and through massive doors into a vast dim place which, as Miriam gathered from the talk of her captors, was the inner enclosure of the Temple.

40|$|Potash mining in Saskatchewan is most {{commonly}} done {{using one of}} two underground dry mining techniques: A variation of room and pillar mining, and stress relief mining. The potash ore that is mined has a large areal extent, is located at great depths, and is typically flat lying. However, some pockets in the ore body vary from the general geology, and are called anomalous. These areas can result in reduced stability from what would normally {{be found in the}} typical geological conditions. Potash mines install rock bolts in anomalous ground conditions to counter this. This is currently done using two different machines and results in a lot of down time for the mining operation. It has been theorized that by combining the two machines into one, time can be saved from the current process and result in increased stability of the mine back. This study pertains to the feasibility of attaching a bolting system to the back of a continuous boring machine for excavating anomalous ground conditions in underground potash mines. Three parts of this are examined: an estimate of the time saved by changing bolting methods, the change in mine roof stability due to the different bolting method, and the feasibility of crafting a machine that can fit in the confined space required. Bolting procedures are examined using individual task rates and projected for the proposed bolting methods. The change in stability that results from changing the bolting procedure is analyzed using finite element analysis. Finally, a concept machine is devised to show the ability to put such a bolting machine in the confined spaced available, and therefore showing the possibility of implementation. The geometric constraints, determined by a theoretical system, were used to create several feasible processes for installing bolts from the boring machine. This resulted in four potential variations in the process with regards to both the potential saved time and the stability of the tunnel. It was found that the potential for time savings were very large, with up to 72 % of the current bolt process time being saved in some situations. It was found that the largest part of the mining process in poor ground conditions is spent on the installation of bolts, and therefore the most time was saved by methods capable of bolt installation while the boring machine was in motion. Based on modelled stress metrics in areas requiring support, the current support measures appear more effective than the proposed bolting procedure. The analyzed stress metrics were still improved when compared <b>to</b> an <b>unbolted</b> ground scenario; Similar values of simulated curvature and displacement were found in the tunnel back at lower disseminated clay heights when partially bolted than were observed when the simulation was unbolted. This study shows the borer mounted bolter can be considered an advantageous mining method for efficiency purposes in poor ground conditions and could potentially be suitable in some geological conditions, but likely should not be used in all anomalous ground scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The future Westerschelde tunnel {{will consist}} of two {{separated}} tunnel tubes of 6. 6 km in length, one for each direction. The cross-section of each tube is just wide enough to contain two lanes of 3. 5 metres wide. Due to financial constraints a separate tube for pedestrians will not be built and the cross-section of the tube does not allow any room for a separated pavement {{along the side of}} the road. Therefore, the tubes will be connected by transverse links at intervals of 250 metres. In an emergency situation the doors to the transverse links will be <b>unbolted</b> <b>to</b> allow people to escape to the safe tube. Conflicts between moving traffic and escaping car drivers can result in another unsafe situationarried out in order to find a way to minimise this unsafety. In case of a required evacuation, safety measures should also be activated in the 'safe' tube as soon as possible in order to expel traffic from the left lane or even stop the traffic completely. This must be achieved in a safe manner for all road users. To analyse safety during evacuations, a study was conducted in three work packages, namely a literature review, a workshop with experts on traffic signalling and evacuation in tunnels, and a driving simulator study. Based on these studies, it can be concluded that moving all the traffic to the right driving lane is preferred over stopping all traffic in the tunnel tube. Introducing this measure in a rather gradual or a more abrupt manner did not result in too many differences. However, a more gradual introduction (by means of a white arrow before using a red cross) is more in correspondence with current experience. Therefore, this strategy is to be preferred. Using a variab Using a variable message sign with an indication of a running pedestrian is to be recommended, since this way road users are better prepared for the presence of pedestrians in the tunnel. The results from the questionnaires indicated that in general, subjects understand what kind of behaviour is required. The chances of panic in the unsafe tube are rather small. Especially when road users are informed adequately, they are expected to act calmly...|$|R

Another theory had the murderer firing through the transom, but Fink's wrist was powder-burned, indicating that he had not been fired at from a distance.

To do this the MP guarding the gates had to switch on the outer lights illuminating the entrance, open the inner gate, then open the outer gate. This was all against standard operating procedure, but seemed to be a regular occurrence for visitors arriving and people leaving the fort. Once the officer had cleared the gate the MP closed both gates and went back to his post. A little later the son of the officer-in-charge appeared at the gate and he was let in.

After reinforcements arrived, allowing police to retake the mosque, Dupree and several others were initially arrested at the scene. However, before Dupree could be taken into custody, Louis Farrakhan and Congressman Charles B. Rangel arrived at the scene, threatening a riot if Dupree was not released.|$|E
40|$|Why did {{reform in}} China {{and the former}} Soviet Union produce {{drastically}} different outcomes? Why did some provinces in China embrace faster economic reform than others? This article argues that the state sector and reform initiatives in the sub-national units, reform strategies, entrenchment and maturation of central planning, {{the size of the}} defence industry, policy choice and the historical context help explain the differences in Soviet and Chinese reform courses and outcomes. A predominant state sector in the former Soviet republics had stifled local reform initiatives. Gorbachev resorted to democratisation in order <b>to</b> <b>unbolt</b> the gate for popular support for marketisation, yet resulting in the breakup of the Soviet Union and destabilising the economy. In China, some provinces had sizable non-state sectors and were inclined to push forth marketization. Reform resulted in expanding non-state sectors, generating high growth and encouraging the regime to maintain its monopoly of power. China’s reform also benefited from a yet-to-be-entrenched and rudimentary central planning, a small defence sector, popular backlash against past policies, and reformist pragmatic strategy...|$|E
40|$|Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial diseases with economic concern to all phases of the poultry. The study was aimed to generate chicken IgY against Salmonella typhimurium and its physicochemical characterization <b>to</b> <b>unbolt</b> the obstacles for the usage of IgY as therapeutic agent in Poultry. Salmonella typhimurium whole cell antigen was prepared and immunized in white leghorn chickens. The immune eggs were collected and IgY was purified from the yolk by PEG extraction method, the purity of the IgY extract was estimated by SDS-PAGE. The peak titer of Anti-S. tyhpimurium-IgY in egg yolk was observed after 35 th day from the first immunization by ELISA. Total IgY concentration was found to be 30. 24 ± 0. 25 mg/ml after 25 th week of bird’s age. The specific reactivity of IgY was relatively stable at 60 o C and then significantly decreased at 70 o C. The pH stability of IgY was observed between pH 4. 0 and pH 10. IgY was more resistant to Trypsin compared to pepsin...|$|E
