5000|$|Secondary {{surveillance}} radar (SSR) {{is referred to}} as [...] "secondary", to distinguish it from the [...] "primary radar" [...] that works by passively reflecting a radio signal off the skin of the aircraft. Primary radar determines range and bearing to a target with reasonably high fidelity, but it cannot determine target elevation (altitude) reliably except at close range. SSR uses an active <b>transponder</b> (<b>beacon)</b> to transmit a response to an interrogation by a secondary radar. This response most often includes the aircraft's pressure altitude and a 4-digit octal identifier.|$|E
40|$|Airborne radar {{approach}} (ARA) concepts are being investigated {{as a part}} of NASA's Rotorcraft All-Weather Operations Research Program on advanced guidance and navigation methods. This research is being conducted using both piloted simulations and flight test evaluations. For the piloted simulations, a mathematical model of the airborne radar was developed for over-water ARAs to offshore platforms. This simulated flight scenario requires radar simulation of point targets, such as oil rigs and ships, distributed sea clutter, and <b>transponder</b> <b>beacon</b> replies. Radar theory, weather radar characteristics, and empirical data derived from in-flight radar photographs are combined to model a civil weather/mapping radar typical of those used in offshore rotorcraft operations. The resulting radar simulation is realistic and provides the needed simulation capability for ongoing ARA research...|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} these was the Speed Enforcement System (SES) {{employed}} by New Jersey Transit on their low-density Pascack Valley Line as a pilot program using a dedicated fleet of 13 GP40PH-2 locomotives. SES used a system of <b>transponder</b> <b>beacons</b> attached to wayside block signals to enforce signal speed. SES was disliked by engine crews due to its habit of causing immediate penalty brake applications without first sounding an overspeed alarm and giving the engineer a chance to decelerate. SES {{is in the process}} of being removed from this line, and is being replaced with CSS.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{tracking}} system for augmented reality and virtual set applications, {{based on an}} inertial navigation system aided by ultrasonic time-of-flight range measurements to a constellation of wireless <b>transponder</b> <b>beacons.</b> An extended Kalman filter operating on 1 -D range measurements allows the inertial sensors to filter out corrupt range measurements and perform optimal smoothing and prediction, {{while at the same}} time using the pre-screened range measurements to correct the drift of the inertial system. The use of inside-out ultrasonic tracking allows for tetherless tracking over a building-wide range with no acoustic propagation latency. We have created a simulation to account for error sources in the ultrasonic ranging system. The fully implemented tracking system is tested and found to have accuracy consistent with the simulation results. The simulation also predicts that with some further compensation of transducer misalignment, accuracies better than 2 mm can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} planning {{target volume}} margins for prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy based on inter- and intrafractionmotion using four daily localization techniques: three-point skinmark alignment, volumet-ric imaging with bony landmark registration, volumetric imaging with implanted fiducial marker registration, and implanted electromagnetic <b>transponders</b> (<b>beacons)</b> detection. Methods and Materials: Fourteen patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy for pros-tate cancer {{formed the basis}} of this study. Each patient was implanted with three electromagnetic transponders and underwent a course of 39 treatment fractions. Daily localization was based on three-point skinmark alignment followed by transponder detection and patient repositioning. Transponder positioning was verified by volumetric imaging with cone-beam computed tomography of the pelvis. Relative motion between the prostate gland and bony anatomy was quantified by offline analyses of daily cone-beam computed tomography. Intratreatment organ mo-tion was monitored continuously by the Calypso! System for quantification of intrafraction setup error. Results: As expected, setup error (that is, inter- plus intrafractionmotion, unless otherwise stated) was largest with skinmarkalignment, requiringmargins of 7. 5 mm, 11. 4 mm, and 16. 3 mm, in the lateral (LR), longitudinal (SI), and vertical (AP) directions, respectively. Margin requirements accounting for intrafraction motion were smallest for transponder detection localization techniques, requiring margins of 1. 4 mm (LR), 2. 6 mm (SI), and 2. 3 mm (AP) ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{what was}} {{the front line of}} nuclear defense, the Corporal missile was {{notoriously}} unreliable and inaccurate. It used a liquid-fueled rocket burning red fuming nitric acid and hydrazine; this required elaborate and time-consuming preparation immediately before launch, making its tactical responsiveness questionable. For guidance, it employed commands sent through a reworked World War II-era radar system. Until 1955, its in-flight accuracy was less than 50%, with only modest improvements thereafter. The first year of British test firings in 1959 yielded a success rate of only 46%, a dismal record which raised questions among military planners of its operational effectiveness in Germany. Guidance consisted of a complex system of internal and ground guidance. During the initial launch phase, inertial guidance (internal accelerometers) kept the missile in a vertical position and pre-set guidance steered it during its launch. The ground guidance system was a modified SCR584 pulse tracking radar which measured the missile's azimuth and elevation, as well as its slant range. This information was sent to an analog computer which calculated the trajectory and any necessary correction to hit the target. A Doppler radar was used to accurately measure the velocity and this information was also used in the trajectory calculation. The Doppler radar was also used to send the final range correction and warhead arming command after the missile re-entered the atmosphere. <b>Transponder</b> <b>beacons</b> were used in the missile to provide a return signal.|$|R
5000|$|The MLS Precision Distance Measuring Equipment (DME/P) {{functions}} {{in the same way}} as the navigation DME, but there are some technical differences. The <b>beacon</b> <b>transponder</b> operates in the frequency band 962 to 1105 MHz and responds to an aircraft interrogator. The MLS DME/P accuracy is improved to be consistent with the accuracy provided by the MLS azimuth and elevation stations.|$|R
40|$|An airborne, radar based, {{precision}} approach concept {{is being developed}} and flight tested {{as a part of}} NASA's Rotorcraft All-Weather Operations Research Program. A <b>transponder</b> based <b>beacon</b> landing system (BLS) applying state of the art X band radar technology and digital processing techniques, has been built and is being flight tested to demonstrate the concept feasibility. The BLS airborne hardware consists of an add on microprocessor, installed in conjunction with the aircraft weather/mapping radar, which analyzes the radar beacon receiver returns and determines range, localizer deviation, and glide slope derivation. The ground station is an inexpensive, portable unit which can be quickly deployed at a landing site. Results from the flight test program show that the BLS concept has a significant potential for providing rotorcraft with low cost, precision instrument approach capability in remote areas...|$|R
50|$|OSCAR III (a.k.a. OSCAR 3) is {{the third}} amateur radio {{satellite}} launched by Project OSCAR into Low Earth Orbit. OSCAR 3 was launched March 9, 1965 by a Thor-DM21 Agena D launcher from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Lompoc, California. The satellite, weighing 16.3 kg, was launched piggyback with seven United States Air Force satellites. The satellite employed no attitude control system. OSCAR III linear transponder lasted 18 days. More than 1000 amateurs in 22 countries communicated through the linear <b>transponder.</b> The two <b>beacon</b> transmitters continued operating for several months.|$|R

50|$|The UDOP (UHF Doppler) {{multistatic radar}} and multiradar system (MSRS) {{utilizes}} Doppler radar for missile tracking and trajectory measurement. A target is illuminated at 450MHz. Five receiving stations, located along the baselines with the lengths from 40 to 120 km, receive {{signals from the}} target's transponder at 900MHz. These five stations yield slant-range rate. To compute the range or position, an initial position is required from some other tracking system. The random error is 6 cm, but total error includes the systematic error of 2.7 m plus the initial error. UDOP had relatively low cost compared with other high-accuracy systems. In the US, MSRS has found important application in the precision measurement of missile trajectories at the Air Force Eastern Test Range, which extends from the Florida mainland to the Indian Ocean. These MSRSs include the AZUSA, the MISTRAM, and the UDOP. All systems employ a cooperative <b>beacon</b> <b>transponder</b> on the observed target and a ground-based transmitting station with several receiving stations at separate, precisely located sites.|$|R
40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine the antenna radiation pattern measurements of the Hyper-X, X- 43 ship 2 aircraft. One test was conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF) on January 24 -January 27, 2000. A second test was done at MicroCraft in Tullahoma Tennessee by the Naval Air Weapons Center (NAWC) China Lake, California on September 8, 2001. The overall test objective was to gather qualitative antenna radiation pattern data from installed antennas on the HXRV. This objective was accomplished by collecting antenna radiation patterns at selected elevations of the HXRV. The test data was used to identify areas of RF coverage and assist in positioning the P- 3 aircraft for best RF reception. The antenna pattern data presented nulls and possible low RF reception areas around the aircraft. This led to a redesign of the RF system. The redesigned system provided redundancy in case a telemetry transmitter should fail. The redesign provided more complete RF coverage within the antenna's capabilities. A second look at the flight path and necessary data collection led {{to a change in}} the <b>beacon</b> <b>transponder</b> system...|$|R
40|$|An {{emerging}} body of data {{suggests that}} hypofractionated radiation schedules, where a higher dose per fraction is {{delivered in a}} smaller number of sessions, may be superior to conventional fractionation schemes in terms of both tumour control and toxicity profile in the management of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. However, the optimal hypofractionation scheme is still the subject of scientific debate. Modern computer-driven technology enables the safe implementation of extreme hypo fractionation (often referred to as stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]). Several studies are currently being conducted to clarify the yet unresolved issues regarding treatment techniques and fractionation regimens. Recently, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) issued a model policy indicating that data supporting the use of SBRT for prostate cancer have matured to a point where SBRT could be considered an appropriate alternative for select patients with low-to-intermediate risk disease. The present article reviews some of the currently available data and examines the impact of tracking technology to mitigate intra-fraction target motion, thus, potentially further improving the clinical outcomes of extreme hypofractionated radiation therapy in appropriately selected prostate cancer patients. The Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown (CCU) ’s currently ongoing Phase I feasibility study is described; it delivers 45 Gy in five fractions using prostate fixation via a rectal balloon, and urethral sparing via catheter placement with on-line intra-fractional motion tracking through <b>beacon</b> <b>transponder</b> technology...|$|R
