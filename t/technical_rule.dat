Downforce on the cars was reduced with the diffuser restricted to help reduce the amount of grip available. In between the Monaco and Spanish Grands Prix, the teams tried out the revised cars in test sessions throughout the week. Several teams experienced problems with their revised cars; Ligier suffered two cracked wing mountings, while Williams noted a cracked mounting during testing at Jerez. The biggest incident to note was that of Pedro Lamy in a Lotus car at the Silverstone Circuit. While approaching the Bridge corner on the circuit, the rear wing on the Lotus detached itself leading to a sudden loss of downforce. The Lotus cartwheeled off the circuit at , flying through a protective fence, landing in a spectator access tunnel. Lamy was hospitalised {{as a result of the}} accident. In the week leading up to the Spanish race, Benetton team boss Flavio Briatore criticised the FIA, accusing the president Max Mosley of making [...] "ill-considered, snap decisions" [...] and that some of the components on the Benetton car may not have been subjected to quality control checks.

For example, moving average rules are used to make &quot;buy &quot; or &quot;sell &quot; decisions at each day. In this paper, to explore the potential prediction power of technical analysis, we present a genetic programming based system FGP (Financial Genetic Programming), which specialises in taking some well known <b>technical</b> <b>rules</b> and adapting them to prediction problems. FGP uses the power of genetic programming to generate decision trees through efficient combination of <b>technical</b> <b>rules</b> with self-adjusted thresholds. The generated rules {{are more suitable for}} the prediction problem at hand. FGP was tested extensively on historical DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) index data through a specific prediction problem.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} mixed results {{with regard to the}} success of technical trading rules. Studies that provide positive evidence that simple technical trading rules generate valuable signals are [Brock, Lakonishok and Lebaron (1992), Karjalainen, R. E. (1994), Bessembinder and Chan (1995), Mills (1997), and Fernandez et al. (1999) ]. Studies rejecting the utility of technical trading rules are [Hudson et al. (1996) or Allen, F. and Karjalainen R. E. (1999) ]. A recent body of work has applied evolutionary algorithms to the design of trading rules [see Karjalainen (1994) and Allen and Karjalainen (1999) for genetic programming models of trading and Fernandez et al (2001) and Nuñez-Letamendia (2002) for genetic algorithms models]. The basic approach of these studies is to choose trading rules based on an genetic optimisation procedure using in-sample-data and then testing the performance of these rules in out-of-the-sample data. This paper tests whether the most popular <b>technical</b> <b>rule</b> – the moving average – generates profits in the Madrid Stock Exchange by utilizing genetic algorithms to optimise the rule in the in-sample period (May 1990 - May 1995) and applying it to the out-sample period (May 1995 – May 1996) over 25 stocks and indexes.

Certainty amounts to predictability {{of the consequences}} of actions prescribed by legal norms conceived as <b>technical</b> <b>rules</b> (i. e. : rules prescribing conducts as means directed to achieve the agent’s goals). The lack of legal certainty is a shortcoming because it impedes to use legal norms as instruments for choosing the lines of conduct more suitable to achieve our self-assigned goals. Indeed, only if the degree of certainty of a legal system is high enough, the agents can link the conduct prescribed by legal norms with consequences desirable or undesirable, using legal norms as efficient <b>technical</b> <b>rules.</b> Only in this case, it is possible to single out ex ante the «wrong» choices, avoiding those action plans that produce, more or less probably, unwanted consequences...|$|R

Materials and Methods: We performed across-sectional study, with a popu-lation of 49 987 women over 50 years of Cartagena. We estimated a sample size of 909 women, obtained by conglomerates. To gather information was used: a socio-demographic survey, the Apgar questionnaire to measure perception of family functioning, the Duke- 11 questionnaireto measure perceived social support and a scale to measure satisfaction with services. For the analysis of the data using descriptive statistics, were calculated to estimate OR association between some factors and the use of mammography, using the statistical software version 15 SPSSS. Explanatory variables were considered using mammography to those with a chi 2 test less than 5 %. Results: A total of 909 women, 59. 5 % (541) reported having had mammograms, only 314 (34. 5 %), were made in the past two years, according to the national <b>technical</b> <b>rule.</b> Among the factors that ex¬plain the use of mammography, is having partner [OR= 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 04 to 1. 8) ], coexisting with less than four [OR = 0. 4 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 6) ] and have completed comprehensive school and older [OR = 2. 2 (95 % CI 1. 67 to 3. 04) ].
