500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in <b>them.</b> <b>Right</b> <b>now</b> our mission is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghanâ€“Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E
500|$|When the {{election}} was held, there was a 12 percent swing towards the Liberal Party in South Australia, or 7 percent on two party preferred. There was a large swing against Labor owing to the dissatisfaction with the Whitlam administration, but it generally {{went directly to the}} Liberal Party. Against this background, and with relatively little media attention paid to the LM and its cause, Despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply, Hall struggled to be re-elected, gaining only 6.5 per cent of the Senate vote and relying on preferences, ironically from Labor. In South Australia, Labor gained 41 per cent of the vote, and the Liberals 51 per cent. In the lower house, the LM managed only 6.2% across the 12 seats, again recording its best result in Boothby, with 10.4%. Hall's hope for Australia-wide support for the LM was dashed owing to the previous events, with the party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states. The lower house candidates in the Australian Capital Territory registered around 3%, but the senate candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland received less than 1%. Hall's opinion was that [...] "the Liberal Movement was for its part in the contest happy to have survived." [...] Nevertheless, Hall was still adamant the LM's future was as a standalone entity: [...] "The LM is going to continue as an Australia-wide party ... We shall {{have to go through the}} sickening process of having the Liberal party make overtures to us once again ... I would like to tell <b>them</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> that they will be wasting their breath." [...] Despite Hall's defiance, the poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years, and he no longer had the balance of power and the resulting media exposure. This was a problem, as the party was largely centred around his personality.|$|E

Of the pairing, Sweeney said [...] "their past is such a deep relationship and ultimately a friendship and a trust that they have with each other." [...] They ended up marrying, but it was [...] "permanently ended" [...] when EJ DiMera (James Scott) entered the picture. EJ, the son of longtime crime boss Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo), developed an obsession with Sami, and ended up controversially [...] "raping" [...] her. Sami became pregnant and gave birth to twins; her daughter's father is Lucas, and son's paternity belonged to EJ. EJ had asked Sami for sex to save Lucas' life, while he was trapped and nearly died. This led to a sham wedding between EJ and Sami, {{in exchange for the}} DiMeras ending the fifty-year family feud between the Brady family. Although she initially hated him, the couple ended up in a [...] "night of passion" [...] resulting in another pregnancy.
