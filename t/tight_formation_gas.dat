40|$|In {{order to}} predict the nature and {{distribution}} of natural fracturing, Advanced Resources Inc. (ARI) incorporated concepts of rock mechanics, geologic history, and local geology into a geomechanical approach for natural fracture prediction within mildly deformed, tight (low-permeability) gas reservoirs. Under the auspices of this project, ARI utilized and refined this approach in tight gas reservoir characterization and exploratory activities in three basins: the Piceance, Wind River and the Anadarko. The primary focus of this report is the knowledge gained on natural fractural prediction along with practical applications for enhancing gas recovery and commerciality. Of importance to <b>tight</b> <b>formation</b> <b>gas</b> production are two broad categories of natural fractures: (1) shear related natural fractures and (2) extensional (opening mode) natural fractures. While arising from different origins this natural fracture type differentiation based on morphology is sometimes inter related. Predicting fracture distribution successfully is largely a function of collecting and understanding the available relevant data {{in conjunction with a}} methodology appropriate to the fracture origin. Initially ARI envisioned the geomechanical approach to natural fracture prediction as the use of elastic rock mechanics methods to project the nature and distribution of natural fracturing within mildly deformed, tight (low permeability) gas reservoirs. Technical issues and inconsistencies during the project prompted re-evaluation of these initial assumptions. ARI's philosophy for the geomechanical tools was one of heuristic development through field site testing and iterative enhancements to make it a better tool. The technology and underlying concepts were refined considerably {{during the course of the}} project. As with any new tool, there was a substantial learning curve. Through a heuristic approach, addressing these discoveries with additional software and concepts resulted in a stronger set of geomechanical tools. Thus, the outcome of this project is a set of predictive tools with broad applicability across low permeability gas basins where natural fractures play an important role in reservoir permeability. Potential uses for these learnings and tools range from rank exploration to field-development portfolio management. Early incorporation of the permeability development concepts presented here can improve basin assessment and direct focus to the high potential areas within basins. Insight into production variability inherent in tight naturally fractured reservoirs leads to improved wellbore evaluation and reduces the incidence of premature exits from high potential plays. A significant conclusion of this project is that natural fractures, while often an important, overlooked aspect of reservoir geology, represent only one aspect of the overall reservoir fabric. A balanced perspective encompassing all aspects of reservoir geology will have the greatest impact on exploration and development in the low permeability gas setting...|$|E

Tight gas reservoir refers to hydrocarbons reservoir that content unconventional gas. Tight gas reservoir usually possesses low permeability rocks that make the gas tricky and difficult to produce(Noeth, 2004). Tight gas reservoirs are distributed in many part of the world for example,Australia, Asia and North America.

We perform a sensitivity analysis on the error between the pseudo-pressure before and after correction and show its variation with porosity, permeability, skin, formation thickness, and temperature. This can be helpful to understand the importance of correcting pseudo-pressure under different conditions.

30|$|<b>Tight</b> <b>formations</b> {{normally}} have production problems mainly due to very low matrix permeability and {{various forms of}} formation damage that occur during drilling completion and production operation. In naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs, gas is mainly stored in the rock matrix with very low permeability, and the natural fractures have the main contribution on total gas production. Therefore, identifying natural fractures characteristics in the <b>tight</b> <b>formations</b> is essential for well productivity evaluations. Well testing and logging are the common tools employed to evaluate well productivity. Use of image log can provide fracture static parameters, and welltest analysis can provide data related to reservoir dynamic parameters. However, due to the low matrix permeability {{and complexity of the}} formation in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs, welltest data are affected by long wellbore storage effect that masks the reservoir response to pressure change, and it may fail to provide dual-porosity dual-permeability models dynamic characteristics such as fracture permeability, fracture storativity ratio and interporosity flow coefficient. Therefore, application of welltest and image log data in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs for meaningful results may not be well understood and the data may be difficult to interpret. This paper presents the estimation of fracture permeability in naturally fractured <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> <b>formations,</b> by integration of welltest analysis results and image log data based on Kazemi’s simplified model. Reservoir simulation of dual-porosity and dual-permeability systems and sensitivity analysis are performed for different matrix and fracture parameters to understand the relationship between natural fractures parameters with welltest permeability. The simulation results confirmed reliability of the proposed correlation for fracture permeability estimation. A field example is also shown to demonstrate application of welltest analysis and image log data processing results in estimating average permeability of natural fractures for the tight gas reservoir.|$|R
40|$|Prevention {{of water}} {{blocking}} and optimization of multiscale flow channels will increase gas production of tight reservoirs. Physical properties of samples from representative tight gas reservoirs were measured {{before and after}} high temperature treatment. Results show that, {{with the increase of}} treatment temperature, mass decreases, acoustic transit time increases, and permeability and porosity increase. Permeability begins to increase dramatically if treatment temperature exceeds the threshold value of thermal fracturing, which is 600 ~ 700 °C, 500 ~ 600 °C, 300 ~ 500 °C, and 300 ~ 400 °C for shale, mudstone, tight sandstone, and tight carbonate rock, respectively. Comprehensive analyses indicate that the mechanisms of heat treatment on tight porous media include evaporation and dehydration of water, change of mineral structure, generation of microfracture, and network connectivity. Meanwhile, field implementation is reviewed and prospected. Interpretations indicate that, according to the characteristics of multiscale mass transfer in <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> <b>formation,</b> combining heat treatment with conventional stimulation methods can achieve the best stimulation result...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is perhaps}} the major stimulation technique {{which is used to}} enhance production in low permeability reservoirs and also in unconventional resources such as <b>tight</b> <b>formations,</b> shale <b>gas</b> and Coalbed Methane. Performing lab simulations, before real field practices, to understand different aspects of complicated process involved in a fracturing job would be very beneficial. For this purpose, and in order to consider the effect of all three principal stresses in the field the experiments must be conducted on a cube shaped sample. Using the true tri-axial stress cell (TTSC) developed at the Department of Petroleum Engineering of Curtin University it is possible to simulate a fracturing job on samples up to 30 cm. Three independent stresses {{can be applied to the}} sample with pore pressure being increased independently. The fluid injection causes the fracture to develop within the sample. We have performed lab experiments on very small size cube samples of 5 cm. No similar experiments have been reported in the literature which is believed to be due to the need for expensive laboratory set up and accurate measurement facilities. This is while the maximum sample size that can be retrieved from downhole is no more than 5 cm: this indicates the importance of lab experiments on this sample size. The initial experiments carried out on synthetically made samples and on a few real tight sandstones indicated very successful results which supports the idea of testing small scale samples. Performing hydraulic fracturing in the lab on small size samples with the objective of upsclaing the results to represent real field practices needs applying the scaling laws. Different scaling laws proposed in the past have been used in this study to investigate their applications on <b>tight</b> <b>formations.</b> It was possible to conduct this study on synthetically made samples with different sizes and assess the applicability of the scaling laws. The preliminary results are in a relatively good agreement with numerical simulations which were performed for calibration purposes. The results of some of the lab experiments performed using the TTSC will be presented in this paper and conclusions will be made...|$|R
40|$|Drilling is {{a common}} process in mining and {{petroleum}} engineering applications which have different objectives. For example, drilling deep boreholes in <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> <b>formations</b> and <b>gas</b> shales is becoming more popular in {{the oil and gas}} industry. By contrast, drilling deep small sized holes for mineral exploration in hard rocks is performed to obtain samples for grade analysis purposes. In both applications optimising the drilling process includes using the most effective operating parameters such as rotation speed and weight-on-bit in order to maximise the rate of penetration. Obtaining the optimum drilling parameters requires sensitivity analysis over a range of data, which would be costly and time consuming during real field operations. Therefore, conducting several experimental simulations in the lab would be very beneficial before field operations begin. A drilling rig was designed and developed to simulate various drilling scenarios. The rig works in conjunction with an existing true triaxial stress cell (TTSC) which is in use for different petroleum related applications. The rig allows drilling into a cubic rock sample of up to 300 mm size. Three independent stresses {{can be applied to the}} sample to simulate real in-situ field stress conditions while the sample may be saturated with fluid. A significant feature of the rig is its ultra-high speed rotation which can rotate up to 8000 rpm: this is to simulate hard rock drilling for mineral exploration applications where large weight-on-bit could damage the bit cutters. With the proposed design, a drilling fluid of any type can be circulated in the simulated borehole similar to the real situation, to study its effect on drilling performance. The TTSC drilling lid is equipped with torque and drag measurement systems which are two important drilling parameters to be recorded during drilling operation. It is believed that this new drilling rig will open opportunities for performing major new applied research in the area of more efficient drilling in both oil and <b>gas</b> bearing <b>formations</b> and mineral exploration applications...|$|R

40|$|Tight gas {{reservoirs}} {{normally have}} production problems due to very low matrix permeability and significant damage during well drilling, completion, stimulation and production. Therefore {{they might not}} flow gas to surface at optimum rates without advanced production improvement techniques. After well stimulation and fracturing operations, invaded liquids such as filtrate will flow from the reservoir into the wellbore, as gas is produced during well cleanup.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{has recently}} been the completion of choice for most <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> bearing <b>formations.</b> It has proven successful to produce these formations in a commercial manner. However, some considerations {{have to be taken}} into account to design an optimum stimulation treatment that leads to the maximum possible productivity. These considerations include, but not limited to, non-Darcy flow and multiphase flow effects inside the fracture. These effects reduce the fracture conductivity significantly. Failing to account for that results in overestimating the deliverability of the well and, consequently, to designing a fracture treatment that is not optimum. In this work a thorough investigation of non-Darcy flow and multi-phase flow effects on the productivity of hydraulically fractured wells is conducted and an optimum fracture design is proposed for a <b>tight</b> <b>gas</b> <b>formation</b> in south Texas using the Unified Fracture Design (UFD) Technique to compensate for the mentioned effects by calculating the effective fracture permeability in an iterative way. Incorporating non-Darcy effects results in an optimum fracture that is shorter and wider than the fracture when only Darcy calculations are considered. That leads to a loss of production of 5, 18 percent due to dry and multiphase non-Darcy flow effects respectively. A comparison between the UFD and 3 D simulators is also done to point out the differences in terms of methodology and results. Since UFD incorporated the maximum dimensionless productivity index in the fracture dimensions design, unlike 3 D simulators, it can be concluded that using UFD to design the fracture treatment and then use the most important fracture parameters outputs (half length and CfDopt) as inputs in the simulators is a recommended approach...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is widely}} used to improve well productivity especially in unconventional reservoirs. This costly operation, however, sometimes underperforms. One {{of the main reasons}} for this poor performance is poor clean-up efficiency of injected fracturing fluid (FF). In this work, a parametric study of FF clean-up efficiency of hydraulic fractured vertical wells was performed with 49152 simulations (in 12 sets) consisting of injection, soaking and production periods. Due to the large number of required simulations, that were conducted using a commercial reservoir simulator, a developed computer code was used to automatically read input data, run simulations and creates output data. In each set (consisting of 4096 runs), simultaneous impacts of 12 parameters (fracture permeability, matrix permeability and capillary pressure, end points and exponents of Corey gas and FF relative permeability curve in both matrix and fracture) were studied. To sample the variables domain and analyse results, two-level full factorial experimental design and linear surface model describing dependency of gas production loss (GPL), compared to 100 clean-up, to pertinent parameters at three production periods (10, 30 and 365 days) were considered and supported by the tornado charts of fitted equations, frequency of simulations with given GPL and FF saturation maps. Results indicate that generally parameters controlling FF mobility within fracture had greatest impact on GPL reduction. However in sets with very low matrix permeability especially when applied pressure drop during production is low, the effect of fluid mobility in the matrix on GPL is more pronounced, in other words, it is important how gas and FF flow within matrix rather than how fast fracture is cleaned. In <b>tighter</b> <b>gas</b> <b>formations,</b> generally more GPL and slower clean-up was observed. The effect of matrix capillary pressure on GPL reduction was more pronounced when drawdown was very low and/or soaking time was extended. This observation was more profound in <b>tighter</b> <b>formations,</b> i. e. for these formations, the effect of a change in drawdown and/or soaking time on matrix capillary pressure and GPL was more pronounced. These findings {{can be used to make}} better decisions on the performance and optimised design of hydraulic fracturing, which is a costly but widely used stimulation technique for unconventional low permeability gas reservoirs...|$|R

(4) Horizontal well multi-stage fracturing and massive fracturing can increase fracture area and fracture volume, and increase the contact area with wetting phases, this will result in a greater imbibition and a great recovery of oil.|$|R
