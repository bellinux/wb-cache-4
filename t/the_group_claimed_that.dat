5|$|Two {{members of}} the group, Beyoncé and Rowland each {{released}} one album, while Michelle Williams released two. While each member achieved domestic success, Beyoncé's had been regarded as the most successful {{with the release of}} Dangerously in Love (2003), which enjoyed international commercial success and acclaim. This, along with their other ongoing projects, led to speculation over the disbandment of Destiny's Child. Amidst rumors and speculations, Rowland announced in 2004 their return to the studio to record what would become their fifth and final album. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity to each other kept them together.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were {{quoted as saying that}} Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Humility was an {{important}} principle. No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show {{off in front of}} someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.|$|E

25|$|On January 27, 2012, a {{group of}} Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the {{premises}} of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> their action was {{in retaliation for the}} burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which they called an “anti-Russian … disgraceful act” and “one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court".|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Knowles' debut solo album Dangerously in Love (2003), rumors spread about a {{possible}} split of Destiny's Child after each member had experienced solo success and had ongoing projects. Comparisons were drawn to Justin Timberlake, who {{did not return to}} band NSYNC after his breakthrough debut solo album, Justified. Rowland responded to such rumors, announcing they were back in the studio together. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the reunion was destined to happen and that their affinity to each other kept them cohesive. Margeaux Watson, arts editor at Suede magazine, suggested that Knowles [...] "does not want to appear disloyal to her former partners," [...] and called her decision to return to the group [...] "a charitable one". Knowles' mother, Tina, wrote a 2002-published book, titled Destiny's Style: Bootylicious Fashion, Beauty and Lifestyle Secrets From Destiny's Child, an account of how fashion influenced Destiny's Child's success.|$|E
500|$|This account further {{states that}} when the Order's Grand Mistress {{migrated}} to Australia, Long took over as the group's new Grand Master. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Long [...] "implemented {{the next stage of}} Sinister Strategy [...] to make the teachings known on a large scale". From the late 1970s onward, Long encouraged the establishment of new ONA groups, which were known as [...] "temples", and from 1976 onward he authored an array of texts for the tradition, codifying and extending its teachings, mythos, and structure. These texts are typically written in English, although they include passages of Classical Greek as well as terms from Sanskrit and Arabic, reflecting Long's fluency in such languages. After examining these texts, the historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke stated that in them, Long [...] "evokes a world of witches, outlaw peasant sorcerers, orgies and blood sacrifices at lonely cottages in the woods and valleys of this area [...] where he has lived since the early 1980s".|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>groups</b> cite {{several reasons}} for its {{assertion}} of sovereignty, all connected to what they {{refer to as the}} [...] "colonial apartheid" [...] of the reservation system in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> control by <b>the</b> United States has led to massive unemployment, poverty and disease among the Lakota people and also alleges that 150 years of U.S. administration is responsible for the statistical poverty of Lakota lands. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> withdrawal from <b>the</b> United States will reverse these problems, and help reestablish the Lakota language and culture. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> also <b>claims</b> persistent violations by the United States of their treaties with the Lakota.|$|R

500|$|During the {{following}} months, Jesús Dávila of NCM Noticias began circulating seven {{questions for the}} EPB. On October 12, 2010, the responses attributed to Comandante Guasábara were published by that journalist. In response to the organization's role in the political environment during that particular juncture, the Macheteros expressed {{that they were being}} [...] "patient and responsible", [...] "hearing the complaints of the people" [...] and warning that [...] "their patience and passiveness were reaching an end". <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> they had obtained information related to government corruption and the influence of foreign interests that pressured them to act, since [...] "standing still with their arms crossed [...] violate their elemental [...] as an armed revolutionary organization", warning that they no longer intended to [...] "scream slogans" [...] at rallies, but were instead waiting [...] "to strike the adequate objective at the adequate time and place". When questioned about a draft announced by the organization some time prior to the interview, Guasábara responded by noting that [...] "being at war, the existence of Machetero comandos and permanent recruitment will be necessary [...] until we declare the Republic." [...] The EPB described its strategy as one that evolved in three steps emerging from the rearguard; the first being the defensive {{as a response to the}} enemy's offensive, the second being a period of strategic consolidation and preparation of a counterattack plan and the third being the implementation of this plan in contrast to the government's politics.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, The FFRF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the IRS for not {{enforcing}} its own electioneering laws. The FFRF cited in its suit the placement of full page ads by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association; the diocese requiring priests to read a statement urging Catholics to vote; and the institution of [...] "Pulpit Freedom Sunday". <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> not enforcing the federal tax codes that prohibit tax-exempt religious organizations from electioneering is a violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. The group stated that the increasing involvement of religious institutions in politics was [...] "blatantly and deliberately flaunting the electioneering restrictions".|$|E
2500|$|Reza Iman, {{who is a}} {{spokesperson}} for <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the group {{has been active in}} the United States for almost 30 years, and defended Hizb ut-Tahrir's activities, stating in an interview that [...] "The call is not to bring that [...] here to this country or anything of that sort. The message is for Muslim countries to return to Islamic values." [...] DePaul University history professor Thomas Mockaitis stated that [...] "I have not seen any evidence they have engaged in violent activity in the U.S." [...] and that the group's views and goals, while controversial, did not warrant its labeling as a terrorist group.|$|E
5000|$|The {{organisation}} [...] "You're teaching {{our children}} what?"

2500|$|Ansar al-Sharia {{issued a}} {{statement}} denouncing Haftar's operation as a [...] "war against the religious Muslim youth". The group instead claimed {{that they had been}} the subject of a hate campaign by those against Islam and Sharia, and that their opponents were the real terrorists. The group instead claimed that they wished to safeguard Muslim blood and had not hindered the building of Libya's security organisations. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the campaign against them was being conducted by [...] "evil television channels" [...] and were led by [...] "ex-regime sympathisers and secularists supported by their masters in the west".

[...] <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Emerson's switch violated the federal ethics code and post-employment regulations for officeholders. [...] NDP MP Peter Julian has also called for an inquiry, claiming that the additional benefits Emerson received as a member compared to those he would have received as an opposition MP carry at least the appearance that Emerson acted in his own private interest.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> doctors {{preferentially}} {{prescribe drugs}} that are marketed to them over better or cheaper options because they are beholden to drug companies from which they accept gifts.

2500|$|After this {{announcement}} by Massachusetts supporting OpenDocument, {{a large number}} of people and organizations spoke up about the policy, both pro and con (see the references section).

However, InternetNews and Linux Weekly News noted that CAGW has received funding from Microsoft, and that in 2001 CAGW was caught running an astroturfing campaign on behalf of Microsoft when two letters they submitted supporting Microsoft in Microsoft's anti-trust case were found to have the signatures of deceased persons (Linux Weekly News). James Prendergast, executive director of a coalition named [...] "Americans for Technology Leadership" [...] (ATL), also criticized the state's decision in a Fox News article.
