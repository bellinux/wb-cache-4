5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he always seems to be watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> things out.|$|E
5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On the ride home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} several vocal {{tracks for}} a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album, Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album. Garfunkel refused to learn the songs {{in the studio and}} would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits despite Simon's requests. An official spokesperson remarked, [...] "Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life {{that it had to be}} his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I'm sure there will be other projects that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> on together. They are still friends." [...] The material was later released on Simon's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones. Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album. In 1990, the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked his partner, calling him [...] "the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me," [...] to which Simon responded, [...] "Arthur and I agree about almost nothing. But it's true, I have enriched his life quite a bit." [...] After three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991 Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, which was released a few months later. Art Garfunkel had offered to lend his friend a hand in creating another park reunion in which Simon declined, leading the concert as a solo act.|$|E

500|$|Ani {{has been}} {{listed on the}} [...] by World Monuments Fund (WMF) since 1996. In May 2011 the WMF and the Turkish Ministry of Culture {{launched}} {{what they call a}} conservation project focusing on the cathedral and the nearby Church of the Redeemer. The project is funded by the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the U.S. State Department. Before the project a steel structure was installed around the cathedral, said to prevent its cracked sandstone walls from collapsing. The WMF and its Turkish partner, the NGO Anadolu Kültür, say <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> on [...] "stabilization and protection" [...] of the cathedral. Turkey's Minister of Culture Ertuğrul Günay stated [...] "We hope that giving new life to the remains of once-splendid buildings, such as the Ani Cathedral and church, will bring new economic opportunities to the region." [...] Armenian officials responded with skepticism. According to Gagik Gyurjyan, president of ICOMOS-Armenia, the Turkish Ministry of Culture rejected the preliminary agreement between Anadolu Kültür and the Armenian side to engage Armenian experts in restoration works. Osman Kavala, president of Anadolu Kültür, stated that the lack of formal bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey may have prevented Armenian experts from being included in the project. Kavala stated in a 2011 interview that an estimated $1 million would be spent on the project, which was scheduled to start in 2012 and end in 4 years. Yavuz Özkaya, an architect who participated in the projects carried out in Ani, stated in March 2014 that studies on preservation and restoration of the cathedral were completed and they had begun to be implemented. These works included clearing the roofs, installing a temporary structure at the separation point between the western and southern walls, strengthening, proper completion of roof tiles and taking preventative measures.|$|E

2500|$|A Working Kelpie {{can be a}} {{cheap and}} {{efficient}} worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock. The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from {{moving away from the}} stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross. [...] They will drive a mob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dogthey can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.|$|E
2500|$|Disincentives: The Tax Relief & Health Care Act of 2006 {{required}} the HHS Inspector General to study ways that Medicare payments to hospitals could be recouped for [...] "never events", {{as defined by}} the National Quality Forum, including hospital infections. In August 2007, CMS announced that it will stop payments to hospitals for several negative consequences of care that result in injury, illness or death. This rule, effective October 2008, would reduce hospital payments for eight serious types of preventable incidents: objects left in a patient during surgery, blood transfusion reaction, air embolism, falls, mediastinitis, urinary tract infections from catheters, pressure ulcer, and sepsis from catheters. Reporting of [...] "never events" [...] and creation of performance benchmarks for hospitals are also mandated. Other private health payers are considering similar actions; in 2005, HealthPartners, a Minnesota health insurer, chose not to cover 27 types of [...] "never events". [...] The Leapfrog Group has announced that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> with hospitals, health plans and consumer groups to advocate reducing payment for [...] "never events", and will recognize hospitals that agree to certain steps when a serious avoidable adverse event occurs in the facility, including notifying the patient and patient safety organizations, and waiving costs. Physician groups involved in the management of complications, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America, have voiced objections to these proposals, observing that [...] "some patients develop infections despite application of all evidence-based practices known to avoid infection", and that a punitive response may discourage further study and slow the dramatic improvements that have already been made.|$|E
2500|$|In early February 2014 Faygoluvers.net {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} Insane Clown Posse, {{and they said that}} they hope <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>work</b> with some artists that they have been wanting to work with for a while. Also they were asked {{if they were going to}} do the second leg of The Mighty Death Pop! Tour, and they said that they will go on tour in 2014 but it won't be called The Mighty Death Pop! Tour. During an interview in March 2014 DJ Paul of Da Mafia 6ix announced that they will be doing a collaboration album with Insane Clown Posse, and will tour to promote the album. In June 2014 Psychopathic Records announced that Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix were working on a collaboration album, and Insane Clown Posse posted pictures on their official instagram page of them and Da Mafia 6ix sitting around in Violent J's home studio. The album is scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. A few days after Faygoluvers.net conducted the interview with Insane Clown Posse, Psychopathic Records, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie released a picture of the Dark Lotus hand sign stating that all original members (Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid & Blaze Ya Dead Homie) were going to be back in the studio recording a new studio album on all their media outlets. Under the hand sign were Roman numerals translating to (7-29-2014). The album will initially be released at the 2014 GOTJ (7/23/2014 - 7/27/2014). In June 2014 Insane Clown Posse announced that they will be releasing their first box set The First Six with all first six Joker Cards (Carnival of Carnage, Ringmaster, Riddle Box, The Great Milenko, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, /), along with a certification of authenticity signed by Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope, 6 tarot cards, and an 8-song EP of all new music titled House of Wax, that will be released on October 28, 2014. In a July 6, 2014 interview Faygoluvers.net conducted with Jumpsteady, he stated that Psychopathic is currently working with some new supergroups. At the 2014 GOTJ during Anybody Killa's seminar, it was announced that he and Big Hoodoo have created a new group called The Have Nots. Insane Clown Posse have composed a group with Da Mafia 6ix called The Killjoy Club, and will be releasing their debut album titled Reindeer Games on September 2, 2014. ICP, DM6, Madchild, Jelly Roll and Mushroom Head plus others are to go on tour possibly titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] which will run from September 18, 2014 - October 31, 2014. ICP finally announced that they will release a Psypher featuring artists that are not signed to Psychopathic Records sometime before Hallowicked, including Madchild. Also announced Otis of AMB and DJ Paul will both release solo albums on Psychopathic records in 2015. On August 5, 2014 ICP released a promo flyer for their upcoming tour titled [...] "ShockFest" [...] with Da Mafia 6ix, Mushroomhead, Madchild and Jelly Roll from September 30, 2014 through October 31, 2014. The tour was originally scheduled to be a 45-date tour, and scheduled to kick off on September 18, 2014, but due to Madchild performing in Australia with his group Swollen Members for a mini tour until September 27, 2014, the tour will now kick off on September 30, 2014 Columbus, Ohio, and will conclude on ICP's 21st annual Hallowicked concert on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. Psychopathic Records released a video promo for [...] "ShockFest" [...] in early August 2014. The tour is now scheduled to run from September 25, 2014, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and will conclude on October 31, 2014, in Detroit, Michigan. In the booklet released with the Reindeer Games album were four flyers in promotion of new albums. The first was for Insane Clown Posse, it said that the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck will be released [...] "sooner than you think". The second was for Otis, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Slaughter and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The third was for DJ Paul, it said that his debut solo album on Psychopathic will be titled Master Of Evil and it said that it too will be released [...] "soon". The fourth was for Da Mafia 6ix, it was for their upcoming album titled [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] which will be released on October 31, 2014, not on Psychopathic Records. In early October 2014 it was announced that [...] "Watch What U Wish" [...] will be pushed back to a 2015 release creating speculation that Psychopathic will release the album. Instead DM6 will release a mixxtape titled Hear Some Evil in October 2014. The First Six was initially scheduled to be released on October 28, 2014, but after a minor setback it is now scheduled to be released on November 25, 2014.
