5|$|Early Neolithic era began around 5500 BCE {{with the}} arrival from the middle Danube area of people, who kept livestock, {{cultivated}} crops, made pottery and smooth-surface tools. Their land tilling predecessors had been coming into the Balkans and then the Danube region from Anatolia beginning a thousand years earlier. <b>They</b> <b>formed</b> the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{crushing}} {{of the two}} revolutions, a number of Brabant and Liège revolutionaries regrouped in Paris, where <b>they</b> <b>formed</b> the joint Committee of United Belgians and Liégois (Comité des belges et liégeois unis), which united revolutionaries from both territories for the first time. Three Belgian corps and a Liège Legion were levied to continue the fight for the French against the Austrians.|$|E

Sikhs mostly live in towns and cities and constitute 1.16% of the state population.

5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast again {{showed that the}} three eastern species formed a natural group, or clade, but they were only distantly related to {{other members of the}} series Banksia. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>formed</b> a sister group to a large group comprising the series Prostratae, Ochraceae, Tetragonae (including Banksia elderiana), Banksia lullfitzii and Banksia baueri.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11f's low {{density is}} {{not shared by}} the planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c because the solar wind has reduced their atmospheres to a thin layer.

50|$|As projectivities {{preserve}} the harmonic relation, <b>they</b> <b>form</b> the automorphisms {{of the real}} projective line. The projectivities are described algebraically as homographies, since the real numbers form a ring, according to the general construction of a projective line over a ring.

5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. <b>They</b> <b>formed</b> when {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer {{at the bottom of}} the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.|$|E

About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where <b>they</b> <b>formed</b> an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum.|$|E
5|$|Some priests' duties {{took them}} beyond the temple precinct. <b>They</b> <b>formed</b> {{part of the}} entourage in festivals that {{traveled}} from one temple to another, and clergies {{from around the country}} sent representatives to the national sed festival that reinforced the king's divine power. Some temples, such as those in the neighboring cities of Memphis and Letopolis, were overseen by the same high priest.|$|E
5|$|This lists {{all of the}} Category5 hurricanes in {{the order}} in which <b>they</b> <b>formed.</b> Only 1994's Hurricane Emilia and 2006's Hurricane Ioke have reached Category5 {{intensity}} more than once; that is, by weakening into a Category4 or weaker storm and later re-strengthening to a Category5 storm.|$|E

The squadron, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch, steamed to the ports of Haifa and Jaffa in July 1877, but found no significant tensions ashore. Batsch then departed and cruised the Mediterranean {{for the remainder of the}} summer, returning to Germany in October.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that <b>they</b> <b>formed</b> {{closer to the}} Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E
