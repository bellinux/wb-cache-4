40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} whether a peripheral size-singleton distractor <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the target-distractor size relation can capture attention and disrupt central target identification. Three experiments consistently {{showed that a}} size singleton <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the target-distractor size relation cannot capture attention when it appears outside of the attentional window, even though the same size singleton produces a cuing effect. In addition, a color singleton <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the target color, instead of a size singleton <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the target-distractor size relation, captures attention when it is outside of the attentional window. Thus, a size-relation-matched distractor is much weaker than a color-matched distractor in capturing attention and cannot capture attention when the distractor appears outside of the attentional window...|$|R

30|$|Manipulations {{performed}} in tuple spaces consist in invocations of three basic operations [4]: out(t) that stores the tuple t in the space; in(t), that removes {{from the space}} a tuple <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the template t; rd(t), used to read from the space a tuple <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the template t, without removing it. Operations in and rd are blocking, i.e., {{if there is no}} tuple <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the template in the space, the process gets blocked until one is available. A common extension to this model is the inclusion of non-blocking variants of these operations, denominated inpn and rdp. These operations work exactly like the previously, except {{by the fact that they}} return even if there is not a tuple <b>that</b> <b>matches</b> the template (indicating its nonexistence).|$|R

At the Hardcore Justice episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys and Team 3D talked about a match involving themselves and The Wolves. When The Wolves were asked by the two teams, they agreed. Later that night, Kurt Angle announced all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with the winners of the first match choosing the stipulation of the next one. The Hardys won the second match of the series on the September 10 episode of Impact Wrestling in a tables match and choose a ladder match for the third match of the series.
