40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a dynamic {{model for a}} novel self-drive pipeline robot or “pig, ” which obtains its power from the kinetic energy of fluid flow in a pipe via a turbine and a reverse– <b>traverse</b> <b>screw</b> mechanism. The new robot is designed to move both against and with the flowing fluid, which makes it different from conventional “pigs, ” which can only move with the flowing fluid. This bidirectional capability makes it very valuable to many in-dustries, especially {{the oil and gas}} industries. Based on the model, the dynamic behavior of the new robot under different conditions has been analyzed in detail. In order to verify the validity of the dy-namic model, a prototype machine and pipe-loop test rig was built, and experimental data obtained compared well with the theoretical analyses. Both the theoretical and experimental results validated the practicability of this novel robot structure. Furthermore, de-tailed analysis has been carried out, and the conclusions that hav...|$|E

The manual warns: [...] "See that the elevating and <b>traversing</b> <b>screws</b> of the guys are always tight. A slack guy leads to inaccurate shooting, and the stresses on firing are not equally distributed; this is usually the cause of the guys breaking".|$|R
5000|$|A {{captured}} Type 97 mortar, {{which has}} been studied in detail, was marked [...] "Type 97 High-Angle Infantry Gun". The weapon was manufactured in 1942 in the Osaka Army Arsenal. Although the Japanese weapon closely resembles the US 81-mm mortar, M1, there are several identifying features by which the two can be distinguished. The adjusting nut of the Japanese mortar {{is on the right}} bipod leg, while the sight is on the left. Other differences are the buttress-type threads on the <b>traversing</b> and elevating <b>screws</b> of the Japanese weapon, as well as the use of welding to fasten bipod legs to the clevis joint and grease fittings dissimilar to those used by the US model.|$|R
40|$|The {{intramedullary}} distal {{locking mechanism}} in the Seidel nail uses interference fit, avoiding {{the need of}} a <b>screw</b> <b>traversing</b> soft tissue {{and the risk of}} neurovascular injury. However, there is concern for its rotational stability. This study was designed to test the rotational stability of the distal locking mechanism under the least stable conditions. A transverse osteotomy was performed 10 cm proximal to the trochlea in 10 cadaveric humeri, followed by insertion of a 9 mm diameter Seidel nail and distally locked. The proximal humeral segments were removed. Rotational test to failure was performed with a material testing machine. The initial medullary diameter and the amount of flange spread measured 9. 95 mm and 11. 28 mm, respectively. Most of the flanges were found to be incompletely deployed. Failure occurred by slippage of the flanges. The average failure torque and torsional stiffness of the nail bone construct tested were 0. 262 N m and 0. 070 N m/°. The Seidel nail distal locking mechanism has low rotational stability on mechanical testing. However, the low failure torque tested in vitro does not always preclude successful fracture healing and a good clinical outcome. Whether the presence of rotational micro motion would be beneficial to bone healing would need further investigation. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|An unusual {{complication}} following partial lateral splint bone ectomy is described. Four {{weeks following}} the surgery, the horse {{fell onto the}} surgery site and {{from that point on}} showed a lameness on that limb. Despite a positive local anesthesia, the re-evaluation did not reveal any abnormal ultrasonographic and radiographic findings. The local steroid injection reduced the lameness only slightly. The clinical evaluation at our clinic revealed the potential presence of a fracture in the lateropalmar cortex. The horse was scheduled for surgery and the special fluoroscopic examination prior to surgery confirmed the tentative diagnosis. The origin of the fracture {{turned out to be the}} horizontal saw cut in the lateropalmar cortex of McIII, which occurred accidentally during the osteotomy of the fractured splint bone. The fall of the horse onto the partially amputated splint bone in association with the horizontal cut in the lateropalmar cortex of McIII, resulted in this avulsion fracture associated with significant pain. The splint bone and the fracture were stabilized with the help of a 9 -hole 3. 5 mm DCP applied over the splint bone and with the <b>screws</b> <b>traversing</b> the entire lateropalmar cortex of McIII. The horse responded positively to this treatment and 10 weeks postoperatively the plate was removed. An additional reason for this relatively early plate removal was the presence of an additional suspensory problem, which demanded a prolonged recovery period...|$|R
40|$|The porcine {{model is}} {{frequently}} used during development and validation of new spinal devices, {{because of its}} likeness to the human spine. These spinal devices are frequently composed of pedicle screws {{with a reputation for}} stable fixation but which can suffer pullouts during preclinical implantation on young animals, leading to high morbidity. With a view to identifying the best choices to optimize pedicle screw fixation in the porcine model, this study evaluates ex vivo the impact of weight (age) of the animal, the level of the vertebrae (lumbar or thoracic) and the type of screw anchorage (mono- or bi-cortical) on pedicle screw pullouts. Among the 80 pig vertebrae (90 - and 140 -day-old) tested in this study, the average screw pullout forces ranged between 419. 9 N and 1341. 2 N. In addition, statistical differences were found between test groups, pointing out the influence of the three parameters stated above. We found that the the more caudally the screws are positioned (lumbar level), the greater their pullout resistance is, moreover, screw stability increases with the age, and finally, the screws implanted with a mono-cortical anchorage sustained lower pullout forces than those implanted with a bi-cortical anchorage. We conclude that the best anchorage can be obtained with older animals, using a lumbar fixation and long <b>screws</b> <b>traversing</b> the vertebra and inducing bi-cortical anchorage. In very young animals, pedicle screw fixations need to be bi-cortical and more numerous to prevent pullout...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The authors report {{experience}} with 14 cases where two screws or ′′double insurance′′ screws {{were used for}} transfacetal fixation of each joint for stabilization of the lumbar spinal segment. The anatomical subtleties of the technique of insertion of screws are elaborated. Materials and Methods: During the period March 2011 to June 2014, 14 patients having lumbar spinal segmental instability related to lumbar canal stenosis were treated by insertion of two screws into each articular assembly by transfacetal technique. After a wide surgical exposure, the articular cartilage was denuded and bone chips were impacted into the joint cavity. For screw insertion in an appropriate angulation, the spinous process was sectioned at its base. The screws (2. 8 mm in diameter and 18 mm in length) were inserted into {{the substance of the}} medial or inferior articular facet of the rostral vertebra via the lateral limit of the lamina approximately 6 - 8 mm away {{from the edge of the}} articular cavity. The screws were inserted 3 mm below the superior edge and 5 mm above the inferior edge of the medial (inferior) facets and directed laterally and traversed through the articular cavity into the lateral (superior) articular facet of the caudal vertebra toward and into the region of junction of base of transverse process and of the pedicle. During the period of follow-up all treated spinal levels showed firm bone fusion. There was no complication related to insertion of the screws. There was no incidence of screw misplacement, displacementor implant rejection. Conclusions: Screw insertion into the firm and largely cortical bones of facets of lumbar spine can provide robust fixation and firm stabilization of the spinal segment. The large size of the facets provides an opportunity to insert two screws at each spinal segment. The firm and cortical bone material and absence on any neural or vascular structure in the course of the <b>screw</b> <b>traverse</b> provides strength and safety to the process...|$|R
