25|$|In {{boundary}} scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs {{on the board}} form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) standard. The JTAG test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical <b>test</b> <b>probes.</b> JTAG tool vendors provide various types of stimulus and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.|$|E
2500|$|Measurement of low {{resistance}} requires lead resistance (measured by touching the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> together) to be subtracted for best accuracy. This {{can be done}} with the [...] "delta", [...] "Zero", or [...] "null" [...] feature of many digital multimeters.|$|E
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} can use {{many different}} <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> {{to connect to}} the circuit or device under test. Crocodile clips, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. [...] Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.|$|E

40|$|Methods and {{instruments}} for characterizing a material, {{such as the}} properties of bone in a living human subject, using a <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> constructed for insertion into the material and a reference probe aligned with the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> in a housing. The housing is hand held or placed so that the reference probe contacts {{the surface of the}} material under pressure applied either by hand or by the weight of the housing. The <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> is inserted into the material to indent the material while maintaining the reference probe substantially under the hand pressure or weight of the housing allowing evaluation of a property of the material related to indentation of the material by the probe. Force can be generated by a voice coil in a magnet structure to the end of which the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> is connected and supported in the magnet structure by a flexure, opposing flexures, a linear translation stage, or a linear bearing. Optionally, a measurement unit containing the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> and reference probe is connected to a base unit with a wireless connection, allowing in the field material testing...|$|R

2500|$|Unpopulated {{boards are}} usually bare-board tested for [...] "shorts" [...] and [...] "opens". A short is a {{connection}} between two points {{that should not be}} connected. An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected. For high-volume production a fixture or a rigid needle adapter makes contact with copper lands on the board. The fixture or adapter is a significant fixed cost and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production flying probe testers are used where <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The CAM system instructs the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.|$|E
5000|$|When an ESR meter {{is used as}} a milliohmmeter, any {{significant}} inductance present between the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> will make measurements meaningless. For example, an ESR meter is unsuitable for measuring resistance in transformer windings because of their inductive characteristics. This effect is significant enough that <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> with coiled cords should not be used due to their inductance.|$|E

5000|$|The {{signaling}} on high-speed serial buses like PCI Express, Fibre Channel 10-Gbit/s Ethernet, InfiniBand or Intel®’s QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) is {{very sensitive}} to capacitive coupling effects. As a result, placing a test pad {{on one of these}} buses to provide access to the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> that external instruments such as oscilloscopes and in-circuit test systems rely on will disrupt the integrity of signals on the underlying bus. As a result, today’s best practices for designing circuit boards call for the elimination of test pads, which restricts the use of <b>test</b> <b>probes.</b> The alternative is embedded instruments which are able to test from the inside out.|$|E

50|$|PIN diodes are {{sometimes}} {{used as input}} protection devices for high frequency <b>test</b> <b>probes.</b> If the input signal is within range, the PIN diode has little impact as a small capacitance.

5000|$|A faulty {{short-circuited}} capacitor will incorrectly {{be identified}} by an ESR meter as having ideally low ESR, but an ohmmeter or multimeter can easily detect this case, which is much rarer in practice than high ESR. It is possible to connect the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> to an ESR meter and ohmmeter in parallel to check for both shorts and ESR in one operation; some meters both measure ESR and detect short-circuits.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{vertical}} <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> is misperceived as slanted in {{the opposite}} direction to an inducer when disparity specifies the inducer slant while monocular cues specify a frontoparallel surface (slant-contrast). In reversed cue conditions with vertical axis slant the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> is misperceived as slanted {{in the same direction as}} the inducer (reversed slant-contrast). We found reliable slant-contrast and reversed slant-contrast with inducers having horizontal-axis slant. The reversed slant-contrast was not influenced when the inducer and probe were separated in the frontal plane or in disparity depth whereas slant contrast was degraded, especially in the latter condition. Slant contrast was most pronounced when the inducer was slanted like a ceiling compared to like a ground. No such difference was found for the reversed slant-contrast. When the cue conflict was minimized slant-contrast was reduced, but only with inducers having ground-like slant. Implications for an existing model explaining the slant effects are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|One type {{of passive}} trimmer uses a {{pressure}} chamber to enable resistor trimming in a single run. The LTCC boards are contacted by <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> on the assembly side and trimmed with a laser beam from the resistor side. This trimming method requires no contact points between the resistances, because the fine pitch adapter contacts the component {{on the opposite side}} of where the trimming occurs. Therefore, the LTCC can be arranged more compactly and less expensively.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{devised a}} method for {{applying}} strain gage testing to determining the stresses placed on circuit boards by the {{hundreds or thousands of}} <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> used to make electrical contact therewith. [...] This is useful because each test probe (a.k.a. [...] "pogo pin") exerts several ounces of force on the DUT (Device Under Test). When the test fixture has thousands of <b>test</b> <b>probes,</b> the sum of the individual probe forces can reach hundreds of pounds. Such force is sufficient to deform the DUT (a printed circuit board, for example) {{to the point where the}} attached inflexible electronic component packages (such as Ball Grid Arrays) may fracture, or their solder joints may fail. Strain gage testing can reveal areas on the DUT where these net forces are excessive when the DUT is clamped into the test fixture, thus showing where supports must be added to the opposite side of the test fixture to counteract the test probe forces. Where a support counteracts the test probe forces, the test probe force is converted from a deformative force distorting the DUT to a compressive force, squeezing the DUT circuit board without deforming its generally planar shape.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soldering}} {{process that}} forms the bead probe leaves a coating of flux. Depending on the manufacturing process used, this flux can have varying levels of hardness. Flux with a waxy hardness can reduce the deformation force from the bead, preventing proper contact with the test probe during the first pass contact. This becomes less of an issue on subsequent contacts as the flux is displaced. <b>Test</b> <b>probes</b> with serrated ends of an appropriate size can also aid in measuring bead probes where flux is an issue.|$|E
