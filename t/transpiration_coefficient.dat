40|$|Programmed {{nutrient}} addition with {{a constant}} relative addition rate has been advocated as a suitable research technique for inducing steady state nutrition in exponentially growing plants. Transpiration controlled nutrient supply is proposed {{as an alternative}} technique for plants with a short or no exponential growth phase. A two-weeks experiment with transpiration controlled nitrogen supply to Pennisetum americanum was carried out to evaluate this method. After an adaptation phase a constant plant N-concentration was maintained, while the relative growth rate decreased rapidly. The <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> was almost constant in time and insensitive to moderate N-stress, but increased sharply when plant N-concentration dropped below 1760 mmol/kg DW. Relative growth rate and nitrogen productivity showed a steep decline at the lowest N concentrations (about 1000 mmol/kg DW). Nitrogen productivity was optimal at about 1760 mmol/kg DW. The results show that transpiration controlled nutrient supply is applicable in research and gives accurate results in growth analysis. When the <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> is known, the nutrient solution can be adjusted to give any desired plant N-concentration, except for the lowest concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{barriers}} along {{contour lines}} are an appropriate measure for runoff management. An {{essential element of}} their design is minimisation of competition for water between the agricultural crop and the vegetation barrier. This requires the evapotranspiration of the vegetation barrier to be known. In 1998 FAO (the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations) presented a method to estimate the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation. The method includes a dual crop coefficient approach, distinguishing soil evaporation and canopy transpiration. The <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{can be obtained from}} either the LAI (leaf area index) or the fractional ground cover. This paper reports the results of a study conducted in Burkina Faso in 1998. Transpiration coefficients of three vegetation barriers were obtained by directly measuring transpiration and soil evaporation during the mid-season growing stage. Measured values were compared with those obtained from the FAO estimation method, using both the LAI and the ground cover approach. In most cases the FAO approach overestimated the <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient.</b> To overcome overestimation FAO proposes a reduction factor based on the stomatal resistance of vegetation with high stomatal control. This factor is difficult to obtain, however, and complicates the relatively simple method of estimation. Even if this reduction factor is taken into account, an overestimation of transpiration coefficients when using the LAI approach should still be acknowledged...|$|E

In recent years, some of trees of Mongolian pine plantations in the sandy lands have been found to be degraded. Study of foliartraits is key to understanding the adaptability and survival strategy of this tree species on sandy land. Our major objective is to examine the impact of needle age on the main eco-physiological foliar traits of Mongolian pine in Horqin sandy land and thus to highlight the importance of needle age for coping with water and nutrients in the semi-arid area. Methods We chose trees of Mongolian pine planted in early 1980 s on a sand dune in the southern margin of Horqin sandy land, located in the permanent experimental plot of the Naiman Desertification Research Station, Cold and Arid Regions Environment and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (42 ° 55 ′ N， 120 ° 43 ′ E). We measured foliar photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, carbon content, nitrogen content and morphological parameters (leaf length, width and thickness) for different-age needles. Based on these measurements we calculated <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Kc) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE). Important findings Net photosynthetic rate (Pn), Kc and PNUE varied among different needle ages and were significantly lower for 4 -year old needles than 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year old needles. This can be accounted for by foliar nitrogen content, with decrease in nitrogen leading to the decline in photosynthesis. Strong correlations were found between foliar form (e. g., leaf length, width, thickness and specific leaf area) and precipitation of the year prior to leaf formation and between foliar carbon content and precipitation of the year prior to leaf formation. In terms of <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> and PNUE, juvenile needles (mainly 1 - and 2 -year old needles) were more efficient in using water and nutrients than old needles (4 -year old needles), and hence a tradeoff between juvenile and old needles in water and nutrient use is a mechanism for growth and survival of Mongolian pine on sandy land. In addition, shedding old leaves under environmental stresses, as we observed in the field, has significant implication for this species to adapt to harsh habitat in the semi-arid area...|$|E

The start of the rainy season and distribution of rainfall were erratic, particularly in the low-altitude regions. As a result, simulated dates of emergence varied from June to August. Moisture stresses of various intensities, at different growth stages of the plant, were limiting to durum wheat production in all the regions except Debre Markos. Terminal moisture stress was simulated in 7 out of 10 years in all locations except Debre Markos, whereas intermittent stress. was simulated in three locations in 2 out of 10 years. In Metahara rain-fed durum wheat production is not feasible without irrigation. Water use efficiency decreased with decreasing rainfall but the <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> increased.

The new bioenergy plant Igniscum Candy is a cultivar of the Sakhalin Knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis), which {{is characterized by}} a high annual biomass production. For the determination of transpiration-yield relations at the whole plant level we used wicked lysimeters at multiple irrigation levels associated with the soil water availability (25, 35, 70, 100 %) and nitrogen fertilization (0, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha- 1). Leaf transpiration and net photosynthesis were determined with a portable minicuvette system. The maximum mean transpiration rate was 10. 6 mmol m- 2 s- 1 for well-watered plants, while the mean net photosynthesis was 9. 1 μmol m- 2 s- 1. The cumulative transpiration of the plants during the growing seasons varied between 49 l (drought stressed) and 141 l (well-watered) per plant.

40|$|Olive {{trees are}} well {{adapted to the}} Mediterranean-type agro-ecosystems of {{southern}} Portugal and have traditionally been cultivated in areas with no irrigation. According to the 2009 agricultural census, the olive tree cultivation area was around 336, 000 ha, of which 164, 000 ha are in the southern province of Alentejo. In this southern region of semi arid Mediterranean climate where the erratic annual precipitation of around 300 to 550 mm {{is not enough to}} fulfil crop water requirements when needed, summer irrigation is a necessity to prevent crop water stress and ensure profitable yields. Hundreds of high and also very high tree-density hedgerow orchards of the Spanish cultivar Arbequina have recently been established in the region {{to take advantage of the}} European Commission decision 2000 / 406 /CE (Official Journal L 154, 27 / 06 / 2000 P. 0033 - 0033) that allowed the expansion of Portuguese olive tree planting quota to 30, 000 ha of new orchards. With enhanced olive production and yield depending on irrigation water supply and management, estimating hedgerow olive orchard water uptake in southern Portugal and appropriately scheduling irrigation have since been the primary concern of researchers, farmers and water resources managers. The objective of this study was to establish relationships between olive transpiration and crop <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficients</b> of very high tree-density hedgerow orchard grown in Alentejo under well-irrigated treatment A (3. 05 mm d- 1) and sustained deficit irrigation treatment B (2. 12 mm d- 1) regimes, to understand and improve their irrigation management. On both treatments, daily transpiration at the stand scale (mm day- 1) was obtained by sap flow and by dividing the tree transpiration by the area of the planting pattern. The results were compared to the daily outputs obtained with the Penman-Monteith “big leaf” equation coupled with the Orgaz et al. (2007) specific model of bulk daily canopy conductance (Gc) for unstressed olive canopies. With the Willmott index of agreement IA and the root-mean-square error RMSE above 0. 8 and below 0. 4 mm d- 1, respectively (Willmott, 1982), the synthetic model proved sufficiently precise to be used as an appropriate simulation tool for predicting olive stand transpiration for the region.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of crop water use {{is critical for}} accurate irrigation scheduling and water licenses. However, the direct measurement of crop water use is too expensive and time consuming to be performed under all possible conditions, which necessitates the use of water use models. The FAO- 56 procedure is a simple, convenient and reproducible method, but as canopy cover and height vary greatly among different orchards, crop coefficients may not be readily transferrable from one orchard to another. Allen and Pereira (2009) therefore incorporated a procedure into the FAO- 56 approach which estimates crop coefficients based on a physical description of the vegetation and an adjustment for relative crop stomatal control over <b>transpiration.</b> <b>Transpiration</b> crop <b>coefficients</b> derived using this procedure and fixed values for citrus, did not provide good estimates of water use in three citrus orchards. However, when mean monthly leaf resistance was taken into account, good agreement was found with measured values.

We evaluate the model by examining key macroscopic properties such as temperature, density and pressure, in a couple classical benchmark problems namely thermal Couette and thermal transpiration problems.

We have found that while the extended Maxwell model, that is, the Maxwell model with three accommodation coefficients, is in general more accurate than the classical Maxwell model, {{the differences in the}} magnitudes of the predicted macroscopic quantities are quite small except the pressure profile of the thermal Couette problem, in which case the classical Maxwell model predicts a pressure trend that is opposite to that predicted by both the extended Maxwell model and the hybrid MD/DSMC simulations. This fact is also demonstrated in our study of the thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> gamma.

The reference solutions are obtained from a validated hybrid DSMC-MD algorithm developed in-house. It has been found that while both models predict temperature and density reasonably well in the Fourier thermal problem, the pressure profile obtained from Maxwell model exhibits a trend that opposes that from the reference solution. As a consequence, the Maxwell model is unable to predict the orientation change of the Knudsen force acting on a cold cylinder embedded in a hot cylindrical enclosure at a certain Knudsen number. In the simulation of the thermal <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> although all three models overestimate the coefficient, the coefficient obtained from CL model is the closest to the reference solution.

40|$|The use {{of remote}} sensing for obtaining {{evapotranspiration}} (ET) from natural and agricultural surfaces is already widely used. For irrigated agriculture the two basic approaches are: (1) {{the solution of}} the energy balance equation, using remotely sensed surface temperatures and reflectances to estimate variables and components of this equation, and (2) the crop coefficient and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) approach where the crop coefficient is obtained through canopy reflectance measurements. For the latter, theoretical and field studies have shown that satellite reflectance-derived vegetation indices (VIs) are closely relate to carbon and moisture fluxes and, when combined with ground data or appropriately calibrated models, they can produce valuable estimates of crop transpiration and related processes at the canopy or ecosystem scale (D ́Urso and Calera, 2006). In this study the crop coefficient approach was used. For estimation of actual transpiration of irrigated and very high tree-density hedgerow orchards grown in Alentejo the procedure correlates (a) the basal crop <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Kcb = Tmax/ETo) of the unstressed full irrigated treatment to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values assessed from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ (r 2 = 0. 86) and (b) the crop stress coefficient (Ks = Ta/KcbETo), obtained from the ratio of the sustained deficit irrigation (Ta) and fully irrigated (Tmax) daily transpiration rates, to a plant stress indicator, in the case, the basal leaf water potential (r 2 = 0. 85). Daily tree transpiration rates on both treatments were obtained from sap flow measurements. The unstressed crop status of the full irrigation treatment was warranted from the high Willmott index of agreement (IA = 0. 88) obtained with transpiration values simulated with the Penman-Monteith “big leaf” model (Willmott, 1982). In this algorithm, a specific model of bulk daily canopy conductance (Gc) for unstressed olive canopies was used (Orgaz et al., 2007). From the resulting relationship equations, known field values of leaf basal water potential and satellite-derived NDVI ́s suffice to get estimates of Ks and Kcb, respectively and from them derive and map the actual olive tree transpiration (Ta = Kcb Ks ETo) rates.

40|$|Aiming at {{simulating}} micro gas flows with accurate boundary conditions, {{an efficient}} hybrid algorithmis developed by combining themolecular dynamics (MD) method with the direct simulationMonte Carlo (DSMC) method. The efficiency {{comes from the}} fact that theMD method is applied only within the gas-wall interaction layer, characterized by the cut-off distance of the gas-solid interaction potential, to resolve accurately the gas-wall interaction process, while the DSMC method is employed in the remaining portion of the flow field to efficiently simulate rarefied gas transport outside the gas-wall interaction layer. A unique feature about the present scheme is that the coupling between the two methods is realized by matching the molecular velocity distribution function at the DSMC/MD interface, hence there is no need for one-toone mapping between a MD gas molecule and a DSMC simulation particle. Further improvement in efficiency is achieved by taking advantage of gas rarefaction inside the gas-wall interaction layer and by employing the "smart-wall model" proposed by Barisik et al.

To assure that treatment A was well-watered, we compared field daily ETc values against ETc obtained with the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation incorporating the Orgaz et al. (2007) bulk daily canopy conductance (gc) model, validated for our non-limiting conditions. We then tested the hypothesis of indirectly monitoring olive ETc from readily available vegetation index (VI) and ground-based plant water stress indicator. In the process we used the FAO 56 dual crop coefficient (Kc) approach. For the HI olive trees we defined Kcb as the basal <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and we related Kcb to remotely sensed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) through a Kcb-SAVI functional relationship.

40|$|Water {{requirements}} of evergreen citrus orchards in semi-arid {{regions of the}} world are mostly met through irrigation. Definitive knowledge of crop water use is the fundamental basis for sound water management under these production systems. The objectives of this study were two-fold: i) to measure long-term transpiration of well managed micro-irrigated citrus orchards and; ii) to test physically–based models {{that can be used to}} predict transpiration across different citrus growing regions. Whole tree transpiration measurements were conducted using the heat ratio method (HRM) sap flow technique in two well-irrigated citrus orchards [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] in the summer rainfall area of South Africa. The two orchards planted with 'Delta' Valencia and 'Bahianinha' Navel orange trees were located at Moosrivier Farm in Groblersdal. A data set from an orchard planted with 'Rustenburg' Navel orange trees that was located in the winter rainfall area was sourced for model validation. The orchard was located at Patrysberg Farm in the winter rainfall area. All the orchards were drip irrigated and managed according to the industry standards. Weather parameters were monitored using automatic weather stations that were situated close to the fields, for modelling purposes. The HRM was initially calibrated against eddy covariance measurements in winter (31 July to 3 August 2008) and autumn (21 to 25 May 2009) in the 'Delta' Valencia orchard, when soil evaporation was considered negligible. Calibration was done by adjusting the wounding width to ensure that average transpiration of sample trees matched crop evapotranspiration (ETc) measured above the orchard using the eddy covariance method. The wounding width, termed the 'virtual wound width', was obtained by inputting ETc into regression equations of daily transpiration against wound width. Xylem anatomical assessments were conducted on excised stem samples prior to probe insertion and at the conclusion of sap flow measurements in in order to ascertain and explain the virtual wound width determined through calibration. The average virtual wound width that matched average transpiration of sample trees to ETc in both winter and autumn was 3. 2 mm. The similarity of the virtual wound width obtained during winter and autumn suggests that wounding did not increase with time and a single field calibration of the HRM using eddy covariance measurements is sufficient for measuring long term transpiration in citrus orchards. The HRM was used to measure transpiration for periods of 364 days in the 'Delta' Valencia orchard, 301 days in the 'Bahianinha' Navel orchard and 365 days in the 'Rustenburg' Navel orchard. Average transpiration in the 'Delta' Valencia orchard was 1. 15 mm day- 1 and 2. 17 mm day- 1 in winter and summer, respectively. On average, 'Bahianinha' Navel orange trees transpired 0. 77 mm day- 1 and 1. 69 mm day- 1 in winter and summer, respectively. In the 'Rustenburg' Navel orchard average transpiration was 2. 26 mm day- 1 for summer and 2. 08 mm day- 1 for winter. Total transpiration measured in the 'Delta' Valencia, 'Bahianinha' and 'Rustenburg' Navel orchards was 650, 433 and 682 mm, respectively. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Kt) determined in the three orchards ranged between 0. 28 and 0. 71. The Kt values were almost constant throughout the seasons in the summer rainfall area and significantly higher in the winter months than in the summer months in the winter rainfall area. Derived monthly and seasonal Kt determined for the three orchards were much lower than the standardised values published in the FAO 56. Differences among the <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficients</b> determined in the orchards in this study means that they are orchard specific and can therefore not be directly applied or transferred to different growing {{regions of the world}}. There is a need to develop an easy method for estimating site-specific crop coefficients, in order to improve water management in citrus orchards. The determination of basal crop coefficients based on physical characteristics of the vegetation and an adjustment for relative crop stomatal control over transpiration formulated by Allen and Pereira (2009) was tested. Use of the parameters for generic citrus trees suggested by the authors did not provide good estimates of transpiration in the three study orchards. A good agreement between measured and estimated Kt values was obtained by back-calculating leaf resistances using measured transpiration values, as recommended by Allen and Pereira (2009). The values of leaf resistances obtained through this procedure were higher than the values suggested by Allen and Pereira (2009), but comparable to those reported in literature and measured in the 'Rustenburg' navel orchard. A relationship between mean monthly leaf resistance and ETo in the 'Rustenburg' Navel orchard provided a means of estimating mean leaf resistance which estimated Kt values with a reasonable degree of accuracy in the three orchards. However, this relationship only provided good seasonal estimates of transpiration, which means that it can only be useful for irrigation planning. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

Experimental evidence suggested that assimilate partitioning favouring the root system, was a significant reason why yields were not higher. Other factors analysed were N 2 fixation, NPK fertilization, plant density decline, cultivar differences and weed infestation. Photosynthetis measurements on artificial swards are also presented. Potato yields of 80 t/ha were recorded. Very high growth rates of 270 kg/ha. d were obtained with the local andigena cultivar, but growth duration was shorter and harvest index lower than those obtained in temperate regions. Results of a line source sprinkler irrigation experiment indicated low <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficients,</b> but also large irrigation losses due to a low uptake capacity of the roots.

Both C 4 crops, maize and Rhodes grass, demonstrated high growth rates during summer, but dramatic declines in the other seasons, probably due to cold nights. For high production, ample N supply is of paramount importance. Data concerning NPK concentrations and leaf area index are given for both C 4 crops. Maize growth was also strongly hampered by mechanical resistance of sandy desert soils, but on clay loam very high growth rates of 500 kg/ha. d were reached. Hybrids from other sources and maize grown in a warmer environment at sea level, showed slightly higher initial growth but at the expense of final yield. The simulation model BACROS predicted the growth of maize and Rhodes grass during summer very well, but during the other seasons the simulations were too high as permanent damage to photosynthetic capacity due to low night temperatures was not taken into account. The very high growth rates of maize on clay loam could not be simulated by the model either. For the latter phenomenon and for the influence of mechanical soil resistance, model adaptations are presented and resulting simulations discussed. The model PHOTON both under- and over-estimated the photosynthesis measured on artificial swards of alfalfa. The simulation model ARID CROP was adapted to an alfalfa cutting management model that simulated reasonably accurately above and below- ground growth and reserve levels measured in S. Peru, at different cutting intervals from 21 to 53 days. Main factors influencing regional irrigated crop production and usefulness of simulation for agriculture in developing countries are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Subtropical fruit crops form an {{important}} part of the fruit industry in many countries. Many of these crops are grown in semi-arid regions or subtropical regions where rainfall is seasonal and as a result the vast majority of these perennial, evergreen orchards are under irrigation. This represents a significant irrigation requirement and with more emphasis being placed on the conservation of water and orchard profitability, it is becoming increasingly important to accurately estimate water use of these crops and schedule irrigation accordingly. The FAO- 56 procedure is a simple, convenient and reproducible method for estimating water use. However, the transferability of crop coefficients between different orchards and growing regions is not always readily achieved, due largely to differences in canopy size and management practices. In addition, as subtropical crops tend to exhibit a higher degree of stomatal control over transpiration than most other agricultural crops, some measure of canopy or leaf resistance must be taken into account when using models based on atmospheric demand. The challenge is therefore to provide reliable and dynamic estimates of canopy resistance from relatively simple parameters which can be of use to irrigation consultants and farmers for determining the water requirements of these crops. The challenge remains to ensure that these dynamic estimates are realistic and readily applicable to a number of growing regions. The derivation of <b>transpiration</b> crop <b>coefficients,</b> based on canopy cover and height and a dynamic estimate of leaf resistance, provided reasonable estimates of transpiration in three orchards in contrasting climates, suggesting that this approach could prove useful in future for subtropical crops.

Experimental field surveys were conducted on the flood plain of the river Iput in 2009 – 2014. These years were characterized by different phytoclimatic conditions. The amounts of daily values of radiation balance {{for the period of}} vegetation in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014 constituted respectively 1127, 1126, 1181, 1157 MDzh/m 2 whereas during 2009 and 2011 respectively they came to 963 and 915 MDzh/m 2. The maximum daily values for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were observed in 2012 and 2013 and constituted respectively 764 and 710  MDzh/m 2, the minimum – in 2009 and 2011 – constituted respectively 635 and 592 MDzh/m 2. During the vegetation period from the first hay crop to the second higher values of radiation balance and PAR were observed than during the period up to the first hay crop. Despite differences in the productivity between different variants of the cultures, a directly proportional linear dependence between productivity and transpiration with a high coefficient of correlation was obtained for every year of the research and stage of the hay crop. The <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> for bluegrass herbs which are grown in river flood plains is established for the first time. The transpiraton coefficient doesn’t depend on the type of dose and ratio between different fertilizers, nor on the method of preparing the soil. The transpiration coefficient of crops of bluegrass herbs doesn’t depend on doses and a type of the introduced fertilizers, the method of handling of the soil, and for the first and second hay crops respectively constituted 469 and 486 per dry weight. The increase in transpirational consumption of moisture in dry weight formation during the period from the first hay crop to the second was caused by decrease in bioavailability of moisture during this period. We established that the crops of bluegrass herbs cultivated on alluvial sandy soil without use of mineral fertilizers don’t use the moisture which is accumulated during the autumn and winter and spring period, and the crops of bluegrass herbs cultivated using mineral fertilizers lack moisture during the vegetation period from first to the second hay crop only in drought years. We have experimentally proved that mineral fertilizers raise the relative transpiration and bioavailability of soil moisture to plants. It is suggested that the soluble salts which are a component of fertilizers increase osmotic pressure in the vascular system of plants. It was proved that preseeding working of the soil with a turnover of the layer at a depth of 20 cm increases bioavailability of soil moisture and absorption of solar radiation during the vegetation period in drought years...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis {{is the impact of}} water deficit on the {{concentration}} of proline and electrolyte leakage from representatives of the Panicoideae tribe. The impact of drought on agricultural production in the environment of the Czech Republic is currently an important issue. The exceptionall dry year of 2014 / 2015 and the associated water deficit in the soil had an impact mainly on the harvest of wide-row crops, including maize. Representatives of the Panicoideae tribe - sorghum and foxtail millet are the most drought-resistance crops in the world. Sorghum and foxtail millet belong to II. group of cereals like maize. Sorghum and foxtail millet show lower <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient</b> than maize, they also tolerates less demanding growing conditions and are more resistant to diseases and pests. They also compete with maize {{in a wide range of}} applications. It is therefore appropriate to determine how these crops respond to water deficit during their ontogenetic development. For the purposes of this experiment genotypes originating from conditions of temperate climate were selected, this genotypes have a shorter growing season. A short growing season is an important factor in the timing of the harvest of the late sown crops in our climate. The aim of the thesis was to determine and evaluate the impact of water deficit on the concentration of proline and electrolyte leakage in selected genotypes of sorghum and foxtail millet and on the basis of the results to select genotypes with high resistance to water deficit. Based on the aims the following hypotheses were set: to determine whether there are differences in the concentration of proline and electrolyte leakage between selected genotypes depending on the effect of water deficit and whether there are differences in these physiological characteristics in response to water deficit between sorghum and foxtail millet. To fulfill the objectives and evaluation the hypothesis was based on the greenhouse experiment with selected genotypes of sorghum and foxtail millet at the Department of Botany and Plant Physiology in the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. The experiment included 4 genotypes of the species Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. (Sorghum) : 1216, 30485, Barnard Red and Ruzrok and one variety of the species Setaria italica (L.) Beauv. (Foxtail millet) Ruberit. A total of 4 variants were designated for the experiment (one control and three under the influence of water deficit in different times). The plants in the control variant were full irrigated throughout the experiment. Variant KS was irrigated for the first 14 days, followed by 10 days without watering and the last 4 days were again irrigated. Plants in variant SK were under the influence of water deficit for the first 10 days of the experiment, then 18 days with watering and the plants in the variant SS were without watering for the first 10 days, for the next 4 days were without watering, then the same pattern was repeated: 10 days without and 4 days with watering. Physiological characteristics were observed in plants in the developmental stages BBCH 14 - 16. The concentration of proline was determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples formed by the reaction with ninhydrin. Subsequently, the measured values were compared with the calibration curve. To measure the sample absorbance at 520 nm a spectrophotometer Hellios gama (Thermo) was used. Electrolyte leakage on discs made from leafs was measured with electrical conductivity meter GRYF 158 (HB Griffin, Ltd.). The obtained results show that the proline concentration increased in response to water stress, since the highest concentration of proline was detected in plants growing in the most stressed variant of SS (670. 13 micrograms) compared with other variants of stress. Plants variant KS (643. 85 micrograms) showed a higher accumulation than the proline in variant SK (636. 69 micrograms). The highest concentration of proline was measured on a genotype in the variety of sorghum Ruzrok (642. 94 micrograms). The lowest content of proline was found in the variety of sorghum 1216 (623. 78 micrograms), this value was also the only significant difference from the contents of proline to other genotypes. Which at least partly confirms the proposed hypothesis that there are differences in the content of proline between genotypes. The highest electrolyte leakage cell damage was respectively exhibited in plants from the variant SS (39. 56 %). Plants of the SK variant showed a higher rate of cell damage (32. 95 %) than plants from the variant KS (29. 88 %). The lowest cell damage was exhibited in plants grown under control conditions, which again indicates that damage cells increases in response to water deficit. In this experiment the highest degree of cell damage was found in the variety of sorghum 1216 (29. 26 %) and lowest cell damage was observed in the variety of sorghum Ruzrok (27. 03 %). A significant different degree of cell damage appeared only in the variety foxtail millet Ruberit (28. 6 %), which confirms our hypothesis that there are differences in the electrolyte leakage between sorghum and foxtail millet. The hypotheses were not fully confirmed by the experiment. Nevertheless, on the basis of obtained results we conclude that the least drought-resistance genotype is the 1216 variety and the best adapted to the water deficit was the Ruzrok variety. It also confirmed that the higher proline accumulation may protect the plant against the negative effects of water deficit on the cell membranes, which is then reflected in a reduced electrolyte leakage...|$|E

Recentes estudos mostram que a área irrigada de citrus no Estado tem aumentado signicativamente nos últimos 5 anos. Porém, as limitações dos recursos hídricos e falta de informações sobre o manejo eficiênte da irrigação na cultura do citrus são os principais problemas face aos produtores. Visando atender essa necessidade, este projeto teve como objetivos determinar a evapotranspiração de uma planta jovem de limeira ácida Tahiti (Citrus latifolia Tan.) e os coeficientes de cultivo durante a formação de um pomar. Considerando a independente contribuicão da evaporação do solo e transpiração da cultura pela substituição do coeficente de cultivo (Kc=ETc/ETo) em dois separados coeficientes; Ke, um coeficiente de evaporação de água do solo e Kcb, um coeficiente de transpiração da cultura. Avaliar o desenvolvimento vegetativo, assim como aspectos produtivos da cultura, frente a diferentes níveis de irrigação, com o fornecimento crescente de 25 a 100 % da necessidade hídrica da cultura. O experimento foi realizado na ESALQ/ USP em Piracicaba - SP, em uma área irrigada por gotejamento, com plantas espaçadas de 7 x 4 metros entre linhas e plantas respectivamente, sendo que cada planta foi atendida por 4 pontos de molhamento no solo distribuídos de forma eqüidistantes entre si. Foi avaliado o desenvolvimento vegetativo das plantas, com base em medidas de diâmetro do caule, altura e sistema radicular. Foi realizado o monitoramento climático utilizando estação meteorológica automatizada e a obtenção da evapotranspiração da cultura por lisímetro de pesagem. Durante o período de estudo, Kc variou entre 0, 6 a 1, 22, e Kcb variou entre 0, 4 a 1, 0. Os resultados mostraram que a independente influência da evaporação do solo e transpiração é importante para melhor compreensão sobre o consumo de água de plantas jovens de lima ácida Tahiti, quando comparado a plantas adultas. Os maiores consumos foram observados no verão. A reposição de 100 % da água evapotranspirada resultou em melhor desenvolvimento vegetativo de plantas jovens de limeira acida Tahiti em condições de campo. Os resultados mostraram também que não houve diferenças entre as lâminas quanto à distribuição das raízes, de plantas jovens (33 meses) em profundidade, concentrando-se na camada de 0, 0 - 0, 3 m. Entretanto, a distribuição {{horizontal}} foi maior nos níveis baixos (0 %; 25 % e 50 %) do que nos maiores níveis (75 % e 100 %). Nas plantas irrigadas com 75 % e 100 % houve concentração das raízes até 0, 6 m, indicando que o déficit hídrico induziu o crescimento na direção horizontal. E que a profundidade e distância horizontal efetiva das raízes, de plantas com 48 meses, localizam-se a 0, 6 m de profundidade. Os resultados mostraram que a irrigação induziu à precocidade da produção e ao aumento da produtividade e do número de frutos nas plantas jovens de lima ácida Tahiti já a partir da lâmina de 25 % da evapotranspiração da cultura. Quanto à qualidade de frutos, não houve diferença significativa entre os níveis de irrigação avaliados. The State of São Paulo {{is one of}} {{the most}} important producers of citrus of the world. Recent studies showed that during the last 5 years, there was a significant increase in the area with citrus irrigation. However, the shortage of water and the unavailability of required information for efficient irrigation scheduling are the main problems that producers face. Therefore, the objective of this work was an estimate water requirement of young Tahiti lime orchards considering the independent contributions from soil evaporation and crop transpiration by splitting the crop coefficient (Kc=ETc/ETo) into two separate coefficients; Ke, a soil evaporation coefficient and Kcb, a crop <b>transpiration</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Evaluate the effect of different irrigation levels (0 to 100 % of crop evapotranspiration by weighing lysimeter) on Tahiti acid lime young tree canopy and root growth, productivity and quality of fruit, under drip irrigation in the field. The experiment was conducted during a 3 -yr period (August 2002  May 2005) in a 1. 0 ha plot planted with Tahiti acid lime trees, grafted on Swingle citrumelo rootstock. The trees were 1 -yr old at planting, spaced 7 x 4 m. The orchard was located in Piracicaba, São Paulo State, Brazil. Each treatment was assigned to different irrigation level, based on ETc as determined by a weighing lysimeter. The trunk diameter and height tree were evaluated monthly. The roots were evaluated when the trees were 30 and 48 months old. Adopted during the first root sampling were 4 horizontal distances from the tree trunk (0. 3, 0. 6, 0. 9 and 1. 2 m) and 2 depths (0. 0 - 0. 3 and 0. 3 - 0. 6 m). Adopted during the second sampling were 5 horizontal distances from trunk (0. 3, 0. 6, 0. 9, 1. 2 and 1. 5 m), and 3 depths (0. 0 - 0. 3, 0. 3 - 0. 6 and 0. 6 - 0. 9 m). The yield was evaluated by measuring weight and number of fruits per tree in 2004 and 2005. The quality of the yield was evaluated by measuring fruit diameter, rind thickness, % of juice, total soluble solids, pH and total acidity. During the study period, Kc varied between 0. 6 to 1. 22, and Kcb varied between 0. 4 to 1. 0. The independent influence of soil evaporation and transpiration is important to better understand the water consumption of young lime tree during the growth, compared to mature lime tree. The biggest ETc and Kc were observed on summer. The results showed that young trees irrigated with 100 % ETc resulted in greater growth. The results also showed that did not happen differences in root distribution in the depths, most of them at 0 - 0. 3 m. However, the horizontal distribution at lower levels (25 and 50 %) of that in the biggest levels (75 and 100 %) that concentrated at 0. 6 m, indicating that water stress induced the root growth horizontally. The results, at the second analysis, showed that did not happen differences in root distribution soil profile, and effective depth and horizontal distance of root located to 0. 6 m of depth and 0. 6 of horizontally distant of tree. Finally, the irrigation induced precocity of production, increase of productivity and the fruits number already with irrigation of 25 % of ETc.

Under medium stress (40 % plant available water) the plants maintained a similar stem shape, although they grew at lower rate (stem length: 0. 28 ± 0. 11 cm day- 1; dry biomass production: 0. 64 ± 0. 18 g day- 1). Seedlings under extreme drought stress (no irrigation) stopped growing, started shedding leaves and showed shrinking stem diameter from the 12 th day {{after the start of}} the drought treatment. The drought treatment did not influence the wood density (0. 26 g cm- 3). The root/shoot ratio of the wet treatment was 0. 27, which is low compared to other tropical trees. Both the biomass allocation and root/shoot were significantly influenced by drought. Plants of the different accessions were uniform in biomass production and plant traits.

With the espousal of the measured data for individual species, including coverage, stomatal resistance, photosynthetic photon flux density, canopy light interception, leaf area index, plant height, and other within and above-canopy biophysical properties, we scaled up stomatal resistance to canopy resistance to quantify TRT rates of individual specie. The evaporation rates from the riparian zone were also quantified. We developed mixed riparian vegetation evapotranspiration crop <b>coefficients</b> and <b>transpiration</b> crop <b>coefficients</b> for individual species. ^ The total ETa from mixed plant community was 679 mm in 2009 and 982 mm in 2010.

This requires a sound understanding of crop physiological processes and well tested simulation models. Thus, this experiment on spring wheat aimed to better quantify water x nitrogen effects on wheat by deriving some key crop physiological parameters that have proven useful in simulating crop growth. For spring wheat grown in Northern Australia under four levels of nitrogen (0 to 360 kg N ha− 1) and either entirely on stored soil moisture or under full irrigation, kernel yields ranged from 343 to 719 g m− 2. Yield increases were strongly associated with increases in kernel number (9150 - 19950 kernels m− 2), indicating the sensitivity of this parameter to water and N availability. Total water extraction under a rain shelter was 240 mm with a maximum extraction depth of 1. 5 m. A substantial amount of mineral nitrogen available deep in the profile (below 0. 9 m) was {{taken up by the}} crop. This was the source of nitrogen uptake observed after anthesis. Under dry conditions this late uptake accounted for approximately 50 % of total nitrogen uptake and resulted in high (> 2 %) kernel nitrogen percentages even when no nitrogen was applied. Anthesis LAI values under sub-optimal water supply were reduced by 63 % and under sub-optimal nitrogen supply by 50 %. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) based on total incident short-wave radiation was 1. 34 g MJ− 1 and did not differ among treatments.

Irrigated rice evapotranspiration (ET) {{is composed of}} floodwater evaporation and canopy <b>transpiration.</b> Crop <b>coefficient</b> Kc (ET over potential ET, or ETo) is crop specific according to FAO, but may decrease as CO 2 concentration rises. A sunlit growth chamber experiment was conducted in the Philippines, exposing 1. 44 -m 2 canopies of IR 72 rice to four constant CO 2 levels (195, 390, 780 and 1560 ppmv). Crop geometry and management emulated field conditions. In two wet (WS) and two dry (DS) seasons, final aboveground dry weight (agdw) was measured. At 390 ppmv [CO 2] (current ambient level), agdw averaged 1744 g m- 2, similar to field although solar radiation was only 61 % of ambient. Reduction to 195 ppmv [CO 2] reduced agdw to 56 ± 5 % (SE), increase to 780 ppmv increased agdw to 128 ± 8 %, and 1560 ppmv increased agdw to 142 ± 5 %. In 2013 WS, crop ET was measured by weighing the water extracted daily from the chambers by the air conditioners controlling air humidity. Chamber ETo was calculated according to FAO and empirically corrected via observed pan evaporation in chamber vs. field. For 390 ppmv [CO 2], Kc was about 1 during crop establishment but increased to about 3 at flowering. 195 ppmv CO 2 reduced Kc, 780 ppmv increased it, but at 1560 ppmv it declined. Whole-season crop water use was 564 mm (195 ppmv), 719 mm (390 ppmv), 928 mm (780 ppmv) and 803 mm (1560 ppmv). With increasing [CO 2], crop water use efficiency (WUE) gradually increased from 1. 59 g kg- 1 (195 ppmv) to 2. 88 g kg- 1 (1560 ppmv). Transpiration efficiency (TE) measured on flag leaves responded more strongly to [CO 2] than WUE. Responses of some morphological traits are also reported. In conclusion, increased CO 2 promotes biomass more than water use of irrigated rice, causing increased WUE, {{but it does not}} help saving water. Comparability with field conditions is discussed.

40|$|Introduction: Atmospheric CO 2 {{concentration}} has continuously {{been increasing}} {{during the past}} century and {{it is expected to}} increase from current 384 ppm to 550 ppm in 2050. This increase is expected to increase global temperature by 1. 4 to 5. 8 oC which can have major effects on crop plants. Since both CO 2 and temperature are among the most important environmental variables that regulate physiological and phenological processes in plants, it is critical to evaluate the effects of CO 2 and air temperature on the growth and yield of key crop plants. Warming of Earth's atmosphere can increase dark respiration and photorespiration in C 3 plants. Rate of photosynthesis is affected by temperature, Therefore, rate of biochemical reactions, morphological reactions, CO 2 and energy exchange with the atmosphere could be affected by temperature. Increase in CO 2 concentration causes further yield improvement in C 3 plants (Such as wheat, rice and soybeans) in comparison with C 4 plants (Such as corn, sorghum and sugarcane). In general, increasing CO 2 concentration affects plant processes in two ways:direct effect on physiological processes in plant and indirect effect by changes in temperature and rainfall. Studying climate change effects including increase in temperature and CO 2 concentration can help understanding adaptation strategies to reach higher and sustainable crop yields. Therefore, the objective of this research was {{to examine the effects of}} temperature and CO 2 changes on days to maturity, irrigation water requirement, and yield in soybean under irrigation conditions of Gorganusing SSM-iLegume-Soybean model. Materials and methods: The model SSM-iLegume-Soybean simulates phenological development, leaf development and senescence, crop mass production and partitioning, plant nitrogen balance, yield formation and soil water and nitrogen balances. The model includes responses of crop processes to environmental factors of solar radiation, temperature and nitrogen and water availability. The soybean model was used to run different scenarios including combination of - 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 oC changes in temperature and CO 2 concentration of 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700 ppm. Actual weather data in Gorgan (latitude 37 degrees 45 minutes north, longitude 54 degrees 30 minutes east) of 1980 to 2009 was used as baseline climate and then changed to obtained future temperature climates.

40|$|Correct {{estimation}} of crop actual transpiration plays a key-role in precision irrigation scheduling, since crop growth and yield are associated {{to the water}} passing through the crop. Objective of the work was to assess how the combined use of micro-meteorological techniques (eddy covariance, EC) and physiological measurements (sap flow, SF) allows a better comprehension of the processes involving in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum. To this aim, an experimental dataset of actual evapotranspiration, plant transpiration, and soil water content measurements was collected in an olive orchard during the midseason phenological period of 2009 and 2010. It was demonstrated that the joint use of EC and SF techniques is effective to evaluate the components of actual evapotranspiration in an olive orchard characterized by sparse vegetation and a significant fraction of exposed bare soil. The availability of simultaneous soil water content measurements allowed to estimate the crop coefficients and to assess a simple crop water stress index, depending on actual transpiration that can be evaluated {{even in the absence}} of direct measurements of actual <b>transpiration.</b> The crop <b>coefficients</b> experimentally determined resulted very similar to those previously evaluated; in particular, in the absence of water stress, a seasonal average value of about 0. 65 was obtained for the "single" crop coefficient, whereas values of a 0. 34 and 0. 41 were observed under limited water availability in the root zone. The comparison between the values of crop water stress index evaluated during the investigated periods evidenced systematically lower values (less crop water stress) in the first year compared to the second, according to the general trend of soil waters content in the root zone. Further researches are however necessary to extent the experimental dataset to periods characterized by values of soil evaporation higher than those observed, in order to verify the crop coefficients even under different conditions than those investigated. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{formulation}} {{of a new}} process-based crop model, the general large-area model (GLAM) for annual crops is presented. The model {{has been designed to}} operate on spatial scales commensurate with those of global and regional climate models. It aims to simulate the impact of climate on crop yield. Procedures for model parameter determination and optimisation are described, and demonstrated for the prediction of groundnut (i. e. peanut; Arachis hypogaea L.) yields across India for the period 1966 - 1989. Optimal parameters (e. g. extinction <b>coefficient,</b> <b>transpiration</b> efficiency, rate of change of harvest index) were stable over space and time, provided the estimate of the yield technology trend was based on the full 24 -year period. The model has two location-specific parameters, the planting date, and the yield gap parameter. The latter varies spatially and is determined by calibration. The optimal value varies slightly when different input data are used. The model was tested using a historical data set on a 2. 5 degrees x 2. 5 degrees grid to simulate yields. Three sites are examined in detail-grid cells from Gujarat in the west, Andhra Pradesh towards the south, and Uttar Pradesh in the north. Agreement between observed and modelled yield was variable, with correlation coefficients of 0. 74, 0. 42 and 0, respectively. Skill was highest where the climate signal was greatest, and correlations were comparable to or greater than correlations with seasonal mean rainfall. Yields from all 35 cells were aggregated to simulate all-India yield. The correlation coefficient between observed and simulated yields was 0. 76, and the root mean square error was 8. 4 % of the mean yield. The model can be easily extended to any annual crop for the investigation of the impacts of climate variability (or change) on crop yield over large areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Crop evapotranspiration. Guidelines for computing crop water requirements. FAO Irrig. and Drain. Paper 56. Rome, Italy]. Seasonal evapotranspiration measured in the lysimeter (893. 34 mm) was higher than the seasonal ETc calculated by FAO- 56 method (832. 90 mm). The percentage of GC was found through the supervised classification technique of digital photographic images with the maximum probability algorithm [Calera, A., Martínez, C., Melia, J., 2001. A procedure for obtaining green plant cover: relation to NDVI in a case study for barley. Int. J. Remote Sensing, 22, 3357 - 3362]. The values derived from lysimetric measurements are Kc ini: 0. 65, Kc mid: 1. 20 and Kc end: 0. 75, similar to values given in FAO- 56. Lysimetric measurements showed that the evaporative component was high during the growing season, due to the high frequency of irrigation {{and the fact that the}} onion crop does not completely cover the ground; maximum GC was 72 %. Therefore, the dual crop coefficient was calculated, which allowed differentiation between crop <b>transpiration</b> (basal crop <b>coefficient,</b> Kcb) and evaporation from the soil (evaporation coefficient, Ke). With the aim of facilitating extrapolation of the results to other areas, Kc and Kcb were linearly correlated to fractional GC.

The study site was an open woodland dominated by Eucalyptus crebra F. Muell. (a broad-leaved species) and Callitris glaucophylla J. Thompson & L. A. S. Johnson (a needle-leaved tree species). Tree water use was measured with sapflow sensors and leaf area and sapwood area were measured destructively on felled trees. The Huber value was calculated as the ratio of sapwood area to leaf area. Diameter at breast height (DBH) of the stem {{was used as a}} measure of tree size. Canopy conductance was calculated with an inversion of the Penman–Monteith equation, whereas canopy decoupling) was calculated as described by Lu et al. (2003). The relationship between DBH and daily total water use varied during the four measurement periods, with largest rates of water use observed in summer 2003 – 2004, following a large rainfall event and the smallest maximum water use observed in winter 2003 when monthly rainfall was much less than the long-term mean for those months. Despite differences in the relationship between sapwood area and DBH for the two species, the relationship between daily total water use and DBH did not differ between species at any time. The same rates of water use for the two species across sampling periods arose through different mechanisms; the eucalypt underwent significant changes in leaf area whereas the Callitris displayed large changes in canopy conductance, such that tree water use remained the same for both species during the 2 -year period. Canopy conductance and the decoupling coefficient were both significantly larger in winter than summer in both years. The generally low decoupling coefficient (0. 05 – 0. 34) reflects the low leaf area index of the site. When evaporative demand was small (winter), the degree of stomatal control was small and the decoupling coefficient was large. There was no relationship between tree size and either canopy conductance or the decoupling <b>coefficient.</b> <b>Transpiration</b> rates generally showed little variation between seasons and between species because of the balance between changes in leaf area, canopy conductance and evaporative demand. The occurrence of a significant drought did not appear to prevent these coordinated changes from occurring, with the result that convergence in water use was observed for these two disparate species. 12 page(s...|$|R
