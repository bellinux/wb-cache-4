5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. <b>The</b> <b>plates</b> would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> to be defensive in nature is that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E
5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b> <b>The</b> <b>plates</b> then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> are manifestly chiral and no two plates {{of the same size}} and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E

5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} potential for a thermoregulatory role in <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> to absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E

5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying {{one night in}} 1823.

Smith said he attempted to remove <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without <b>the</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Antarctic <b>Plate</b> is a tectonic <b>plate</b> {{containing}} <b>the</b> {{continent of}} Antarctica and extending outward under the surrounding oceans.

5|$|Although Smith {{had left}} his {{treasure}} hunting company, his former associates believed he had doubled crossed them and taken the golden plates for himself, which they believed should be joint property.

5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused to show <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would}} be allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According to Smith, the angel Moroni took back <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> once Smith finished using them.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{so-called}} Drake's <b>Plate</b> of Brass is a forgery that {{purports to}} be the brass plaque that Francis Drake posted upon landing in Northern California in 1579. The hoax was successful for forty years, despite early doubts. After <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> came to public attention in 1936, historians immediately raised questions regarding <b>the</b> <b>plate's</b> wording, spelling, and manufacture. The hoax's perpetrators even tried to tip off <b>the</b> <b>plate's</b> finders as to its origins. But many presumed <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> to be real after an early metallurgical study concluded it was genuine. Then, in the late 1970s, scientists determined that <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> was a modern creation after it failed a battery of physical and chemical tests. Much of the mystery surrounding <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> continued until 2003, when historians finally advanced a theory about who created <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and why, showing <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> to be a practical joke by local historians gone very awry. <b>The</b> <b>plate</b> was acquired by - and until 2005 was on display at - the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley.|$|R
5|$|The {{function}} of Stegosaurus plates {{has been much}} debated. Initially thought of as some form of armor, {{they appear to have}} been too fragile and ill-placed for defensive purposes, leaving the animal's sides unprotected. The plates' large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal, either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species, in some form of sexual display, although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates. More recently, researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal, in a similar way to the sails of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus (and modern elephant and rabbit ears). <b>The</b> <b>plates</b> had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> would have cooled the blood.|$|E
5|$|The next {{species of}} Stegosaurus {{to be named}} was S. marshi, by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas {{reclassified}} this species in the new genus Hoplitosaurus later that year. Lucas also re-examined {{the issue of the}} life appearance of Stegosaurus, coming to the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned Charles R. Knight to produce a life restoration of S. ungulatus based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> were probably attached in staggered rows. In 1910, Richard Swann Lull wrote that the alternating pattern seen in S. stenops was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever Stegosaurus skeletal mount at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which was depicted with paired plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of S. stenops, including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> in alternating rows near the peak of the back, {{and that there was no}} evidence of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> having shifted relative to the body during fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plates</b> lie flat {{along the}} back, as a shingle-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, {{which led to}} the name 'roof lizard'. As further and {{complete}} plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} problem with <b>the</b> pusher <b>plate</b> {{is that of}} spalling—shards of metal—potentially flying {{off the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> <b>The</b> shockwave from the impacting plasma on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> passes through <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and reaches <b>the</b> top surface. At that point spalling may occur damaging <b>the</b> pusher <b>plate.</b> For that reason alternative substances, plywood and fiberglass, were investigated for the surface layer of <b>the</b> pusher <b>plate</b> and thought to be acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Light {{sensitive}} polymer plates {{allow for}} photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating {{is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> by either <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> supplier or <b>the</b> artist. Light is projected onto <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using drypoint, further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.|$|R
25|$|In chicken embryos, while <b>the</b> neural <b>plate</b> {{increases}} {{in length and}} decreases in apical width, the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> does not change drastically. As <b>the</b> neural <b>plate</b> progresses through <b>the</b> Hamburger-Hamilton stages, <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> thickens until about HH6-7, when <b>the</b> neural <b>plate</b> begins to fold into tube form. The apical surface area increases during neurulation, unlike amphibian embryos. In mouse embryos, {{there is a large}} convex-shaped curve to each side of the middle of <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> This curve has to be reversed as <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> rolls together to form the neural tube.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plates</b> were paired in {{a double}} row along the back. This is {{probably}} the most common arrangement in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The Stegosaurus in the 1933 film, King Kong, has this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Two rows of {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some S. stenops fossils in which <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> are still partially articulated show this arrangement. This arrangement is chiral and so demands that a specimen {{be distinguished from}} its distinct, hypothetical mirror-image form.|$|E
5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E
30|$|Another minor {{complication}} {{we encountered}} was the prominent position of <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> is precontoured, there is seldom reason to bend <b>the</b> <b>plate,</b> but when <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> {{does need to}} be bent to adjust it to the individual shape of the clavicle, we think a prominent and palpable plate would be much less of a problem.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Cocos <b>Plate</b> {{is a young}} oceanic tectonic <b>plate</b> beneath <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean off {{the west}} coast of Central America, named for Cocos Island, which rides upon it. <b>The</b> Cocos <b>Plate</b> was created {{approximately}} 23 million years ago when <b>the</b> Farallon <b>Plate</b> broke into two pieces, which also created <b>the</b> Nazca <b>Plate.</b> <b>The</b> Cocos <b>plate</b> also broke into two pieces, creating <b>the</b> Rivera <b>plate.</b> <b>The</b> Cocos <b>plate</b> is bounded by several different <b>plates.</b> To <b>the</b> Northeast it is bounded by <b>the</b> North American <b>plate</b> and <b>the</b> Caribbean <b>plate.</b> To <b>the</b> west it is bounded by <b>the</b> Pacific <b>plate,</b> and finally to the south it is bounded by <b>the</b> Nazca <b>plate.</b>|$|R
