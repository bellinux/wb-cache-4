6000|$|... "Then you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> love lost {{between the}} master and man or {{mistress}} and maid nowadays," [...] our beaten antagonist feebly sneered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mistake," [...] said Lord Ragnall, {{staring at}} us. [...] "This is Sir Junius Fortescue, {{who used to}} be Mr. Fortescue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about it. From none of them, I should <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> story about a Sir Guy who was a king's friend. I never trouble myself about it. I hate aristocracy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. He <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mystery {{about his}} parentage--that's all. Jude {{is going to}} tell him when he is a little older." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} about it, Gilbert?" [...] demanded Jane. [...] "Don't you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{children}} who really need a whipping now and then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She doesn't {{mean what}} she says," [...] said Mara; [...] "but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{objections}} {{in a young}} lady's name being given to a ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mistake," [...] said Augusta, hurriedly {{and with}} a slight blush. [...] "I am a second-class {{passenger}} on board this ship, and therefore cannot have the pleasure of sitting next to Lady Holmhurst." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} the truth of it, I do <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> sort of a quarrel between them. Of course, I am not sure it is on Miss Ford's account. But they don't act as they used to." ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{of their}} peculiarities is {{their fear of}} traps and snares. Very often they will not spring upon an ox or a horse, simply because it is tied to a tree. They <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> trick {{when they see the}} animal is {{fastened}} by a rope.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir, in {{the name}} of my scholars! And proud <b>am</b> I to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>SOME</b> of them, at least, that are really ANXIOUS to learn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, dear, that I {{shall have}} to ask you to help me to do <b>some</b> shopping. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> stores near here. We had better drive to them." ...|$|R
60|$|I slept like a top, so soundly {{indeed that}} I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> kind of {{soporific}} in the pick-me-up {{which looked like}} sherry, especially as the others who had drunk of it also passed an excellent night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} {{a woman who}} was {{constantly}} bullied by her husband who did not like him the better for it," [...] Miss Clapperclaw says. And though this speech has some of Clapp's usual sardonic humor in it, I can't but <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> truth in the remark.|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} the Western matter, I believe the program will have to stand {{substantially}} as I first put it. Henderson, and especially Brown, believe that the social influence of St. Louis would inevitably tell injuriously upon General Pope in the particular difficulty existing there, and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> force in that view.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} {{now in the}} year but autumn and winter. I really begin to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> terrible change of climate coming upon the world for its sin, like another deluge. It will have its rainbow, I suppose, after its manner--promising not to darken the world again, and then not to drown.|$|E
60|$|She drew up the kaross over me, again {{patted my}} hand in her motherly fashion and departed, still smiling, after which I went to sleep again, so dreamlessly that I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> native {{soporific}} in that soup.|$|R
6000|$|... "While I {{was rushing}} Rojas {{a couple of}} cowboys shot out the lamplights. A Mexican who pulled a knife on me got hurt, I guess. Then I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> {{shooting}} from the rebels after the room was dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> {{beginning}} to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> risk of your forgetting him, which, perhaps, wouldn't be altogether unnatural. He's {{a long way}} off, which has often its effect, and there's no denying {{the fact that in}} many respects you and he are different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And imposition,' added Gowan, laughing; 'we won't {{leave out}} the imposition. I hope I may not break down in that; but there, my being a {{disappointed}} man may show itself. I {{may not be able}} to face it out gravely enough. Between you and me, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> danger of my being just enough soured not to be able to do that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it so?" [...] said Clara; [...] "and was it indeed {{yourself}} whom I saw even now?--I thought so, {{and something}} I {{said at the}} time--but my brain has been but ill settled since we last met--But I am well now--quite well--I have invited all the people yonder to come to Shaws-Castle--my brother desired me to do it--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Tyrrel there--though I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> old grudge between my brother and you." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hastings, {{with this}} great body of bribery against him, was providentially freed from Nundcomar, {{one of his}} accusers, and, as good events do not come alone, (I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> such proverb,) it did so happen that all the rest, or {{a great many of}} them, ran away. But, however, the {{recorded}} evidence of the former charges continued; no new evidence came in; and Mr. Hastings enjoyed that happy repose which branded peculation, fixed and eternized upon the records of the Company, must leave upon a mind conscious of its own integrity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh-h-h!" [...] said Peter Rabbit, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> beetles {{under that}} great flat stone where that little black string is {{sticking}} out. Now when I count three you grab that string and pull hard perhaps you'll find a beetle {{at the other}} end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{believe the}} vessel {{lies in the}} inlet still. They have used her now and then. It is {{understood}} that they were warranted in seizing her, but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> diplomatic pressure {{brought to bear on}} them, for they sent her crew home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. I have no trustee, {{but the one}} you saw on the {{day when}} you fraudulently married me. And his trust {{is not a very}} {{difficult}} one, for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> odd shillings or pence, if you are very particular.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From what I heard, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> {{trouble on}} shore, and that's {{the reason why}} your father has not come for {{you as soon as}} he expected. But he thinks you safe with Ben Greenway. Now {{what we have to do}} is to get away from this vessel; and then if she sails and leaves your father and Ben Greenway, it will be a good thing. These fellows are rascals, and no honest person should have to do with them. But now I must get out of sight, or {{somebody}} will come and spoil everything." ...|$|E
60|$|In English ale their dear {{enjoyment}} lies, For {{which they}} starve themselves and families. An Englishman will fairly drink as much, As will maintain two families of Dutch: Subjecting all their labours to the pots; The greatest artists {{are the greatest}} sots. The country poor do by example live; The gentry lead them, and the clergy drive; What may we not from such examples hope? The landlord is their god, the priest their pope; A drunken clergy, and a swearing bench, Has given the reformation such a drench, As wise men <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> cause to doubt, Will purge good manners and religion out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would think}} that Jim Welton had changed his nature," [...] replied Jones, whose anger {{disappeared}} {{as quickly as it}} came. [...] "I have no objection to your storming at me, Jim. You may swear at me as much as you please, but, for any sake, spare me your reasonings and entreaties, because they only rouse the evil spirit within me, without doing an atom of good; and don't talk of leaving me. Besides, let me tell you, you are not so disinterested in this matter as you <b>think.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> one in Yarmouth who {{has something to do with}} your interest in me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} {{a part of}} Mrs. Heep's humility, that she still wore weeds. Notwithstanding the lapse of time that had {{occurred}} since Mr. Heep's decease, she still wore weeds. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> compromise in the cap; but otherwise she was as weedy as {{in the early days}} of her mourning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{all hope}} for Jane is gone forever! I have passed a happy day, though a busy one, for I did begin to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> chance for me. A man cannot see Nelson without pulling up, and wishing to be {{something}} like him; but a prison {{is no place for}} promotion." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis, McCain said its root cause was loose credit and greed. On January 31, 2008, he said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> greedy people on Wall Street that perhaps {{need to be}} punished." [...] He also praised the George W. Bush administration's handling of the crisis. McCain later addressed the situation in a speech: ...|$|R
6000|$|Britt persisted. [...] "I {{was merely}} {{going to say}} that I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> basis for all this humbuggery. These mediums don't start from nothing. They nearly all begin with some abnormality. Some {{submerged}} power rises to the surface of their minds like a sea-serpent, and that distinguishes them as seers. Curious friends crowd around, then the lying begins. It's going to be worth while to take the subject up, by-and-by. I'd do it myself if I could live in New York City." [...] He rose. [...] "Well, I don't blame you for not going into this case--I wish I were clear of it myself--but I was hoping you'd had some experience that would help me." [...] Thereupon the conversation shifted to other grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Objection {{has also}} been taken that the same {{government}} which is now being given to the Transvaal has not {{been given to the}} Orange River Colony. I think that the experiment might have been far better tried in the Orange River Colony. It is quite true that in that Colony there is an enormous majority of the Dutch or Boer population. But they have shown by long experience that they are most capable and moderate administrators--under the admirable rule of President Brand they set an example to the whole of South Africa; and although I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> danger in this experiment, it is in the Orange River Colony that I myself would have been inclined, in the first instance, to take the risk." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such persons as Mary do not analyze distinctly, {{in their}} thoughts, nor could they express in words, the {{principles}} which underlie their management; {{but they have}} an instinctive mental perception of the adaptation of such means to the end in view. Other people, who observe how easily and quietly they seem to obtain an ascendency over all children coming within their influence, and how absolute this ascendency often becomes, are frequently surprised at it. They <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> mystery about it; {{they say it is}} [...] "a knack that some people have;" [...] but there is no mystery about it at all, and nothing unusual or strange, except so far as practical good sense, considerate judgment, and intelligent observation and appreciation of the characteristics of childhood are unusual and strange.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{he is out}} of {{the house}} Miss Peters is giving her name at the front door. Put {{yourself}} in Jones' place. What does he think? He <b>is</b> suspicious. He <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>some</b> game on. He skips upstairs again, waits until Miss Peters has gone into your room, then stands outside and listens. How about that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, but I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> self-blame in him, {{though not}} about that horse. I believe {{he thought he}} might have checked Arthur more. And he had debts which he seems to have paid on selling out his capital. So, as I have told poor Bertha {{whenever}} she would let me, <b>there</b> may have <b>been</b> other reasons besides her stinging words.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I <b>think</b> she <b>thinks.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{sorts of}} {{helplessness}} that are contemptible. However, a small difference has taken place. That's why he won't wait any longer. His mother has come out, she has something--a little--and she's able to assist him. She'll {{live with them}} and bear some of the expenses, and after her death the son will have what there is." ...|$|R
