5|$|The proto-Arabian horse {{may have}} been domesticated {{by the people of}} the Arabian {{peninsula}} known today as the Bedouin, some time after <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> use the camel, approximately 4,000–5,000years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E

They also discovered, thanks to the display panel information, that they recovered energy proportional to their expertise with the single pedal.|$|E
25|$|Since Leptictidium young {{were very}} {{vulnerable}} to attacks of predators, {{it is probable}} that they were born quite developed and that they became independent when they were still quite young. From the behavior of today's elephant shrew, the possibility can be suggested that Leptictidium young went out to hunt with their mother, and that <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> distinguish prey by licking their mother's mouth when she had just caught an animal, in order to know the flavor of food.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} and autumn of 1942, the Nazi police {{deported}} several Jewish families of Markowa to their deaths {{as part of the}} German Final solution to the Jewish question. Only those who were hidden in Polish peasants' homes survived. Eight Jews found shelter with the Ulmas: six members of the Szall (Szali) family from Łańcut including father, mother and four sons, as well as the two daughters of Chaim Goldman, Golda and Layka. Józef Ulma put all eight Jews in the attic. <b>They</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> help him with supplementary jobs while in hiding, to ease the incurred expenses.|$|E

25|$|In 1932, {{during the}} Great Depression, {{the state of}} Virginia helped the Pamunkey develop their pottery {{as a source of}} income. The state set up a program for a pottery school and {{provided}} a teacher. The state furnished materials for the building, but the tribe built it themselves. Tribal members learned methods to increase the speed of manufacture. They incorporated firing pottery in a kiln and using glazes into their techniques. <b>They</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> use squeeze molds to produce copies of pots quickly. Kiln firing produced finished pottery of more uniform brown tones than the shades of gray from traditional pottery techniques.|$|E

25|$|Pathogens can {{suppress}} amygdala activity. Rats {{infected with}} the toxoplasmosis parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within {{the body of the}} cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats. In a separate experiment, rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli. These rats pulled on levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks. While <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> avoid pressing on them, they did not distance themselves from these shock-inducing levers.|$|E

25|$|In Trauma and Recovery, Herman {{expresses the}} {{additional}} concern that patients {{who suffer from}} C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude to the historical misdiagnosis of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so {{as a result of the}} intensity of the trauma bond – in which someone becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them (also known as Stockholm Syndrome – seen in cases of kidnapping in which a person falls in love with their captors) and the responses <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma – a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 {{systematic}} review of CI {{for people with}} unilateral hearing loss found that of the studies conducted and published, none were randomized, only one evaluated a control group, and no study was blinded; after eliminating multiple uses of the same subjects, the authors found that 137 people with UHL had received a CI. While acknowledging {{the weakness of the}} data, the authors found that CI in people with UHL improves sound localization compared with other treatments in people who lost hearing after <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> speak; in the one study that examined this, CI did improve sound localization in people with UHL who lost hearing before learning to speak. It appeared to improve speech perception and to reduce tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} at the moment when the earth opened up, Korah's sons were {{suspended}} in the air. When the sons of Korah saw the gaping abyss below {{on one side and the}} fire of Gehinnom on the other, they were unable to open their mouths to confess. But as soon as thoughts of repentance stirred in their hearts, God accepted them. Whatever thoughts one of the sons developed, the others developed as well, so that all three were of one heart. The area around them split apart, but the spot on which each stood was not touched. They stood separately like three pillars. Moses, Aaron, and all the great scholars came to hear the song of the sons of Korah, and from this <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> sing songs before God.|$|E

25|$|ChuChu Rocket! was {{developed}} by Sonic Team, and led by director and producer Yuji Naka. According to Naka, he had {{the idea for the}} game because he wanted to use the power of the Dreamcast to create 100 sprites moving at once. He noted there are two trends to utilize evolving hardware: one is to make increasingly beautiful graphics while the other is to squeeze as much processing power to use it to its fullest; he chose the latter in this case. Naka and his team found difficulty working on the networking component, but believed it was a good learning experience. Part of ChuChu Rocket!s purpose was to test the capabilities of online multiplayer gaming on the Dreamcast; the team used what <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> help drive the development of Phantasy Star Online (2000). A NAOMI arcade version of the game was also planned, but later scrapped.|$|E
