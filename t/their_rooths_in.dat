He was so occupied in watching her face--for he now saw pretty clearly what he should attempt to make of it--that he was conscious only in a secondary degree of the story she illustrated, and had in regard to her acting a surprised sense that she was extraordinarily quiet. He remembered her loudness, her violence in Paris, at Peter Sherringham's, her wild wails, the first time, at Madame Carré's; compared with which her present manner was eminently temperate and modern. Nick Dormer was not critical at the theatre; he believed what he saw and had a pleasant sense of the inevitable; therefore he wouldn't have guessed what Gabriel Nash had to tell him--that for this young woman, with her tragic cast and her peculiar attributes, her present performance, full of actuality, of light fine indications and at moments of pointed touches of comedy, was a rare tour de force. It went on altogether in a register he hadn't supposed her to possess and in which, as he said, she didn't touch her capital, doing it all with her wonderful little savings. It conveyed to him that she was capable of almost anything.|$|R
40|$|Ann Eliza Hepburne {{was born}} in Chippawa, Ontario, in 1821, to William Hepburne and Susan Shannon. In 1842, she married William Anthony <b>Rooth</b> <b>in</b> St. James Cathedral in Toronto. They {{continued}} to live {{in different parts of}} the Niagara region, including Drummondville, Welland and Port Colborne. William was the editor and proprietor of the Drummondville Reporter, as well as an accountant and insurance agent, and later worked for the Customs Service in Port Colborne. He died in 1878, and Eliza in 1899. Both are buried in Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Fonds consists of a friendship album and a scrapbook. The friendship album contains poems, letters, illustrations, soldiers autographs and some clippings, dated from 1837 - 1897. Some names of those who contributed to the album include Eliza’s husband William Anthony Rooth, Thomas Cummings, George Conventry, M. M. Johnson, Robert Nelles, Oliver T. Macklem, Thomas Macklem, and L. D. Raymond. There are also autographs of soldiers from the Trinity College Rifles, Toronto, dated 1866. The Trinity College Rifles fought in the Battle of Ridgeway during the Fenian Raid of June, 1866, and were possibly billeted with the <b>Rooth</b> family <b>in</b> Port Colborne. Soldiers from the 13 th Battalion, Hamilton, also signed the book, with the entry dated June 18, 1866. There are also signatures of A. K. Scholfield and H. Scholfield, W. C. F. [Welland Canal Field] Battery. The scrapbook is dated 1872 and contains clippings from publications such as Harper’s weekly, the London Illustrated news, and Frank Leslie’s Illustrated newspaper. Most of the clippings are illustrations, with some poems and articles, as well as editorial cartoons. Most of the material concerns world politics and events. However, the last two pages of the scrapbook contain obituaries of local citizens, including Thomas Clark Street, William Macklem, Edward Lee, Richard Hiscotte, and J. C. Woodruff. Other local items of interest include illustrations and descriptions of Niagara Falls (including a poem by George Coventry); a sketch of Queenston in 1812 and one of Brock’s monument, 1860; an article about Sir Allan Napier McNab; an obituary of Col. Thomas Adams, paymaster on the Welland Canal; an article on a fundraiser for St. James Church, Port Colborne; a programme of the reception of the Prince of Wales through Drummondville and Queenston Heights, 1860; and a description of a vessel going over Niagara Falls, 1827. It is unclear whether the scrapbook was kept by Ann Eliza Hepburne Rooth, or one of her daughters. Loose items enclosed in the scrapbook include several posters, assorted clippings, and a copy of the Port Colborne Messenger, dated July 4, 1866.

6000|$|How, further, {{shall we}} exactly measure for him--Sherringham felt the {{discomfort}} of the advantage Miriam had of him--the {{advantage of her}} presenting herself in a light that rendered any passion he might entertain an implication of duty {{as well as of}} pleasure? Why there should have been this implication was more than he could say; sometimes he held himself rather abject, or at least absurdly superstitious, for seeing it. He didn't know, he could scarcely conceive, of another case of the same general type in which he would have recognised it. In foreign countries there were very few ladies of Miss Rooth's intended profession who would not have regarded it as too strong an order that, to console them for not being admitted into drawing-rooms, they should have no offset but the exercise of a virtue in which no one would believe. This was because in foreign countries actresses were not admitted into drawing-rooms: that was a pure English drollery, ministering equally little to real histrionics and to the higher tone of these resorts. Did the oppressive sanctity which made it a burden to have to reckon with his young friend come then from her being English? Peter could recall cases in which that privilege operated as little as possible as a restriction. It came a great deal from Mrs. <b>Rooth,</b> <b>in</b> whom he apprehended depths of calculation as to what she might achieve for her daughter by [...] "working" [...] the idea of a life blameless amid dire obsessions. Her romantic turn of mind wouldn't in the least prevent her regarding that idea as a substantial capital, to be laid out to the best worldly advantage. Miriam's essential irreverence was capable, on a pretext, of making mince-meat of it--that he was sure of; for the only capital she recognised was the talent which some day managers and agents would outbid each other in paying for. Yet as a creature easy at so many points she was fond of her mother, would do anything to oblige--that might work in all sorts of ways--and would probably like the loose slippers of blamelessness quite as well as having to meet some of the queer high standards of the opposite camp.|$|R

6000|$|He {{made her}} stick to her English and read Shakespeare aloud to him. Mrs. Rooth had {{recognised}} {{the importance of}} apartments in which {{they should be able}} to receive so beneficent a visitor, and was now mistress of a small salon with a balcony and a rickety flower-stand--to say nothing of a view of many roofs and chimneys--a very uneven waxed floor, an empire clock, an armoire à glace, highly convenient for Miriam's posturings, and several cupboard doors covered over, allowing for treacherous gaps, with the faded magenta paper of the wall. The thing had been easily done, for Sherringham had said: [...] "Oh we must have a sitting-room for our studies, you know, and I'll settle it with the landlady," [...] Mrs. Rooth had liked his [...] "we"--indeed she liked everything about him--and he saw in this way that she heaved with no violence under pecuniary obligations so long as they were distinctly understood to be temporary. That he should have his money back with interest as soon as Miriam was launched was a comfort so deeply implied that it only added to intimacy. The window stood open on the little balcony, and when the sun had left it Peter and Miriam could linger there, leaning on the rail and talking above the great hum of Paris, with nothing but the neighbouring tiles and tall tubes to take account of. Mrs. <b>Rooth,</b> <b>in</b> limp garments much ungirdled, was on the sofa with a novel, making good her frequent assertion that she could put up with any life that would yield her these two conveniences. There were romantic works Peter had never read and as to which he had vaguely wondered to what class they were addressed--the earlier productions of M. Eugène Sue, the once-fashionable compositions of Madame Sophie Gay--with which Mrs. Rooth was familiar and which she was ready to enjoy once more if she could get nothing fresher. She had always a greasy volume tucked under her while her nose was bent upon the pages in hand. She scarcely looked up even when Miriam lifted her voice to show their benefactor what she could do. These tragic or pathetic notes all went out of the window and mingled with the undecipherable concert of Paris, so that no neighbour was disturbed by them. The girl shrieked and wailed when the occasion required it, and Mrs. Rooth only turned her page, showing in this way a great esthetic as well as a great personal trust.|$|R

At the end of their first sitting her having done so appeared the most natural thing in the world: he had a perfect right to entertain her there--explanations and complications were engulfed in the productive mood. The business of [...] "knocking her in" [...] held up a lamp to her beauty, showed him how much there was of it and that she was infinitely interesting. He didn't want {{to fall in love with}} her--that would be a sell, he said to himself--and she promptly became much too interesting for it. Nick might have reflected, for simplification's sake, as his cousin Peter had done, but with more validity, that he was engaged with Miss <b>Rooth</b> <b>in</b> an undertaking which didn't in the least refer to themselves, that they were working together seriously and that decent work quite gainsaid sensibility--the humbugging sorts alone had to help themselves out with it. But after her first sitting--she came, poor girl, but twice--the need of such exorcisms passed from his spirit: he had so thoroughly, so practically taken her up. As to whether his visitor had the same bright and still sense of co-operation to a definite end, the sense of the distinctively technical nature of the answer to every question to which the occasion might give birth, that mystery would be lighted only were it open to us to regard this young lady through some other medium than the mind of her friends. We have chosen, as it happens, for some of the great advantages it carries with it, the indirect vision; and it fails as yet to tell us--what Nick of course wondered about before he ceased to care, as indeed he intimated to her--why a budding celebrity should have dreamed of there being something for her in so blighted a spot. She should have gone to one of the regular people, the great people: they would have welcomed her with open arms. When Nick asked her if some of the R.A.'s hadn't expressed a wish for a crack at her she replied: [...] "Oh dear no, only the tiresome photographers; and fancy them in the future.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that an unlexicalized PCFG can parse much more accurately than previously shown, by {{making use of}} simple, linguistically motivated state splits, which break down false independence assumptions latent in a vanilla treebank grammar. Indeed, its performance of 86. 36 % (LP/LR F 1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-theart. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize. In the early 1990 s, as probabilistic methods swept NLP, parsing work revived the investigation of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) (Booth and Thomson, 1973; Baker, 1979). However, early results on the utility of PCFGs for parse disambiguation and language modeling were somewhat disappointing. A conviction arose that lexicalized PCFGs (where head words annotate phrasal nodes) were the key tool for high performance PCFG parsing. This approach was congruent with the great success of word n-gram models in speech recognition, and drew strength from a broader interest in lexicalized grammars, as well as demonstrations that lexical dependencies were a key tool for resolving ambiguities such as PP attachments (Ford et al., 1982; Hindle and <b>Rooth,</b> 1993). <b>In</b> the following decade, great success in terms of parse disambiguation and even language modeling was achieved by various lexicalized PCF...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of four self-contained papers and focuses on discrimination in themarket place. Essay 1 : “Disability Discrimination in the Rental Housing Market – A Field Experiment onBlind Tenants. ” Although discrimination against disabled people has been investigated inthe labor market, the housing market has received less attention in this regard. This paperfocuses on the latter market and investigates whether blind tenants assisted by guide dogsare discriminated against in the rental housing market. The data are collected through afield experiment in which written applications were sent in response to onlineadvertisements posted by different types of advertisers. I find statistically significantevidence that one type of online advertiser, that is, the apartment owner (i. e., a person whoadvertises and rents out his/her own apartment(s) on his/her own), discriminates againstblind tenants, {{because of the presence}} of the guide dog, not because of the disability. According to the legislation, this behavior qualifies as illegal discrimination. Essay 2 : “Does the design of correspondence studies influence the measurement of discrimination?”(co-authored with Carlsson and Rooth). Correspondence studies can identify the extent ofdiscrimination in hiring as typically defined by the law, which includes discriminationagainst ethnic minorities and females. However, as Heckman and Siegelman (1993) show,if employers act upon a group difference in the variance of unobserved variables, thismeasure of discrimination may not be very informative. This issue has essentially beenignored in the empirical literature until the recent methodological development byNeumark (2012). We apply Neumark’s method to a number of already publishedcorrespondence studies. We find the Heckman and Siegelman critique relevant forempirical work and give suggestions on how future correspondence studies may address thiscritique. Essay 3 : “Does Labor Market Tightness Affect Ethnic Discrimination in Hiring?” (co-authoredwith Carlsson and <b>Rooth).</b> <b>In</b> this study, we investigate whether ethnic discriminationdepends on labor market tightness. While ranking models predict a negative relationship,the prediction of screening models is ambiguous about the direction of the relationship. Thus, the direction of the relationship is purely an empirical issue. We utilize three (butcombine into two) correspondence studies of the Swedish labor market and two distinctlydifferent measures of labor market tightness. These different measures produce very similarresults, showing that a one percent increase in labor market tightness increases ethnicdiscrimination in hiring by 0. 5 - 0. 7 percent, which is consistent with a screening model. This result stands in sharp contrast to the only previous study on this matter, Baert et al. (forthcoming), which finds evidence that supports a ranking model. Essay 4 : “Relative Age Effect on Labor Market Outcomes for High Skilled Workers – Evidencefrom Soccer. ” In sports and education contexts, children are divided into age groups that arearbitrary constructions based on admission dates. This age-group system is thought todetermine differences in maturity between pupils within the same group, that is, relative 904627 Luca Furmaco_inl. indd 5 2015 - 02 - 24 16 : 58 age (RA). In turn, these within-age-group maturity differences produce performance gaps,that is, relative age effects (RAEs), which might persist and affect labor market outcomes. Ianalyze the RAE on labor market outcomes using a unique dataset of a particular group ofhigh-skilled workers: soccer players in the Italian major soccer league. In line with previousstudies, evidence on the existence of an RAE in terms of representativeness is found,meaning that players born relatively early in an age group are over-represented, whileplayers born relatively late are under-represented, even accounting for specific populationtrends. Moreover, players born relatively late in an age group receive lower gross wages thanplayers born relatively early. This wage gap seems to increase with age and in the quantileof the wage distribution...|$|R
40|$|Association with focus has, since Jackendoff's (1972) dissertation, {{been the}} object of intense study. Most researchers, however, have {{concentrated}} on explaining the semantic variability of only and even, whose truth conditions vary with the position of focus. I take as my starting point another property of associating expressions. Both only and even restrict the distribution of focus, a property that, I argue, they share {{with a range of}} other lexical items. But, while only and even take a single argument and require there to be a focus somewhere inside that argument, expressions like adversative but and let alone take two arguments, thereby associating with two foci. Associating expressions, of both the one- and two-place varieties, have two things in common. First, they are crosscategorial in their syntax, taking arguments of a variety of different types. Second, they evoke multiple alternatives—different possible answer to a question. Together, these two independent properties of associating expressions interact with the question under discussion (Roberts 1996, 2004) to give rise to the restriction on the distribution of focus. My approach to association with focus departs from previous ones in important ways. Associating expressions neither make reference to focus <b>in</b> <b>their</b> lexical entry (<b>Rooth</b> 1985, 1992, 1996) nor to the question under discussion (Beaver and Clark 2008), providing a more satisfying {{answer to the question of}} why only some expressions associate with focus...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a dynamic account of topic and focus. A dynamic view on meanings as context change potentials (e. g. Stalnaker, Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) will {{provide us with}} a substantial account of the dependence of focused answers on the context set up by their preceding questions. Questions pose conditions on the focal structure of their answers (Paul 1880) and can further restrict the domain of subsequent focusing operators like only (e. g. von Stechow 1990; von Fintel 1995; Jäger 1996). As an illustration of these two facts consider the following example: (1) a. Who did John introduce to Sue? b. Which gentlemen did John introduce to Sue? c. John only introduced [Bill]F to Sue. d. # John only introduced Bill to [Sue]F. After question (1 a) or (1 b), only an answer with the focal structure in (1 c) is felicitous or congruent. The focal structure in (1 d) is out. Consider now the meaning of the congruent answer (1 c). After question (1 a), (1 c) means ‘The only person John introduced to Sue is Bill’. After (1 b), it can mean ‘The only gentleman John introduced to Sue is Bill’. Standard analyses of focus define congruence in terms of identity between the question meaning and the focal alternatives of the answer (e. g. von Stechow 1990; Roberts 1996), and identify the domain of focusing operators like only with the set of focal alternatives (e. g. <b>Rooth</b> 1985). <b>In</b> our example, the two distinct questions (1 a) and (1 b) pose the same conditions on the focal structures of their answers but can have different effects on the quantificational domain of subsequent only. These two facts constitute a problem for these standard theories unless they come equipped with a smart analysis of the dynamics of domain restriction which plays a role in these cases. The main goal {{of this article is to}} provide such an analysis. Most existing dynamic analyses of questions have been developed in the tradition of the partition theory of Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984. In the partition theory, the meaning of a question is identified with the set of meanings of all its exhaustive answers.

An illustration of two birds by Benjamin, Eliza's son, he was ten years old at the time. There is a poem written by L. D. Raymond with an attached newspaper clipping from Welland. The clipping is from L. D. Raymond's 79 th birthday and is also a poem, "To the Old Barrister". There is a page of soldier autographs from 1866, those who fought in the Battle of Ridgeway during the Fenian Raid. ([URL] friendship album contains poems, letters, illustrations, soldiers autographs and some clippings, dated from 1837 - 1897. Some names of those who contributed to the album include Eliza’s husband William Anthony Rooth, Thomas Cummings, George Conventry, M. M. Johnson, Robert Nelles, Oliver T. Macklem, Thomas Macklem, and L. D. Raymond. There are also autographs of soldiers from the Trinity College Rifles, Toronto, dated 1866.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} (see e. g., [1]) that parallelism between two conjuncts of elliptical coordinative structures leads to easier processing {{of the second}} conjunct. In addition, information structure, especially focus marking, crucially affects the interpretation and processing of ellipses [1, 2, 3]. <b>In</b> <b>Rooth’s</b> alternative semantic theory (see [4), focus activates a set of alternatives that is salient to the comprehenders at the current discourse state (e. g., [5]). We ran an eye-tracking study (n= 57) to investigate how and when the activated set of focus alternatives affects the on-line processing of German elliptical structures. Moreover, we checked whether alternative activation requires (i) a particular structural marking, or (ii) is achieved by focus alone, by comparing the comprehension of elliptical utterances following focus cleft sentences and canonical sentences with default focus, respectively. Our experiment had a 2 x 2 design with the factors focus (cleft/default) and unelided constituent (subject/object) as exemplified in (1). In the first conjunct of (1 a,b), the subject stands in narrow focus induced by clefting; in (1 c,d), no element was focused syntactically i. e., readers had to assign default focus. In the second conjunct, everything except the object (1 a,c), or subject (1 b,d) was elided. The target items were preceded by a context to ensure that readers got the focus-background reading of the clefts in (1 a,b); in (1 c,d), {{the subject of the}} first conjunct representing new information is likely to receive focus. The statistical analysis was carried out using linear mixed models with several standard eye-tracking measures as dependent variables. We predicted an interaction o...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rooth {{was very}} fond of a moral and had never lost her taste for edification. She delighted in a {{beautiful}} character and was gratified to find so many more than she had supposed represented in the contemporary French drama. She never failed to direct Miriam's attention {{to them and to}} remind her that there is nothing in life so grand as a sublime act, above all when sublimely explained. Peter made much of the difference between the mother and the daughter, thinking it singularly marked--the way one took everything for the sense, or behaved as if she did, caring only for the plot and the romance, the triumph or defeat of virtue and the moral comfort of it all, and the way the other was alive but to the manner and the art of it, the intensity of truth to appearances. Mrs. <b>Rooth</b> abounded <b>in</b> impressive evocations, and yet he saw no link between her facile genius and that of which Miriam gave symptoms. The poor lady never could have been accused of successful deceit, whereas the triumph of fraud was exactly what her clever child achieved. She made even the true seem fictive, while Miriam's effort was to make the fictive true. Sherringham thought it an odd unpromising stock (that of the Neville-Nugents) for a dramatic talent to have sprung from, till he reflected that the evolution was after all natural: the figurative impulse in the mother had become conscious, and therefore higher, through finding an aim, which was beauty, in the daughter. Likely enough the Hebraic Mr. Rooth, with his love of old pots and Christian altar-cloths, had supplied in the girl's composition the esthetic element, the sense of colour and form. In their visits to the theatre there was nothing Mrs. Rooth more insisted on than the unprofitableness of deceit, as shown by the most distinguished authors--the folly and degradation, the corrosive effect on the spirit, of tortuous ways. Their companion soon gave up the futile task of piecing together her incongruous references to her early life and her family in England. He renounced even the doctrine that there was a residuum of truth in her claim of great relationships, since, existent or not, he cared equally little for her ramifications. The principle of this indifference was at bottom a certain desire to disconnect and isolate Miriam; for it was disagreeable not to be independent in dealing with her, and he could be fully so only if she herself were.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{an unusual}} {{identity}} constraint on English verb phrase ellipsis which imposes the following requirement: when an elliptical relation holds between two verb phrases A and B such that A {{is contained in}} an argument b of B, then the corresponding argument a of A must be iden-tical to b. I argue that these facts provide evidence for a semantic theory of the interpretation of variables in which assignment functions are partial, and binding involves adding new variable/value pairs to an assignment, rather than reassigning new values to (possibly previously used) variables. Based on additional data, I argue that the identity conditions on ellipsis must be {{stated in terms of}} semantic parallelism between constituents (potentially) larger than the elided phrases, as advocated <b>in</b> <b>Rooth</b> 1992; Fox 1999 a; Merchant 2001, and that the syntactic representation of binding structures must crucially encode binding indices on binders, rather than as adjuncts on their scope as in Heim and Kratzer 1998. I conclude by demonstrating that the analysis proposed here has broader empirical coverage than current variable-free analyses, and so potentially constitutes an argument for adopting a semantic framework that makes use of variables. 1 Argument identity eects in ellipsis Wasow (1972) notes the impossibility of verb phrase ellipsis in sentences such This paper is a long-overdue reassessment and rethinking of Kennedy 1994 that I orig-inally put together for the nal installment of the Workshop on Ellipsis in English and Japanese at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan.

6000|$|Miriam had dined when {{he reached}} the villa, but she was lying down, unduly fatigued, before going to the theatre. Mrs. <b>Rooth</b> was, however, <b>in</b> the drawing-room with three gentlemen, in two of whom the fourth visitor was not startled to {{recognise}} Basil Dashwood and Gabriel Nash. Dashwood appeared to have become Miriam's brother-in-arms and a second child--a fonder one--to Mrs. Rooth; it had reached Peter on some late visit that the young actor had finally moved his lodgings into the quarter, making himself a near neighbour for all sorts of convenience. [...] "Hang his convenience!" [...] Peter thought, perceiving that Mrs. Lovick's [...] "Arty" [...] was now altogether one of the family. Oh the family!--it was a queer one to be connected with: that consciousness was acute in Sherringham's breast to-day as he entered Mrs. Rooth's little circle. The place was filled with cigarette-smoke and there was a messy coffee-service on the piano, whose keys Basil Dashwood lightly touched for his own diversion. Nash, addressing the room of course, was at one end of a little sofa with his nose in the air, and Nick Dormer was at the other end, seated much at his ease and with a certain privileged appearance of having been there often before, though Sherringham knew he had not. He looked uncritical and very young, as rosy as a school-boy on a half-holiday. It was past five o'clock in the day, but Mrs. Rooth was not dressed; there was, however, no want of finish in her elegant attitude--the same relaxed grandeur (she seemed to let you understand) for which she used to be distinguished at Castle Nugent when the house was full. She toyed incongruously, in her unbuttoned wrapper, with a large tinsel fan which resembled a theatrical property.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates experimentally {{the role}} of Question-Answer Congruence (QAC, von Stechow 1990, <b>Rooth</b> 1985, 1992) <b>in</b> child language acquisition and adult sentence processing. Specifically, I present two case studies: sentences with "only" and sentences with the Rise-Fall-Rise contour (RFR, Jackendoff 1972). Case study 1 investigates a long-standing puzzle concerning the acquisition of "only. " Since Crain et al. (1994), many studies report children display difficulties understanding sentences with pre-subject "only" while having no difficulty with pre-verbal "only. " The current study manipulates the levels of QAC to study the puzzle. The results show that QAC {{plays a significant role}} in the asymmetry between Subject-only vs. VP-only, and more generally, both children and adults are sensitive to QAC, with congruence facilitating processing, and incongruence interfering with processing. We conclude that the cost of the accommodation of a sub-question to obey QAC is different for Subject-only and VP-only. I propose that the way information is packaged makes it easier to accommodate a set of questions asking about the object of the sentence, which makes it easier to process VP-only. We also showed that the extent to which QAC influences comprehension is different for children and adults. For children, QAC has a stronger influence than the syntactic condition on only. For adults, the syntactic condition is not violated. We suggest that the status of the syntactic condition regarding only is a factor that distinguishes children from adults in processing only. Case study 2 investigates whether children can construe the inverse scope interpretation, which children are reported to disfavor (Musolino 1998), with the RFR prosody, which is standardly taken to require inverse scope. The results show that both children and adults are sensitive to RFR and able to compute the implicature associated with RFR to disambiguate the inverse scope interpretation. As in the "only" study, QAC levels varied in the RFR experiment. However, the results revealed no effect of question type. This leaves an important open question: why QAC seems more active in children in determining the associate of only than in the determination of quantifier scope when the prosody makes the scope clear. by Ayaka Sugawara.
