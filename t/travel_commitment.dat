40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the effect of {{occupational}} demands on partner/family relationships of Canadian elite-level coaches. Twenty full-time national team coaches were interviewed in order to determine the nature of the occupational demands at this level and to examine the perceived impact of these demands on personal relationships. Coaching full-time as a national team coach requires a huge time, energy and <b>travel</b> <b>commitment.</b> Coaches, on the whole, felt that this commitment was necessary in order to perform the job with excellence. Coaching was seen as a passion or an obsession. As a result, coaches did perceive that the demands of their occupation had an effect on their relationships. Effects were described as both positive and negative in nature. Themes such as priorities, family functioning, leaving and returning, role in the family, family involvement in the occupation, partner qualities and the partner relationship arose from the interviews. The underlying question of this study was whether coaches believe that a balance between excellence in their occupation and excellence in their personal lives can be achieved. This question was discussed and recommendations for achieving a balance, through both lifestyle and institutional modifications, were suggested by coaches...|$|E

40|$|Background We {{sought to}} {{understand}} the barriers and facilitators to participation in research {{from the perspectives of}} South Asian people with asthma. Methods Eight focus groups were conducted in the preferred language of participants. Sampling was purposeful to ensure inclusion of males and females from differing ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds. Results The forming of trusting relationships was described as pivotal to the successful recruitment of minority ethnic groups into research; personalized approaches were likely to be better received than more impersonal written approaches. Notable barriers to participation included: the stigma of being labelled with asthma; concerns surrounding participation in pharmaceutical trials; major time or <b>travel</b> <b>commitments</b> and a failure to show respect by not making information available in minority ethnic languages. Flexibility, in terms of timing, location and respecting of cultural and religious sensitivities around gender segregation, together with the offer of incentives, were highlighted as key factors to promote participation. Conclusions The barriers to recruitment are largely surmountable, but these will necessitate the use of resource intensive and more personalized approaches than are commonly employed for the White European origin population. Our proposed model to enhance recruitment is likely to have transferability beyond the field of asthm...|$|R

40|$|The {{demise of}} {{enrolled}} nurse training programmes and the disestablishment of enrolled nurse positions in many health care areas in New Zealand in the 1990 s, hastened {{the development of}} transition programmes that enabled these nurses to undertake shortened courses leading to registration. The polytechnic was approached by health care providers from rural settings to deliver a programme offering transition to degree/registration for enrolled nurses who {{were not able to}} meet the time and <b>travel</b> <b>commitments</b> of a course based at the main campus. In 1998, a special two year six month transition to degree/registration programme based at the satellite campus of the polytechnic was offered to enrolled nurses.

(Business Management) South Africa is {{currently}} tackling more basic challenges such as poverty alleviation, job creation and Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment issues, whereas developed countries are prioritising Work-Life Balance {{in an attempt}} to humanise the workplace. Globalisation, modern technology and lean business practices are challenging the old and familiar patterns of paid work while imposing new challenges on families, individuals and households. This contributes to long working hours, high stress levels, low energy, extended <b>travel</b> <b>commitments,</b> reduced healthy family meals and limited basic quality of personal and family lifestyle. Business benefits are observed in organisations that involve employees in identifying and implementing solutions that provide a workplace that inculcates a culture of work-life balance. The benefits for business include the ability to attract high calibre employees, staff retention, efficiency on the job (distractions), employee commitment, high morale and reduced absenteeism rate. The study investigates the perception and/or views of management and journalists on the work-life balance initiatives at BDFM (Pty) Ltd. The recommendation on how Wellness Strategy initiatives should be implemented to mitigate challenges faced by journalists in the media industry gives conclusion to the study. The attraction and retention of high calibre journalists at BDFM (Pty) Ltd will help reduce both the direct and indirect costs that the organisation incurs when there is an unplanned employee turnover. The direct costs pertain to the recruitment and training of new employees who will replace the previous incumbent and the costs of mistakes made during the settling in period.

50|$|Born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, Machent {{left school}} {{at the age of}} fourteen, and was an {{apprentice}} builder before he started his career with local side Chesterfield Ramblers. His form for the club alerted Chesterfield and Sheffield United, with Chesterfield offering him professional terms in 1938. However, Sheffield United later offered him a better offer and he signed for the Blades. In October 1939 he was loaned to Buxton, making his debut against Ashton National in a 4-3 win. His early career at the club was cut short due to World War II and he played as a guest player for Chesterfield during the war. He remained with United for nine years, making 22 appearances and scoring twice. In November 1947 he joined Football League Second Division side Chesterfield for £6,000 plus Dick Culshaw. Injury restricted him to just 17 games in his first season for the club, as he twice suffered a broken arm. In the fourth game of the 1948-49 season he suffered a knee injury which kept him out {{for the rest of the}} campaign. He was transfer-listed in 1949 and later dropped into non-league football re-joining Cheshire League side Buxton. Whilst at Buxton he was part of the side that reached the third round of the FA Cup in 1951-52, beating Aldershot in the process. In his second season for Buxton he scored an impressive 26 goals in 19 league games. In July 1951 he signed for ambitious Southern League club Hereford United. He struggled to compete for a place in the first team, only making two appearances and he mainly featured for the reserves.

40|$|Despite greater {{prevalence}} rates of child {{mental health and}} behavior problems, rural areas are often overlooked by researchers in favor of urban areas that provide larger, more diverse samples. However, rural children’s problems manifest differently across home and school than what is seen in urban and suburban contexts. Conjoint behavioral consultation (CBC; Sheridan 2 ̆ 6 Kratochwill, 2008) is an evidence-based family-school partnership intervention wherein families and schools collaborate with a consultant to address child concerns. In its traditional format, the time specialized nature of delivering CBC and time and <b>travel</b> <b>commitments</b> needed by participants limits the feasibility of CBC as an option for many rural communities. Distance technology offers potential as a new method of delivering CBC that bypasses many of the barriers facing rural communities. ^ A concurrent multiple baseline across participants design {{was used to assess}} the efficacy of CBC via distance delivery (CBC-D) at improving child compliance. The acceptability of CBC-D to parents and teachers and the change in the parent-teacher relationship as a result of CBC-D were evaluated descriptively. Participants were four parent-teacher pairs from rural communities sharing concerns about a child’s compliance. CBC was conducted through videoconferencing with a behavioral consultant participating in the meetings remotely. ^ Results revealed little evidence of effects from CBC-D on child compliance. Positive mean changes in parent and teacher reports of compliance occurred for each participant; however, clear and consistent effects were only evident for one child at school. The lack of evidence supporting CBC-D may indicate that it is not an effective intervention for child compliance with rural participants; however, sample and measurement limitations make it difficult to draw a conclusive interpretation of the efficacy of CBC-D. Social validity data suggested high levels of acceptability of CBC-D to parents and teachers. Similarly, parent-teacher relationship data suggested that CBC-D can positively impact the parent-teacher relationship. Treatment integrity data indicated CBC-D can be implemented with high rates of integrity. Additionally, parent and teacher self-report of individualized intervention integrity was also high; however, there was a significant amount of missing integrity data for two participants. Limitations, implications and future directions are discussed. ...|$|R

This case study examines Lula’s authority role as President by testing the theories Cinderella Complex and Max Weber’s theory of Pure Leadership. It also tries to explain what motivates Lula’s actions and what affect this has on Brazilian politics. The case study reveals that Lula is not driven by any ideology, but is motivated by own personal interests of eliminating hunger and poverty. To realise these wishes he creates alliances in order to get enough support for these policies. Even though his government is designed as a bureaucratic administration, Lula has not proven to use rational ideas to establish new reforms. Instead he is dependent on raising enough support and trust, through his charismatic image. This is visible in his election campaigns. This leadership style has implemented some valuable programmes like the Fome Zero and Bolsa Familia, but his endless <b>travels</b> and <b>commitments</b> abroad joint with his approach to the corruption scandal in 2005 has created a new image of Lula as a negligent person.

Of the 428 women invited to participate, 376 were eligible and just under a quarter participated. Reasons for nonparticipation included concerns about CAM and lack of interest in participation in research. Other factors negatively affecting recruitment included recruitment timing, competition for participants, limited support from staff, and inadequate trial promotion. Factors encouraging recruitment included being interested in research and seeking pain relief. Reasons for dropping out were time constraints, <b>travel</b> issues, work <b>commitments,</b> and pregnancy issues.

As exclusion criteria, it was established that normotensive individuals {{could not be}} carriers of chronic cardiac or kidney disease or have a personal history of stroke. Of this total, 22 (8.76 %) expressed interest in participating, and 14 (3.52 %) attended the attraction meeting and {{agreed to participate in}} the intervention. Of the total number of pre-test participants (N[*]=[*] 33), 16 (48 %) completed the intervention (8 hypertensive and 8 normotensive), with absences/dropouts justified by <b>travel</b> or professional <b>commitments</b> at the time of the intervention. Participants who were unable to complete the sessions were contacted again with the possibility of resuming sessions in the next group meetings, with two participants returning and completing the intervention in subsequent groups. The criterion adopted was that the participant with an interest in completing the intervention should restart it from the first session, and it was not necessary to participate again in the gathering. The ages of the participants ranged from 39 to 62  years for hypertensive patients and 27 to 50  years for normotensive individuals. In addition, there were two female participants in the hypertensive group, while among the normotensive women, there were six women. This heterogeneity of sex and age, although increasing the ecological validity of the results, compromised the pairing of the two groups for later comparison.|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{understanding}} of the functional aspects of gait and balance has wide ramifications. Individuals with balance disorders often restrict physical activity, <b>travel,</b> and social <b>commitments</b> to avoid falling, and loss of balance confidence, itself, {{is a source of}} disability. We studied the functional aspects of gait in patients with essential tremor (ET), placing their findings within the context of two other neurological disorders (Parkinson’s disease [PD] and dystonia) and comparing them with age-matched controls. Methods: We administered the six-item Activities of Balance Confidence (ABC- 6) Scale and collected data on number of falls and near-falls, and use of walking aids in 422 participants (126 ET, 77 PD, 46 dystonia, 173 controls). Results: Balance confidence was lowest in PD, intermediate in ET, and relatively preserved in dystonia compared with controls. This ordering reoccurred for each of the six ABC- 6 items. The number of near-falls and falls followed a similar ordering. Use of canes, walkers, and wheelchairs was elevated in ET and even greater in PD. Several measures of balance confidence (ABC- 6 items 1, 4, 5, and 6) were lower in torticollis cases than in those with blepharospasm, although the two groups did not differ with respect to falls or use of walking aids.
