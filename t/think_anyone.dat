25|$|Brawn GP {{gave the}} BGP 001 its first test at the Circuit de Catalunya on 9 March 2009, topping the {{timesheets}} {{early on in}} the first session, eventually finishing the session in fourth. On day two, Rubens Barrichello took over and completed 111 laps, finishing third in the standings. This was followed by Button topping the timesheets on the third day by over a second clear of Felipe Massa's Ferrari, completing 130 laps. In response, Massa hailed the BGP 001 as the most competitive pre-season car, stating that he does not <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> can top their times and that Ferrari is currently less competitive than Brawn GP. On {{the final day of the}} test, Barrichello replicated the feat of his team-mate; topping the time sheets by over eight-tenths of a second from Nico Rosberg's Williams, completing 110 laps.|$|E
25|$|The College was {{in great}} {{disrepair}} when Jan Standonck took over—some {{of the walls}} were falling down. It had {{become known as the}} Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime on the students. They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only a piece of bread each day to eat. They {{had to go to the}} door of a nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. Erasmus, one of the students, later said he did not <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.|$|E
25|$|On {{day four}} of the enquiry, {{evidence}} was given by Imperial Airways Inspector of Engines that no example of the petrol pipe used on the aircraft had been rejected due to internal obstruction leading to reduced flow of fuel. He stated that he was satisfied that the engine was serviceable {{at the time of}} departure. Captain Barnard, who flew G-EBBY to Paris shortly after the accident had occurred, disagreed with a suggestion put to him that there was a problem with the engine, saying that he did not <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> could give a cause for the crash, other than the aircraft having stalled. Further evidence was heard as to the loading of the aircraft. The maintenance regime at Imperial Airways and the reliability of the de Havilland DH.34 were called into question by Mr Beyfus, a legal representative of one of the victims. Two witnesses from the aircraft's insurers gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was to the company's satisfaction. The Imperial Airways manager at Amsterdam corroborated Hinchcliffe's earlier evidence. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E

500|$|Feller again led {{the majors}} in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's {{pitching}} ability, stating [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> {{is ever going}} to throw a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn't human." [...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm." ...|$|E
500|$|After his death, {{dozens of}} footballing legends {{paid tribute to}} him, and the {{epilogue}} to his autobiography contains several pages of quotations. Pelé said he was [...] "the man who taught us the way football should be played", and Brian Clough added that [...] "he was a true gentleman and we shall never see his like again". English goalkeeping legend Gordon Banks said that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> since had a name so synonymous with football in England", whilst World Cup winning German defender Berti Vogts commented that [...] "It is not just in England where his name is famous. All over the world he {{is regarded as a}} true football genius".|$|E
500|$|On October 16, 2001, Enron {{announced}} that restatements to its financial statements for years 1997 to 2000 {{were necessary to}} correct accounting violations. The restatements for the period reduced earnings by $613 million (or 23% of reported profits during the period), increased liabilities {{at the end of}} 2000 by $628 million (6% of reported liabilities and 5.5% of reported equity), and reduced equity at the end of 2000 by $1.2 billion (10% of reported equity). Additionally, in January Jeff Skilling had asserted that the broadband unit alone was worth $35 billion, a claim also mistrusted.

500|$|Mars {{claims that}} his work with other artists has {{influenced}} his musical style: [...] " [...] Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music." [...] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: [...] "In Hawaii {{some of the biggest}} radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first." ...|$|E

But in that Shaw was willing to steal money from people who really needed it who really couldn't afford to lose it and willing to take everything they had…yes, he's in Bernie territory, with both feet." [...] Ratner initially approached Robert Redford to play the role, being a fan of {{his work in the}} heist film The Hot Rock, but Redford turned him down.|$|E
500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E

50|$|Socrates, {{not at all}} {{certain that}} he has not {{misrepresented}} Protagoras in making each man the measure of his own wisdom, presses Theodorus {{on the question of whether}} any follower of Protagoras (himself included) would contend that nobody <b>thinks</b> <b>anyone</b> else is wrong (170c). Theodorus proves to be helpless against Socrates' arguments. He agrees that Protagoras concedes that those who disagree with him are correct (171a). In making Protagoras a complete epistemological relativist, where every person's individual perceptions are his reality and his truth, both Socrates and Theodorus paint Protagoras as maintaining an absurd position.|$|R
500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Former Sega of America senior {{producer}} Scot Bayless {{attributes the}} unsuccessful market {{to a lack}} of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, [...] "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company {{fell in love with the}} idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made." [...] Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating [...] "I loved the Sega CD. I always thought the platform was under-appreciated and that it was hurt by an over-concentration of trying to make Hollywood interactive film games versus using its storage and extended abilities to make just plain great video games." [...] Former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander commented on the Mega-CD, saying [...] "The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product it was. I am afraid I cannot recall the sales numbers, but it was not a success." ...|$|E

In the late 1970s the membership had declined from a high of about 500,000 to only about 200,000. Hooks was determined to add to the enrollment and to raise money for the organization’s severely depleted treasury, without changing the NAACP’s goals or mandates. [...] "Black Americans are not defeated," [...] he told Ebony soon after his formal induction in 1977. [...] "The civil rights movement is not dead.

500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] is an uptempo gospel {{song with}} {{elements}} of pop music. The song was also noted for exploring elements of Contemporary Christian {{as well as}} electronic dance music. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse felt that the song contained a [...] "zippy", reggae-dance beat. Its instrumentation includes percussion instruments, synths and horn stabs along with African beats. According to sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., [...] "Say Yes" [...] is written in the key of D major using common time. It contains a moderately fast tempo with a metronome of 120 beats per minute and the singers' vocal elements range from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. The song samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Chris Payne and Colin Stutz of Billboard magazine {{described it as a}} modern dance and contemporary electronic dance reworking of that song. Stutz also found elements of an [...] "upbeat swing" [...] of West African gospel. Regarding the composition of the song, Williams stated, [...] "It is a song that came from Africa {{more than a hundred years}} ago. I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> knows who wrote it or who started singing that chorus. When the song leaked last week, so many people from Africa and Nigeria were trying to let me know where it came from." ...|$|E
500|$|Although in high school, Streep {{appeared}} in numerous school plays, she was uninterested in serious theater until {{acting in the}} play Miss Julie at Vassar College in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus. Vassar drama professor Clinton J Atkinson noted, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> ever taught Meryl acting. She really taught herself". Streep demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines. She received her BA cum laude from the college in 1971, before applying for an MFA from the Yale School of Drama. At Yale, she supplemented her course fees by waitressing and typing, and {{appeared in}} over a dozen stage productions a year, {{to the point that}} she became overworked, developing ulcers. She contemplated quitting acting and switching to study law. Streep played a variety of roles on stage, from Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream to an 80-year-old woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights Christopher Durang and Albert Innaurato. One of her teachers was Robert Lewis, one of the co-founders of the Actors Studio. Streep disapproved of some of the acting exercises she was asked to do, remarking that the professors [...] "delved into personal lives in a way I find obnoxious". She received her MFA from Yale in 1975. Streep also enrolled as a visiting student at Dartmouth College in the fall of 1970, and received an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the college in 1981.|$|E
500|$|Although xx {{had been}} highly {{anticipated}} by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound {{would have been}} entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was [...] "baffled" [...] by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made [...] "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't <b>think</b> <b>anyone</b> other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I {{have to be a}} bit more private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E

According to a 2014 survey commissioned by Variety, PewDiePie {{along with a few}} other YouTube personalities have been reported to be more influential and popular than mainstream celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, among US teenagers aged 13 through 18. His rise to fame has been used as [...] "a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas, courage, and, of course, a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society." [...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest". The following year, Time included him on their Time 100 list, with South Park co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, [...] "I know it might seem weird, especially to those of us from an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to see it as the birth of a new art form.
