2500|$|As McMahon later stated, [...] "I {{realised}} what I {{wanted to}} do was work with a good synth player [...] – a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when I heard he was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanland." [...] They worked on their first composition, [...] "Pulse," [...] inspired by the sound of a heartbeat.|$|E
2500|$|... "At a given point, I thought I could {{dedicate}} it to Pope Clement, {{the one of}} El Palmar de Troya, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that he had canonized [...] Franco, Primo de Rivera, Carrero Blanco and {{all those}} guys and, while {{on the one hand}} I thought it was funnier, on the other hand I thought the joke could be interpreted in a strange way and I didn't do it, though I was about to do it. But the record was made with a sincerity and a true intention, no matter the results, and I thought it was like ruining it a bit because of the joke.. and that was too much!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gehry, [...] "I was a {{truck driver}} in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried {{chemical}} engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b> You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes." [...] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from USC in 1954.|$|E
60|$|Well, I {{had hardly}} taken it when I felt an odd sort of psychic feeling--a sort of drowsiness. <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> in a dim way, going to bed, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> nothing till <b>I</b> woke up next morning.|$|R
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth I can recall {{very little of the}} events of that evening. A kind of dizzy weariness overmastered me. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> sitting at a table next to Stella, and eating heartily, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> nothing more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, sir, that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> your face; but {{of course}} you have changed a good deal, since <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> you well, for you often came down our lines; and you could speak the {{language}} fluently, and were fond of talking to us.|$|R
60|$|I thought perplexed. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{her cousins}} at Leatherhead.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{and laughed}} and that laugh did me a world of good.|$|E
60|$|I {{had it on}} my lips to say, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> Mr. Wharton's injunction.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> Thorns firing doubts at me obliquely {{across the}} table. [...] "You can't run a country through its spoilt children," [...] he said. [...] "What you call aristocrats are really spoilt children. They've {{had too much}} of everything, except bracing experience." ...|$|R
6000|$|ISABEL. Please, {{there as}} {{something}} I {{heard you talking}} about, last time, with Miss Mary. I was at my lessons, but I heard something about nests; and I thought it was birds' nests; and I couldn't help listening; and <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> it was about [...] "nests of quartz in granite." [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> because <b>I</b> was so disappointed! ...|$|R
60|$|Sheer down, screaming, seventy feet he fell, smashing to {{the earth}} with an audible thud and crunch, his body {{rebounding}} slightly and settling down again. Still he lived, for he moved and squirmed, clawing {{with his hands and}} feet. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the Fire-Man running forward with a stone and hammering him on the head...and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> no more.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that I had {{a friend}} on board, and stepped to the companion.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> all the {{problems}} that had been troubling me, although in truth I {{had never thought of}} propounding them to Zikali.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> at once {{where it}} was that I had seen him--at the broker's in the city, before we sailed for America.|$|E
40|$|Here {{is shown}} Bernhard Riemann's {{reaction}} to Helmholtz's Lehre von den Tonempfindungen. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> how Joseph Joachim, and Johannes Brahms valued Helmholtz's "natural" tuning. In the end, Planck's experiments {{with a particular}} new harmonium, and an a cappella choir concerning "natural" or tempered tuning are told...|$|R
6000|$|... "On and on I galloped {{up a steep}} road. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> hearing lions roaring round me in the darkness. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> one of them {{springing}} upon {{my horse}} and the poor beast's scream. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> no more till I found myself--I {{believe it was a}} week or so later--lying on the verandah of a nice house, and being attended by some good-looking women of an Abyssinian cast of countenance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{all seemed}} too amazing. For a time I couldn't speak coherently. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{thinking}} that whatever happened, whatever price I had to pay, I must stand upon {{the stage of}} that theatre and win. My lips were quite dry. His great voice seemed to have faded into a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I missed it, and I couldn't {{think where}} I {{could have left}} it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that I had been sitting here. Thank you so much.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> and {{reminded}} Bickley {{of the crash}} which we had heard while Yva and Bastin were absent on some secret business in the chamber.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> that enigmatical {{conversation}} between Poirot and Evelyn Howard. Was this {{what they had}} meant? Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> so well {{walking down}} the {{platform}} {{and looking at the}} illuminated clock at the end which {{told me that it was}} half-past eleven. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> also my wondering whether I could get home before midnight. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the big motor, with its glaring head-lights and glitter of polished brass, waiting for me outside. It was my new thirty-horse- power Robur, which had only been delivered that day. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> also asking Perkins, my chauffeur, how she had gone, and his saying that he thought she was excellent.|$|R
5000|$|Once in Juárez, {{he would}} {{regularly}} cross into the United States, since {{according to his}} memories, [...] "it was so easy {{to cross the border}} back <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> would put on my college jacket on and since the gringo would see that you were a student, he would let you through". Rubén Aguirre worked many times as a gardener in El Paso to make ends meet.|$|R
6000|$|I was in despair. <b>Then,</b> suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> how one fright {{could destroy}} another fright, and I frowned {{up at him}} and shouted sternly: ...|$|R
60|$|I rose heavily, and {{suddenly}} bethought {{me of my}} utter lack of money. It dismayed me for a moment. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> the mule, and determined that I must go afoot.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} an effort I refrained from putting my lips to kiss her at that moment {{as she looked at}} me with womanly dignity and tenderness. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> and said: ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not catch}} his drift for the moment; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b> The {{carpenter}} was the Finn, the Jonah, the warlock who played tricks with the winds and despitefully used poor sailormen.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} {{improved}} since {{you saw him}} last; for <b>then,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> rightly, you found him 'lazy, cross, selfish," [...] and conceited.'" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to turn to on the spot, and I was ashamed to go home. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> opportunely <b>remembered</b> something.|$|R
6000|$|... "But she won't be lovely a bit the more. She'll {{grow old}} all the same, and take to drink very like. When she's got a red {{nose and a}} pimply face, and a sharp tongue, you'd be glad enough to see her at the wash-tub <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> an old song as {{my father used to}} sing, but my mother couldn't endure to hear it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Buell {{fired the}} slash. Penetier is burning. Dick and Hiram sent {{me back to}} the pool below, and then didn't come. They got caught--oh!... I'm afraid--lost!... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> you fellows. The fire's coming--it's awful--we must fly!" ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Collinson and Mr. Furness, of the Thunderer, {{offered to}} serve his Lordship, which made me bethink that I, too, would have need of some one. 'Twas <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> Singleton, who had passed from my mind.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> {{and looked}} {{hard at the}} speaker. The last {{sentence}} was justified, but he differed greatly from one's idea of the typical lawyer. He was not even neatly dressed, and his manner singularly lacked the preciseness of the legal practitioner.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{that some}} of my men essayed to {{restrain}} me, which to my passion was as the wind to a blaze. I cracked my whip about their heads, commanding them to keep their distance lest they were minded to share his castigation. And so fearful an air must I have worn, that, daunted, they hung back and watched their leader's punishment in silence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! poor Diane! you {{sometimes}} recollect her <b>then?</b> If <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> right, {{you used to}} agree with her better than with your little spouse, cousin!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> {{the terrible}} story I had to tell, for {{in my own}} happiness I had forgotten everything that went before. I suddenly became grave.|$|R
