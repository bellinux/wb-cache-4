5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually {{many of the young}} men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of their aunt Margaret in 1530, Mary was asked by her eldest brother, Emperor Charles V, to assume the {{governance}} of the Netherlands and guardianship over their nieces, Dorothea and Christina of Denmark. As governor of the Netherlands, Mary faced riots and a difficult relationship with the Emperor. Throughout her tenure she continuously attempted to ensure peace between the Emperor and the King of France. Although she never enjoyed governing and asked for permission to resign several times, the Queen succeeded in creating a unity between the provinces, as well as in securing for them a measure of independence from both France and the Holy Roman Empire. After her final resignation, <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> Queen moved to Castile, where she died.|$|E

5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|In 1533, {{at the age}} of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, {{second son}} of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Throughout his reign, Henry {{excluded}} Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine {{played a key role in}} the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.|$|E
5|$|When the rioters {{arrived at}} John Taylor's other house at Moseley, Moseley Hall, they {{carefully}} moved {{all of the}} furniture and belongings of its current occupant, <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> Dowager Lady Carhampton, a relative of George III, {{out of the house}} before they burned it: they were specifically targeting those who disagreed with the king's policies and who, in not conforming to the Church of England, resisted state control. The homes of George Russell, a Justice of the Peace, Samuel Blyth, one of the ministers of New Meeting, Thomas Lee, and a Mr. Westley all came under attack on the 15th and 16th. The manufacturer, Quaker, and member of the Lunar Society Samuel Galton only saved his own home by bribing the rioters with ale and money.|$|E

His jaw was so badly deformed (an extreme example of the so-called Habsburg jaw) that he could barely speak or chew. Fearing <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged {{to such an extent that}} at times he was not expected to be clean. When his illegitimate half-brother John of Austria the Younger obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair.|$|E
25|$|The {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} carrack {{in the morning}} of October 18, when most of the crew was on the shore and could not return to the ship in time. This left only about 80 Europeans on the flagship, along with an uncounted number of black slaves and Chinese merchants taking refuge on board. The Japanese boats focused on boarding the larger carrack, and at one point climbed aboard from the stern and shot a musket at Pereira, denting his helmet. The Japanese then made their way into the great cabin, briefly holding the captain-major hostage and carrying off his writing desk before being repelled. The flotilla's focus on the carrack left it exposed to the Portuguese galleon, which was able to support the carrack by catching the Japanese flotilla in the two ships' crossfire. The cannons wrought much havoc in <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> Japanese boats that the Hirado forces, after losing 3 ships and over 70 men, in addition to over 200 wounded, withdrew to their base crestfallen. The battle lasted two hours. The victorious carrack, suffering only 8 lives lost, set sail for Macao at the end of November.|$|E

500|$|With {{dawn and}} dusk constituting {{prominent}} themes of his landscapes, Friedrich's own later years {{were characterized by}} a growing pessimism. His work becomes darker, revealing a fearsome monumentality. The Wreck of the Hope—also known as The Polar Sea or The Sea of Ice (1823–24)—perhaps best summarizes Friedrich's ideas and aims at this point, though in such a radical way that the painting was not well received. Completed in 1824, it depicted a grim subject, a shipwreck in the Arctic Ocean; [...] "the image he produced, with its grinding slabs of travertine-colored floe ice chewing up a wooden ship, goes beyond documentary into allegory: <b>the</b> <b>frail</b> bark of human aspiration crushed by the world's immense and glacial indifference." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ideas of}} Swedish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg (and his disciple Louis Claude de Saint-Martin) {{are central to}} Louis Lambert. Madame de Staël is {{impressed}} by Lambert when she finds him in a park reading Swedenborg's metaphysical treatise Heaven and Hell (1758); the Swedish writer's ideas are later reproduced in Lambert's own comments about mind, soul, and will. Primary among these is {{the division of the}} human into an [...] "inward" [...] and [...] "outward" [...] being. The outward being, subject to the forces of nature and studied by science, manifests itself in Lambert as <b>the</b> <b>frail,</b> frequently sick boy. The inward being, meanwhile, contains what Lambert calls [...] "the material substance of thought", and serves as the true life into which he gradually moves throughout the novel.|$|E
