40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} automated assessment of biscuit bake has been developed. The system employs monochrome imaging and histogramming techniques to classify product samples as underbaked, correctly baked or overbaked. Two products have been investigated. Product "A" exhibits uneven browing {{due to the}} formation of blisters. An intensity histogram suitably characterises the overall browning and the prototype system classifies samples of product "A" with an error rate comparable to that of a <b>trained</b> <b>inspector.</b> Product "B" browns most heavily on the perimeter on the biscuit. A boundary-distance histogram is used to classify samples of product "B". In this case also, the system performance is comparable with a <b>trained</b> <b>inspector.</b> 1 INTRODUCTION Inspection of baked goods is important to ensure correct taste, texture and appearance. Such inspection is normally performed by <b>trained</b> <b>inspectors</b> who examine the product and report unacceptable product. A major problem of this approach is the sub [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Brownawell {{was born}} in Grundy County, Missouri; {{his father was a}} farmer and <b>train</b> <b>inspector.</b> He earned a double baccalaureate in German and {{mathematics}} (with highest distinction) in 1964 from the University of Kansas, and after studying for a year at the University of Hamburg (at which he met Eva, the woman he later married) he returned to the US for graduate study at Cornell University. His graduate advisor, Stephen Schanuel, moved to Stony Brook University in 1969, and Brownawell followed him there for a year, but earned his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1970. That year, he joined the Penn State faculty, and he remained there until his retirement in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{better known}} actor was an actor named Kuk, {{who was always}} so {{consumed}} with his role that he continued to live it even after the curtain went down. For instance, he once played Maryša so ingeniously, that he even made the prompter Standa Křeček cry during the play. Yet even though the viewers applauded this absolute playing, {{the work of the}} theatre was often in jeopardy. For instance,after Maryša,no one from the ensemble would go and drink coffee with Kuk.Kuk was seen to take on every characteristic of the character he was to play, including authentic depression and hysteria.At another time,after playing Gogol's [...] "The Inspector General", Kuk disappeared,and his colleagues re-united with him on a train, where he was checking their tickets (Note the Czech words for The Inspector General and a <b>train</b> <b>inspector</b> are the same, yet their meanings are entirely different).|$|E
50|$|John North, a {{struggling}} writer, is eloping with his mistress (Susan) following an incidental quarrel {{with his wife}} that morning who's frustrated that her husband refuses employment offered by her father, considering their perilous finances. After meeting Susan in London, he detects they are being followed both {{in the street and}} at the railway cafe where they have a cup of tea, though Susan is dismissive of his concerns. Once they are on the train, he still can't rid himself of his unease as they sit discussing their new life together. North is guilt ridden while recollecting the quarrel and feels affection for his wife. Seeing Susan is asleep, North goes out into the corridor to try and gather his thoughts and it is then he again sees the man he believes has been following them. At this point, North hears from a <b>train</b> <b>inspector</b> that they are approaching a point on the line noted earlier by North to be near his property. Troubled by his escapade and suspicious of the man following them, North sees an opportunity of an exit from his dilemma at a point when the carriage is fogged up with steam and pulls the emergency communication cord to stop the train. As the train stops, he jumps off and traces his way to his property. The train is stopped {{just a couple of minutes}} away from his house. When he gets there, he finds his wife, Carol Valerie Hobson, waiting for him with expectation. Feeling a burst of relief and love for her, they chat and embrace.|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} artificial {{neural network}} system for assessing the bake level of biscuits has been implemented. We present performance results and compare the neural network approach with a statistical method {{and the performance of}} the <b>trained</b> <b>inspector.</b> The neural network system performs comparably with the other methods. 1 Introduction Inspection of baked products is very important for food manufacturers, as it ensures correct taste, texture and appearance. This task is normally performed by <b>trained</b> <b>inspectors</b> who examine the product and report unacceptable product. Human inspectors, however, provide subjective judgements that are prone to both shortterm and long-term variations. Digital image processing systems, in contrast, provide objective appearance assessments. When digital image processing is combined with {{artificial neural network}}s (ANNs), the resulting system has the potential to learn objective assessment criteria from presentations of acceptable and unacceptable product samp [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the responses of semitrained sensory assessors to parameters traditionally used in the sensory analysis of hake and to compare their performance with that of <b>trained</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Appropriate statistical methods were used to validate this objective. The study was carried out with whole gutted hake stored for 7 and 12 days in a controlled atmosphere consisting of 60 %/ 15 %/ 25 % (CO 2 /O 2 /N 2), followed by conventional storage in ice. The hake stored under the CA conditions were preserved better than the control hake at 7 days and at 12 days the difference was even more in favor of the CA storage. Ten parameters evaluated in the sensory tests could be reduced to five with no loss in essential information. The evaluations of the semitrained assessors largely correlated with those of <b>trained</b> <b>inspectors.</b> A model using five parameters and semitrained assessors could be routinely used to evaluate the quality of cooked hake previously stored in ice.

50|$|A {{study of}} the visual {{inspection}} of small integrated circuits found that the modal duration of eye fixations of <b>trained</b> <b>inspectors</b> was about 200 ms. The most accurate inspectors made the fewest eye fixations and were the fastest. When the same chip was judged more than once by an individual inspector the consistency of judgment was very high whereas the consistency between inspectors was somewhat less. Variation {{by a factor of}} six in inspection speed led to variation of less than a factor of two in inspection accuracy.

In Michigan, for example, a change in the law was sought by a legislator who was also a funeral director, after discovering that negligent disposal of a body was not a crime in that state.

40|$|The {{reform of}} the school {{inspection}} system in Poland has introduced the idea of evaluation to Polish schools. Probably {{the most important element}} of that reform is the new system of <b>training</b> school <b>inspectors</b> responsible for the external evaluation of schools. More than three years of experience with that new training system shows that still {{there is a lot of}} confusion concerning the understanding of the evaluation process among school <b>inspectors</b> <b>trained</b> for evaluation system. The authors claim that this is the most important obstacle in promoting evaluation as a crucial element in the process of school development and the main reason for the mistakes and problems that the new school evaluation system is facing. The paper presents an attempt to describe different understandings of school evaluation among school inspectors and to show the impact that those understandings may have on the process of the introduction of evaluation to the Polish school system. To find out what is the understanding of evaluation, the authors used the concept of metaphor, assuming that metaphors can help to explore unknown understandings better than more traditional methods. School <b>inspectors</b> <b>trained</b> to serve the role of ‘evaluators’ within the new inspection system were asked to finish in a few words the sentence: Evaluation is like…. The metaphors used by inspectors were then categorized and thinking about evaluation connected with certain types of metaphors was characterized. The paper gives deeper description of those different understandings, trying at the same time to show how they can influence practice of evaluators during external evaluation process that takes part in schools. The authors claim that good understanding of different ways of thinking about evaluation gained through analysis of metaphors used by inspectors can be a very good basis for drawing some recommendations for those responsible for the system of <b>training</b> <b>inspectors</b> for evaluation as well as for policy makers responsible for changes in the school inspection system in Poland and in other countries...|$|R
