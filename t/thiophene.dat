25|$|Pyrrole is a colorless {{volatile}} liquid that darkens readily upon {{exposure to}} air, {{and is usually}} purified by distillation immediately before use. Pyrrole has a nutty odor. Pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle, like furan and <b>thiophene.</b> Unlike furan and <b>thiophene,</b> it has a dipole in which the positive end lies {{on the side of}} the heteroatom, with a dipole moment of 1.58D. In CDCl3, it has chemical shifts at 6.68 (H2, H5) and 6.22 (H3, H4). Pyrrole is weakly basic, with a conjugate acid pKa of −3.8. The most thermodynamically stable pyrrolium cation (C4H6N+) is formed by protonation at the 2 position. Substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example, tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pKa of +3.7. Pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the N–H position, with a pKa of 17.5.|$|E
25|$|The Feist–Benary {{synthesis}} is {{a classic}} way to synthesize furans, although many syntheses have been developed. One of the simplest synthesis methods for furans is the reaction of 1,4-diketones with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) in the Paal–Knorr synthesis. The <b>thiophene</b> formation reaction of 1,4-diketones with Lawesson's reagent also forms furans as side products. Many routes exist for the synthesis of substituted furans.|$|E

Early postulates toward the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr furan synthesis suggested that the <b>thiophene</b> was achieved by sulfurization of the furan product. Campaigne and Foye showed that treatment of isolated furans from the Paal-Knorr furan synthesis with phosphorus pentasulfide gave inconsistent results with the treatment of 1,4-dicarbonyls with phosphorus pentasulfide, which ruled out the sulfurization of a furan mechanism and suggests that the reaction proceeds via sulfurization of a dicarbonyl, producing a thioketone.|$|E

25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, <b>thiophene,</b> and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five membered aromatic rings that contain heteroatoms. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Thiophene</b> is {{considered}} to be aromatic, although theoretical calculations suggest that the degree of aromaticity is less than that of benzene. The [...] "electron pairs" [...] on sulfur are significantly delocalized in the pi electron system. [...] As a consequence of its aromaticity, <b>thiophene</b> does not exhibit the properties seen for conventional thioethers. [...] For example, the sulfur atom resists alkylation and oxidation. However, oxidation of a <b>thiophene</b> ring is thought to {{play a crucial role in}} the metabolic activation of various thiophene-containing drugs, such as tienilic acid and the investigational anticancer drug OSI-930. In these cases oxidation can occur both at sulfur, giving a <b>thiophene</b> S-oxide, as well as at the 2,3-double bond, giving the <b>thiophene</b> 2,3-epoxide, followed by subsequent NIH shift rearrangement. [...] Oxidation of <b>thiophene</b> by trifluoroperacetic acid also demonstrates both reaction pathways.
