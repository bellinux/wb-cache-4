5000|$|<b>Forums</b> - <b>The</b> <b>forums,</b> which reside at I-Mockery.net, {{have always}} been a hotspot {{for a wide variety of}} people, many of which who come simply to argue with others for the sake of some good laughs. For years, it was well known that any {{newcomers}} would receive [...] "the newbie beatdown" [...] FROM EVIL ROBOT, WHO RULES in which all the self-proclaimed [...] "veteran" [...] mockers would verbally tear these people apart. These days, newbies come in by the truckload and do not seem to have to endure the same initiation mockeries that their predecessors did. <b>The</b> <b>forums</b> have gone through a variety of changes: First they were hosted in a very basic forum format with InsideTheWebs free forum program. During this time period, <b>the</b> <b>forums</b> existed solely for readers from the Winky section of I-Mockery to argue about vegetarianism vs. meatatarianism and straight-edgers. <b>The</b> <b>forums</b> then opened up to all of I-Mockerys viewers when it moved to the ezboard software, which was free at first, but ezboard soon began charging to remove ads. With the large number of people visiting <b>the</b> <b>forums,</b> <b>the</b> fees eventually became too outrageous, so I-Mockery moved to <b>the</b> phpBB <b>forum</b> format until <b>the</b> software proved to no longer be stable. <b>The</b> <b>forums</b> are currently running using vBulletin software, which has been fully integrated with the rest of the site.|$|R
