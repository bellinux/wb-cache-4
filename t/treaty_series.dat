It was registered in the League of Nations <b>Treaty</b> <b>Series</b> on January 19, 1922. Both countries had re-established their independence in the aftermath of World War I and did not have well-defined borders. They waged the Polish–Lithuanian War over territorial disputes in the Suwałki and Vilnius Regions. At the end of September 1920, Polish forces [...] defeated the Soviets at the Battle of the Niemen River, thus militarily securing the Suwałki Region and opening the possibility of an assault on the city of Vilnius (Wilno). Polish Chief of State, Józef Piłsudski, had planned to take over the city since mid-September in a false flag operation known as Żeligowski's Mutiny.|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} of this <b>treaty</b> was a <b>series</b> of disputes about the border. In Thurgau, {{it was felt}} that the Tägermoos belonged to the canton, and so Thurgau raised taxes from the landowners. Baden disagreed and demanded freedom from Swiss taxation in the Tägermoos; in 1821 Baden even started raising toll on the road to Tägerwilen. Similar disputes existed in other areas on the High Rhine, for example Diessenhofen and Büsingen am Hochrhein. In these cases had belonged to Swiss monasteries before 1803 and were now held by Baden.|$|R

These were however handed over, as UN Trustee Territories, to the British at the end of the first World War with the signing of the Versailles <b>Treaty.</b> After a <b>series</b> of plebiscites, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province, and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French speaking Cameroon.|$|R

Still, today [...] "a substantial number of treaties are not registered, mainly due to practical reasons, such as the administrative or ephemeral charter of some treaties." [...] Non-registered treaties are not necessarily secret, since such treaties are often published elsewhere.

5000|$|The Numbered Treaties (or Post-Confederation <b>Treaties)</b> are a <b>series</b> {{of eleven}} <b>treaties</b> signed between the Aboriginal peoples in Canada (or First Nations) and the reigning monarch of Canada (Victoria, Edward VII or George V) from 1871 to 1921. [...] These {{agreements}} {{were created to}} allow the Canadian government to pursue settlement and resource extraction in the affected regions, which include modern day Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories. These treaties provided the Dominion of Canada large tracts of land in exchange for promises made to the Aboriginal people of the area. These terms were dependent on individual negotiations and so specific terms differed with each treaty.|$|R
50|$|Treaty of Prenzlau or Peace of Prenzlau (Vertrag von Prenzlau, Frieden vo Prenzlau, Vergleich von Prenzlau) may {{refer to}} several <b>treaties</b> during a <b>series</b> of wars between the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania fought {{for control of}} Pomerania-Stettin, and {{possession}} of the Uckermark in the 15th century. The First Peace of Prenzlau ended a war fought between 1445 and 1448, while the Second Peace of Prenzlau ended a war fought between 1466 and 1468.

25|$|The New York Times ran {{the story}} in a broader piece {{detailing}} the likelihood that {{key members of the}} IRA and Sinn Féin were marked for death, and the story was heavily covered by the Irish press which used the episode as an effective propaganda tool. Six years later, after Arthur Griffiths' death, Collins' assassination and the Anglo-Irish <b>Treaty,</b> a <b>series</b> of articles charting Collins' life appeared in the Cork Observer, with Hardy being the subject of one section of the serialisation. Political cartoons of the time generally portray the incident as hugely undesirable for the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, and the parliamentary discussion which followed led to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, being ridiculed by Irish Nationalist MPs such as Joseph Devlin and Jeremiah McVeagh. A scathing attack on English tactics in Ireland by Annan Bryce, with specific reference to Hardy, was published in The Times in November 1920; this is the only known contemporary mention of the incident in the English press with several English newspapers choosing to ignore many of the British Government's negative activities in Ireland during the period.|$|R

The mission, which included two Chinese ministers, an English and a French secretary, six students from Peking, and a considerable retinue, arrived in the United States in March 1868. Burlingame used his personal relations with the Republican administration to negotiate a relatively quick and favorable <b>treaty.</b> In a <b>series</b> of speeches across the country, he displayed eloquent oratory to advocate equal treatment of China and a welcoming stance toward Chinese immigrants.

40|$|The {{cessation}} of testing of any nuclear explosive devices in all environments {{is the goal}} of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In order to assure compliance with such a treaty, an international monitoring system has been proposed. This system will include seismic, infrasound, hydroacoustic and radionucleide monitors located throughout the world. The goal of this system is the detection of any nuclear test. In preparation for this <b>treaty,</b> a <b>series</b> of monitoring system tests, focusing primarily on seismic observations, have been undertaken. The most recent of these tests, Group of Scientific Experts Technical Test Three (GSETT- 3), provides valuable data for assessing future monitoring systems. During the course of this experiment, seismic events associated with earthquakes, nuclear explosions and mining explosions have been recorded. This presentation will discuss the numbers and types of mining explosions triggering the system, in a particular area. Possible implications for the mining industry will be explored. 1.

50|$|However {{when the}} {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia in August by the Soviet Union delayed ratification around the world, Israel's internal division and hesitation over the treaty became public. The Johnson administration attempted to use the sale of 50 F-4 Phantoms to pressure Israel to sign the treaty that fall, culminating in a personal letter from Lyndon Johnson to Israeli PM Levi Eshkol. But by November Johnson had backed away from tying the F-4 sale with the NPT after a stalemate in negotiations, and Israel would neither sign nor ratify the <b>treaty.</b> After the <b>series</b> of negotiations, U.S. {{assistant secretary of defense}} for international security Paul Warnke was convinced that Israel already possessed nuclear weapons.

5|$|The Peace of Philocrates {{eventually}} {{broke down}} as hostilities reignited between Athens and Macedonia. Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace <b>treaty,</b> delivered a <b>series</b> of speeches encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian hegemony over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by Athens and Thebes, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. In the aftermath the federation of Greek states {{known as the}} League of Corinth was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as strategos (i.e. commander-in-chief) for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, Philip was assassinated before he could begin the campaign, a task that instead fell to his son and successor, Alexander the Great.|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} {{an empirical}} framework for analysing {{the timing of}} international treaties. A treaty is modelled as a dynamic game among governments that decide on participation in every period. The net benefit of treaty membership increases over time. Spillovers among members and non-members accelerate or delay treaty formation by transforming participation into a strategic complement or substitute, respectively. The predictions of the model inform the estimation of the structural parameters, based on {{a cross section of}} treaty ratification dates. With this approach, I estimate the sign and magnitude of strategic interaction in the ratification of the Montreal Protocol, in the formation of Europe's preferential trade agreements, and in the growth of Germany's network of bilateral investment <b>treaties.</b> Through a <b>series</b> of counterfactual experiments, I explore different mechanisms that give rise to strategic interaction in the formation of these treaties...|$|R
