5|$|It {{culminated in}} a period during 1937 when all the powers where {{prepared}} {{to give up on}} non-intervention. Ciano complained to his government that Italian forces in Italy were ready but not being used; the Soviet Union was not prepared to discuss belligerent rights; Delbos was considering proposing mediation by Roosevelt and the Pope, whilst simultaneously preparing French war plans; Britain's new Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, saw securing a friendship with the Italian Benito Mussolini as a top priority. Eden confided he wished Franco to win, so Italian and Germany involvement would be scaled back; Chamberlain considered Spain a troublesome complication <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> By the end of July 1937, the Committee was in deadlock, and the aims of a successful outcome to the Spanish Civil War was looking unlikely. Unrestricted Italian submarine warfare began on 12 August. The British Admiralty believed that a significant control effort was the best solution, of four which were put forward, in response to attacks on British shipping. On 27 August it was decided by the Committee that naval patrols did not justify their expense and would be replaced, as planned, with observers at ports.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature of Things in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study by}} Kliegel et al. (2008), it was shown that motivational state {{affected}} performance in two age groups (three-year-olds and five-year-olds) completing the same prospective memory task. There was no difference for the two age groups when motivation was high but performance of the three years old was reduced when motivation was low. If a person considers a task to be unimportant or is affected by fatigue, {{they will not be}} motivated to remember the intention. Less attention will be given to relevant cues and the memory is more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> Therefore, prospective memory can be enhanced by avoiding low motivational states.|$|E

500|$|The revolutionary {{faces at}} least two special problems. First, the {{transformation}} back into naked power occurs when revolutionary power {{has been around for}} a long period without achieving a resolution to its key conflict. At some point, the original goal of the creed tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten,</b> and consequently, the fanatics of the movement change their goals and aspire toward mere domination (Russell 1938:92). Second, the revolutionary must always deal with the threat of counter-revolutionaries, and is hence faced with a dilemma: because revolutionary power must by definition think that the original revolution was justified, it [...] "cannot, logically, contend that all subsequent revolutions must be wicked" [...] (Russell 1938:87).|$|E
500|$|Ascanio was {{expected}} to be the lesser of the works for the wedding celebration, second to Hasse's opera Ruggiero. However, the 72-year-old Hasse was out of touch with current theatrical tastes, and although his opera was praised by the Dowager Empress Maria Theresa, its overall reception was lukewarm, especially compared to the triumphant success of Ascanio. Leopold expressed delight at this turn of events: [...] "The archduke has recently ordered two copies", he wrote home. [...] "All the noblemen and other people constantly address us in the street to congratulate Wolfgang. In short! I'm sorry, Wolfgang's Serenata has so crushed Hasse's opera that I can't describe it." [...] Hasse was gracious about his eclipse, and is said to have remarked that the boy would cause all others <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|E

When Amy {{explains}} that she had recently witnessed the Doctor's death, River reveals that the Doctor lied {{when he said he}} told her his name; instead he had said [...] "Look into my eye". The Doctor had asked the Teselecta to masquerade as him at Lake Silencio, and the Doctor and his TARDIS had been miniaturised within it. Elsewhere, the Doctor takes Dorium's head back to where it was stored and explains that his perceived death will enable him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> as he had been getting [...] "too big" [...] and drawing too much attention. As the Doctor leaves, Dorium warns of the prophecies that still await him and the question which Dorium calls out after him: [...] "Doctor who?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Eternal World {{is a place}} {{similar to}} the afterlife where a person's [...] "other self" [...] awaits. Anyone can access it, though it is only {{accessible}} once one has lost his or her grounding in the real world. It {{may be necessary to}} form a pledge with someone in the real world as a guide to the Eternal World, but one's memories surrounding the pledge become vague. A grace period can be granted between when the pledge is made and when someone goes to the Eternal World. Once the process has started, nothing can prevent someone from going to the Eternal World, and returning to the real world is difficult. Someone about to leave to the Eternal World starts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> approximately one week before going, and the amount of time before someone forgets differs based on how much someone thinks about the person leaving. However, he or she is remembered the moment that person returns. If a strong emotional bond is established in the real world before leaving, a person in the Eternal World can be returned after approximately one year.|$|E
500|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Lightning has disappeared, {{and all but}} Serah {{believe that}} she died with Vanille and Fang to save Cocoon. In reality, Lightning was brought to Valhalla, capital of the Goddess Etro, {{as a direct result}} of Etro's {{releasing}} her and the others from their condition as l'Cie. These events had distorted time and erased Lightning from history after Cocoon's fall. Hoping to atone for the deaths she caused as a l'Cie, Lightning chooses to stay in Valhalla and protect the dying Etro from Caius Ballad, an immortal man with a grudge against Etro. Lightning eventually asks Noel Kreiss and Serah to help her stop Caius from ending time, which he plans to do by releasing [...] "chaos", a supernatural energy controlled by Etro, into the mortal world. Serah and Noel travel forward in time to fix distortions in history caused by Caius' interference, and Serah eventually dies when history is restored. In the DLC episode Requiem of the Goddess, Lightning is defeated by Caius and loses hope after learning of her role in Serah's death. Lightning is comforted by Serah's spirit, who asks not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> Vowing to preserve Serah's memory, Lightning turns to crystal, which prevents her from being affected when Etro's death releases chaos.|$|E

500|$|The {{main focus}} of the game {{revolves}} around Personas, avatars projected from one's inner self that resemble mythological figures and represent the fa√ßades worn by individuals to face life's hardships. Each Persona possesses its own skills, as well as strengths and weaknesses to certain attributes. As Personas gain experience from battle and level up, that Persona can learn new skills, which include offensive or support abilities used in battle, or passive skills that grant the character benefits. Each Persona can carry up to eight skills at a time, with older skills needing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> {{in order to learn}} new ones. Whilst each of the main party members have their own unique Persona, which transforms into a stronger form after maxing out their Social Link, the protagonist has the [...] "Wild Card" [...] ability to wield multiple Personas, which he can switch between during battle to access different movesets. The player can earn new Personas from Shuffle Time, with the protagonist able to carry more Personas as he levels up. Outside of the dungeons, the player can visit the Velvet Room, where players can create new Personas, or summon previously acquired Personas for a fee. New Personas are created by fusing two or more monsters to create a new one, which receives some of the skills passed down from its material monsters. The level of Personas that can be created are limited by the protagonist's current level. If the player has built up a Social Link relating to a particular Arcana, then a Persona relating to that Arcana will receive a bonus upon creation.|$|E
500|$|Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, {{representative}} in parliament for Tralee (who is raising {{a body of}} men for his Majesty's service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys , clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer's dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [...] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [...] The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [...] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [...] most happy circumstance {{of my life to}} be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [...] the globe [...] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten?</b> No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [...] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{regression}} hypothesis, two similar approaches developed. Cohen started to conduct several studies {{on his own}} to determine [...] "whether the last things learned are, in fact, the first things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten,</b> and whether forgetting entails unlearning in reverse order from the original learning process" [...] (Cohen 1975: 128). He observed the attrition of Spanish, as the second language, among school children during the summer vacation. Cohen's results supported {{the regression}} hypothesis and his last-learned-first-forgotten thesis. It supported the idea that some things, which are learned last, are the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> when the learner has no input of the target language anymore.|$|E
2500|$|The linguistic-feature {{hypothesis}} {{was introduced by}} Andersen (Andersen 1982). He claims that second languages or foreign languages that share more differences with the respective mother tongue than similarities are more endangered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> than those similar to the L1. Another point is the attrition of components, which are less [...] "functional", [...] "marked" [...] or [...] "frequent" [...] compared to other elements (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130). This hypothesis is more differentiated and complex than the regression hypothesis because it considers aspects from first- and second-language acquisition research, language contact and aphasia research and the survey of pidgin and creole languages (M√ºller 1995). By means of this hypothesis research, it tries to detect the aspects of language that are first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|E
