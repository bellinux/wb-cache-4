5|$|Scully is {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts the worm out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E
5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E

5|$|Nomination {{forms are}} {{sent by the}} Nobel Committee to about 3,000 {{individuals}}, usually in September {{the year before the}} prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award. The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names. The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.|$|E
5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|At the house, the Doctor is {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have extrasensory perception (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. The Doctor is attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E

5|$|In the city, {{they are}} escorted to their hotel by {{agents of the}} Bordurian secret police, who have been ordered to monitor the duo by police chief Colonel Sponsz. Aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> monitored, Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house, where Bianca Castafiore is performing. When police come searching for them, they hide in Castafiore's closet; when Sponsz comes to visit Castafiore in her {{dressing}} room, Tintin is able to steal papers that will secure Calculus' release from the fortress of Bakhine from his coat pocket. After disguising themselves as officials from the Red Cross, Tintin and Haddock {{are able to get}} Calculus released from prison and with him escape from Borduria in a tank. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva, and that he had left them at home all along; he destroys the plans so that they cannot be used to create a weapon.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chameleon}} and anole {{species are}} able to voluntarily change their skin colours. Different chameleon species {{are able to}} change different colours which can include pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise and purple.

25|$|The {{presence}} of photoreceptor cell types in an organism's eyes do not directly imply <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> used to functionally perceive color. Measuring functional spectral discrimination in non-human animals is challenging {{due to the}} difficulty in performing psychophysical experiments on creatures with limited behavioral repertoires who cannot respond using language. Limitations in the discriminative ability of shrimp having twelve distinct color photoreceptors have demonstrated that having more cell types in itself need not always correlate with better functional color vision.|$|E

25|$|Arvire {{is eager}} to fight in person, but the Druids dissuade him and hide him in an {{underground}} chamber instead. The Roman army, led by Messala and Vellinus, arrives in search of Arvire. Vellinus is worried about his brother; Irvin may have betrayed their plot. Roman soldiers bring news <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> overwhelmed by a British counterattack led by Irvin. Messala rushes off to lead the defence, leaving Vellinus to search for Arvire. Vellinus is now beginning to regret his part in the plot.|$|E
25|$|A few archeologists are {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot {{be traced to}} any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories {{at the time of}} European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories. Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such {{as in the case of}} the Spirit Cave mummy; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.|$|E
25|$|While {{ecotourism}} agencies {{claim to}} help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people {{do not see the}} tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive commercialization and commodification of their culture.|$|E

He soon discovers that she is a CRS employee and that her apartment was staged. Christine tells Nicholas <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> watched. Nicholas attacks a camera, and armed CRS troops begin to swarm the house and fire upon them. Nicholas and Christine are forced to flee. Christine tells Nicholas that CRS has drained his financial accounts by using the psychological tests to guess his passwords. In a panic, Nicholas calls his bank and gives a verification code to check his account balance—zero. Just as he begins to trust Christine, he realizes she has drugged him. As he loses consciousness, she admits that she is actually part of the scam and that he made a fatal mistake by giving up his verification code.|$|E
25|$|Activities and {{functions}} of R are highly confidential and declassification of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The Secretary (R) reported to the Vohra Committee that R offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of military, economic, scientific and political intelligence. R monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar {{as they relate to}} their involvement with narco terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if there is evidence to suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R's responsibility to monitor their activities.|$|E

25|$|User {{privacy in}} China {{is not as}} cut-and-dry {{as it is in}} other parts of the world. China, reportedly, has a much more {{invasive}} policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government. The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, are using their access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to decide if they value the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN to unblock websites that are blocked.|$|E

500|$|The series marks Bacon's {{first attempt}} at {{depicting}} lone figures in rooms. For him, the key aspect was that {{it appeared that the}} subject felt isolated and unobserved, and had abandoned the need to present an outward face. He believed that under these circumstances all pretence falls away, and the social being becomes the sum of its neuroses, which Bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare-bones features: a mouth, ears, eyes, a jaw. According to Russell, [...] "the view out front ceases to be the only one, and our person is suddenly adrift, fragmented, and subject to strange mutation." [...] Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting, the figures are always posed, and usually seemingly aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> portrayed. This conceit is abandoned in Bacon's series.|$|E
