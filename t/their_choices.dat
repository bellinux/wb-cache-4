5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> were predestined.|$|E
5|$|The show's lifelines {{sometimes}} used corporate sponsorship. The Phone-a-Friend lifeline {{was sponsored by}} the original AT throughout the run of the ABC primetime show and in the first season of the syndicated version, then by the current AT for the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, Ask the Audience was sponsored by AOL, which allowed users of its Instant Messenger to add the screen name MillionaireIM to their buddy list and receive an instant message with the question and the four possible answers, to which the users replied with <b>their</b> <b>choices.</b> In addition, the Ask the Expert lifeline was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds.|$|E
5|$|When {{casting the}} many {{characters}} of Pride and Prejudice, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton {{were looking for}} actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could also play the Regency period. <b>Their</b> <b>choices</b> for the story's protagonists, 20-year-old Elizabeth Bennet and 28-year-old Mr Darcy, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.|$|E

5|$|In mid-June, Benfica {{restricted}} <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> {{to former}} Espanyol manager Luis Fernández and Italian national team manager Giovanni Trapattoni. Negotiations with Fernández failed, but on 17 June, club president Luís Filipe Vieira announced that Benfica {{had signed a}} new manager but did not name him. On 5 July, {{a day after the}} end of the UEFA Euro 2004, Benfica announced Trapattoni as manager. The 65-year-old Italian started his managerial career in 1974 and came to recognition at Juventus, where he became one of Italy's greatest managers, the only one to have won all UEFA club competitions and the Intercontinental Cup. To assist him, he brought fitness coach Fausto Rossi and goalkeeping coach Adriano Barbin, while Álvaro Magalhães remained as assistant manager.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series of question, or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>choices.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{follow-up}} experiment involved shoppers {{in a supermarket}} tasting two different kinds of jam, then verbally explaining <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> while taking further spoonfuls from the [...] "chosen" [...] pot. The pots were rigged so that when explaining <b>their</b> <b>choice,</b> the subjects were tasting the jam they had previously rejected. A similar experiment was also done with tea. Another variation involved subjects choosing between two objects displayed on PowerPoint slides, then explaining <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> when the description of what they chose has been altered.|$|R

50|$|Before 1976 {{there was}} growing {{dissatisfaction with the}} Marriage Act as it {{restricted}} people to choose between a Christian marriage that was usually performed in a church and solemnised by an Officiating Minister, or to a secular marriage in a Registry office where the number of guests was very restricted. From 1973 the Humanist Society of New Zealand lobbied the government for a change to the Marriage Act seeking the right of people to have marriage ceremonies of <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> with a celebrant of <b>their</b> <b>choice</b> held {{in a place of}} <b>their</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{advantage}} of psychedelic drugs in exploring the unconscious {{is that a}} conscious sliver of the adult ego usually remains alert during the experience. Throughout the session, patients remain intellectually alert and remember their experiences vividly. In this highly introspective state, they also are actively cognizant of ego defenses such as projection, denial, and displacement as they react to themselves and <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> {{in the act of}} creating them.|$|E

5000|$|The problem also {{exists in}} Instant-runoff voting, though it is reduced, because voters {{are allowed to}} rank <b>their</b> {{candidate}} <b>choices,</b> with <b>their</b> vote transferring to <b>their</b> second <b>choice</b> if <b>their</b> first <b>choice</b> does not win, and to <b>their</b> third <b>choice</b> if <b>their</b> second <b>choice</b> does not win, and so on.

25|$|Gender/ Sexuality- All of {{the major}} {{characters}} in the novel are female. The male characters that do exist are often portrayed as untrustworthy, or are using the female characters for money, sex, or some other object. Additionally, both Anna and Alyona are unrelentingly chastised by their mothers for <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> in partners. This creates a tension between {{the male and female}} characters, and often drives the male characters from the apartment, the main space of the novel.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the pick}} order usually {{corresponds}} to the conference standings, the bowls {{are not required to}} make <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> strictly according to the won-lost records; many factors influence bowl selections, especially the likely turnout of the team's fans.

If a team is selected for the one of the access bowls or playoff, the bowl with the No. 2 pick will have the first pick of the remaining teams in the conference.|$|E

25|$|Most taxes—including {{income tax}} and sales tax—can have {{significant}} deadweight costs. The {{only way to}} avoid deadweight costs in {{an economy that is}} generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change economic incentives. Such taxes include the land value tax, where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply, a lump sum tax such as a poll tax (head tax) which is paid by all adults regardless of <b>their</b> <b>choices.</b> Arguably a windfall profits tax which is entirely unanticipated can also fall into this category.|$|E
25|$|Principled: Individuals who bargain {{this way}} seek {{integrative}} solutions, {{and do so}} by sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions, motives, {{and needs of the}} people involved. They separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of personal will. They base <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> on objective criteria rather than power, pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{voting for}} one {{candidate}} by marking an “x” on their ballots, electors would rank <b>their</b> <b>choices</b> for the candidates running in their constituency by placing numbers {{next to the}} names of the candidates on the ballot. If a candidate received an absolute simple majority of votes, that candidate would be elected. If not, the candidate with the least number of votes was dropped and the second choices were allocated among the remaining candidates. This procedure would be repeated until a candidate received a majority of votes.|$|E
