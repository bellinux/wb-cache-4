5|$|All {{members of}} the class entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of <b>the</b> <b>U</b> class {{received}} chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. A few {{members of the}} class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw <b>the</b> <b>U</b> class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid’s Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. <b>The</b> <b>U</b> class represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive {{due to the fact that}} they were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>U</b> {{class was}} {{designed}} in the mid-1920s for production {{at a time when}} more obsolete 4-4-0 locomotives were withdrawn, and derived from Maunsell’s earlier SECR K (“River”) class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The first 20members of <b>the</b> <b>U</b> class were rebuilds of the K class locomotives, one of which was involved in the Sevenoaks railway accident. A further 20U class locomotives were built in 1928 to fill the gap in cross-country and semi-fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class. The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be interchangeable with other Maunsell-designed classes.|$|E

Magnus Okuonghae scored the other goal for <b>the</b> <b>U's</b> as Jordan Obita sealed a draw for the away team with a late strike.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Us</b> 9 {{protein is}} a {{phosphorylated}} membrane protein {{present in the}} lipid envelope of pseudorabies virus (PRV) particles in a unique tail-anchored type II membrane topology. In this report, we demonstrate that the steady-state residence of <b>the</b> <b>Us</b> 9 protein is in a cellular compartment {{in or near the}} trans-Golgi network (TGN). Through internalization assays with an enhanced green fluorescent protein epitope-tagged Us 9 protein, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> maintenance of <b>Us</b> 9 to <b>the</b> TGN region is a dynamic process involving retrieval of molecules from the cell surface. Deletion analysis of the cytoplasmic tail reveals that an acidic cluster containing putative phosphorylation sites is necessary for <b>the</b> recycling of <b>Us</b> 9 from <b>the</b> plasma membrane. The absence of this cluster results in <b>the</b> relocalization of <b>Us</b> 9 to <b>the</b> plasma membrane due to a defect in endocytosis. The acidic motif, however, does not contain signals needed to direct <b>the</b> incorporation of <b>Us</b> 9 into viral envelopes. In this study, we also investigate the role of a dileucine endocytosis signal in <b>the</b> <b>Us</b> 9 cytoplasmic tail in the recycling and retention of <b>Us</b> 9 to <b>the</b> TGN region. Site-directed mutagenesis of the dileucine motif results in an increase in Us 9 plasma membrane staining and a partial internalization defect. <b>The</b> unique short (<b>Us)</b> region of most alphaherpesvirus ge-nomes contains an open reading frame called <b>Us</b> 9. <b>The</b> <b>Us</b> 9 gene was first described and the protein product was firs...|$|R
