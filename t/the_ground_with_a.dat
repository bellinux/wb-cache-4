5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Queen's Park {{requested}} more land {{for development of}} the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, {{which led to the}} club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along the south side of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pavilion wedged in between. The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed. In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.|$|E
5|$|After {{forcing a}} punt {{to open the}} second half, Alabama scored a {{touchdown}} on its opening possession with a 34-yard touchdown reception by Brad Smelley from McCarron. However, on the ensuing kickoff, Laron Scott returned it 95-yards for a touchdown to cut the lead again to 31–21. Alabama responded on the following drive with Richardson accounting for 46 yards of it on seven carries with a one-yard touchdown run for a 38–21 Alabama lead. In the fourth quarter, Alabama stopped the Eagles at the Crimson Tide eight-yard line after an incomplete Shaw pass on fourth down. From there the Alabama offense began a 15-play, 92-yard drive that took 8:36 to complete with McCarron throwing a four-yard touchdown pass to Smelley for the final points in their 45–21 win. For the game, Richardson had 175 yards on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of rushing touchdowns and one receiving. His one-yard touchdown run {{in the third quarter}} gave Richardson the Alabama single-season rushing touchdown record breaking the previous mark of 19 set by Shaun Alexander in 1999.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> silent, anguished cry. The video ends {{with the death of}} neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E

25|$|After {{their victory}} over Southern Miss, Alabama {{moved into the}} No.8 {{position}} in the AP Poll prior to their game against Florida. Against the Gators, Johnny Musso scored four rushing touchdowns {{en route to a}} 38–0 shutout at Florida Field. After Bill Davis gave the Crimson Tide a 3–0 lead with his first quarter field goal, Musso scored Alabama's next four touchdowns and extended their lead to 31–0.

Mahon had taken the pistol away from him and given it to the constable, asking him to take the prisoner to his house for the wound to be dressed. He had seen nothing of the lady until two or three minutes later he saw her lying at the bar, with a mortal wound, and said he could not help her.|$|E

25|$|The Fulton Surface-To-Air Recovery System {{was used}} to extract {{personnel}} and materials via air. A large helium balloon raised a nylon lift line into the air, which was snagged by a large scissors-shaped yoke attached to {{the nose of the}} plane. The yoke snagged the line and released the balloon, yanking the attached cargo off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shock less than that of an opening parachute. A sky anchor secured the line and wires stretched from the nose to both leading wing tip edges protected the propellers from the line on missed snag attempts. Crew members hooked the snagged line as it trailed behind and attached it to the hydraulic winch, pulling the attached person or cargo into the plane through the rear cargo door.|$|E
25|$|Foulois blamed Beck for {{improper}} {{repairs to}} the craft, and also questioned {{his ability to}} command. However the investigating board, of which both Foulois and Beck were members, ruled that Kelly's death resulted from landing at too high a speed and striking <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wingtip when he attempted a turn. In any event, the army shut down all aviation training at Fort Sam Houston and sent pilots and airplanes to College Park, Maryland, where its first aviation school was about to commence. Beck was ordered there as the instructor on the Curtiss machine in June, but Foulois remained on duty with the Maneuver Division until July 11, when he was reassigned to the Militia Bureau in Washington D.C.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} Anglo-Saxon {{cremation}} is still debated; {{based on an}} examination of cremated remains at Illington, Calvin Wells speculated that at that site, the bodies had been laid out on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pyre then built {{on top of them}} before being set alight. Wells believed that this would explain why the shoulder tips of corpses at the site were not always properly cremated. This idea was criticised by Jacqueline McKinley, who argued that such a process would lack sufficient oxygen to cremate the entire body. Instead she argued that Anglo-Saxon cremation pyres were most likely a criss-cross of timbers filled with brushwood, with the corpse laid on top. The process of cremating the body would likely have been visible to onlookers, creating a connection between living and dead.|$|E

25|$|Javanese {{people are}} {{descendant}} from Austronesian peoples. Temple relief in 9th-century Borobudur shows Javanese houses that were archetype of Austronesian houses: pile foundations, pitched roofs and an extended roof ridge. While these reliefs suggest houses on piles were in common use from the 9th to 12th centuries, between the 13th and 14th century the preferred Javanese style (east and central Java) {{was to build}} on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> raised floor, the form of Javanese house that we know today. This new form resembles the vernacular architecture of eastern Indonesia such as Balinese and Sumbanese houses. Excavations at Trowulan (East Java), the probable site of Majapahit's capital in the 14th century, have uncovered remains of dwellings with permanent materials such as brick floors, foundations for walls and tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|West Virginia {{rushed for}} 517 yards(415 of which {{came in the}} second half) and {{clinched}} their 5th Big East title with 66–21 win over UConn.

Freshman RB Noel Devine also added 118 yards on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> TD. Steve Slaton also went over the 1,000 yard mark on the season for the 3rd straight year. The win clinched the Big East automatic Bowl Championship Series berth, and coupled with the previous day's upset over then #1 LSU by unranked Arkansas, put the Mountaineers {{in a position to}} play for a berth in National Championship game with a win over rival Pitt the next week. The team wore traditional blue jerseys and gold pants.|$|E
25|$|A global {{navigation}} satellite system (GNSS) provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allows small electronic receivers {{to determine their}} location such as longitude, latitude, and altitude to within a few meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites in outer space. Receivers on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fixed position {{can also be used}} to calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments. The first such system was Transit, developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory under the leadership of Richard Kershner. Development of the system for the United States Navy began in 1958, and a prototype satellite,Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960 by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The last Transit satellite launch was in August 1988.|$|E
