5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E

[...] When he described {{the style of the}} album, Gill said, [...] "It doesn't really help matters that as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> mature, the band appear to be indulging their interest in Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb rather more openly, despite lacking either songwriter's way with a winning melody." [...] In his 2003 book The Rough Guide to Rock, Peter Buckley described the album as [...] "a little gushing and overall disappointing".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Lundgren {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the Mongolia-based action adventure, Diamond Dogs. Lundgren portrays the character of Xander Ronson, a mercenary hired {{by a group of}} American fortune hunters to act as their guide and bodyguard, while they search for a priceless Buddhist artifact deep within the Chinese wilderness. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> than they bargained for, however, as they {{come face to face with}} Russian mercenaries also after the artifact. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, {{directed and}} starred in Missionary Man alongside Charles Solomon Jr.. Described as a [...] "modern western" [...] by Lundgren, He plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970's Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later get mixed up in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet he did not want to spend the time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would. Lundgren's co-writer, Frank Valdez's wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there. The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, a southern suburb of Dallas and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.|$|E

50|$|If the Purple Gang {{frequently}} {{attacks the}} Capone Mob, then <b>they</b> will <b>get</b> <b>more</b> turns (because, if the Capone Mob blocks {{and takes the}} next turn, then the Purple Gang gets the next turn; the other four gangs are effectively skipped). Similarly, if the Purple Gang frequently blocks the Bank Robbers, then <b>they</b> will <b>get</b> <b>more</b> turns (again, the other four gangs are effectively skipped). However {{there is always the}} risk that a mob other than the Capone Mob will use family influence or mob power to save that person's mobster. This point emphasizes the importance of alliances with other mobs.|$|R

Then do you take ten men and go next. I will follow you at the same distance with the other five men and the wagons. Order the corporal if attacked to ride through if possible; if not, to fall back to you. Do you do the same. If you are nearly through the valley when you are attacked, dash straight forward. I shall see what is going on, and will turn and ride back with my party, and making a sweep round through the flat country find my way back by some other road.

6000|$|Half-past eleven, {{everything}} {{being ready}} on the Walck Hill, Friedrich's batteries opened there, {{in a sudden}} and volcanic way. Volcanically answered by the Russians, as soon as possible; who have 72 guns on this Muhlberg, and are nothing loath. Upon whom Finck's battery is opening from the north, withal: Friedrich has 60 cannon hereabouts; on the Walckberg, on the LITTLE Spitzberg (called SEIDLITZ HILL ever since); all playing diligently {{on the head and}} south shoulder of this Muhlberg: while Finck's battery opens on the north shoulder (could he but get near enough). Volcanic to a degree all these; nor are the Russians wanting, though <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> and more astonished: Tempelhof, who was in it, says he never, except at Torgau next Year, heard a louder cannonade. Loud exceedingly; and more or less appalling to the Russian imagination: but not destructive in proportion; the distance being too considerable,--"1,950 paces at the nearest," [...] as Tempelhof has since ascertained by measuring. Friedrich's two batteries, however, as they took the Russians in the flank or by enfilade, did good execution. [...] "The Russian guns were ill-pointed; the Russian batteries wrong-built; batteries so built as did not allow them sight of the Hollow they were meant to defend."

You can't blame people I suppose for going where <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> and pay less, and it wasn't till we'd all gone right away to Haggerston that they altered things and put the prices up again. Of course Father lost heart and all that. He didn't know what to do, he'd sunk all he had in the shop; he just sat and moped about. Really,--he was pitiful. He wasn't able to sleep; he used to get up at nights and go about downstairs. Mother says she found him once {{sweeping}} out the bakehouse at two o'clock in the morning. He got it into his head that getting up like that would help him. But I don't believe and I won't believe he wouldn't have seen it through if he could.

60|$|It will {{easily be}} {{perceived}} that {{law in this}} way will be made cheaper to the litigant. Whether or no that may be an unadulterated advantage, I have my doubts. I fancy that the united professional incomes of all the lawyers in the States would exceed in amount those made in England. In America every man of note {{seems to be a}} lawyer; and I am told that any lawyer who will work may make a sure income. If it be so, it would seem that Americans per head pay as much (or more) for their law as men do in England. It may be answered that <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> law for their money. That may be possible, and even yet they may not be gainers. I have been inclined to think that there was an unnecessarily slow and expensive ceremonial among us in the employment of barristers through a third party; it has seemed that the man of learning, on whose efforts the litigant really depends, is divided off from his client and employer by an unfair barrier, used only to enhance his own dignity and give an unnecessary grandeur to his position. I still think that the fault with us lies in this direction. But I feel that I am less inclined to demand an immediate alteration in our practice than I was before I had seen any of the American courts of law.|$|E
