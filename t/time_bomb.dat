He began speaking around 8:10 pm, earlier than usual because he had urgent business in Berlin. He left the hall at around 9:07 pm. About thirteen minutes later, a <b>time</b> <b>bomb</b> which had been concealed inside a pillar behind the speaker's rostrum exploded, killing eight and injuring sixty-three.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a <b>time</b> <b>bomb)</b> for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war <b>time</b> <b>bomb</b> damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E

5|$|The {{band was}} {{travelling}} home to Dublin {{late at night}} after a performance in Banbridge. Halfway to Newry, their minibus was stopped at {{what appeared to be}} a military checkpoint, where gunmen in British Army uniforms ordered them to line up by the roadside. At least four of the gunmen were serving soldiers from the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) but, unbeknownst to the band, all were members of the UVF. While two of the gunmen (both soldiers) were hiding a <b>time</b> <b>bomb</b> on the minibus, it exploded prematurely and killed them. The other gunmen then opened fire on the dazed band members, killing three and wounding two. It is believed the bomb was meant to explode en route, killing the band and framing them as IRA bomb-smugglers, and possibly leading to stricter security measures at the border.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) <b>time</b> <b>bomb</b> {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking <b>time</b> <b>bomb</b> scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E

Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer. Reyes tries {{to find out more about}} McMahon's history and learns that she is a Department of Justice employee and had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans to contaminate the water supply. The Lone Gunmen intercept a call from the captain to Wormus, who tells him to contact the FBI, Knowle Rohrer is nearby eavesdropping. The captain then pulls a gun on the Navy Seal guarding the entrance to the lab, demanding that Nordlinger surrender the project's data. He does not notice Rohrer creeping up behind him. After hearing Reyes' findings, Scully, Reyes and Doggett go to the ship. They expect to meet the captain, but instead find Rohrer. Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the ship, which is abandoned, and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a <b>time</b> <b>bomb</b> on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{search for}} a new label was a long and {{difficult}} process. Several major labels were eager to sign the band, but the band members felt uncomfortable with signing to a major label.

With <b>Time</b> <b>Bomb,</b> the band hoped to have the freedom of an indie label backed by the wider distribution of a major label.|$|E

50|$|The main {{differences}} between logic <b>bombs</b> and <b>time</b> <b>bombs</b> {{is that a}} logic bomb may have a timing function implemented into it as a failsafe if the conditions are not met in a certain time period (it may delete itself or activate its payload using the timing system), while <b>time</b> <b>bombs</b> only use timing functions to activate themselves.Time bombs, once activated, will unload their payload (which may be malicious) {{in a similar way}} logic bombs deliver their payloads to the target. The main difference between <b>time</b> <b>bombs</b> and logic bombs, and how their payload differs from a fork bomb, is that a fork bomb has no payload and instead creates copies of itself to do damage.|$|R

25|$|The further {{development}} of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative.
