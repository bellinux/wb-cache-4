5|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, British public-service {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 resolved {{to improve the}} accuracy and depth of their representation of <b>transgender</b> people. My Transsexual Summer was the first <b>transgender</b> programme they created after making this resolution. Channel 4 broadcast the series in November 2011. It was rebroadcast in the UK on More4 in 2012, and on ABC2 in Australia in 2013. Also in 2013, two of the show's participants themselves started making documentary short films and videos about <b>transgender.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leelah Alcorn (November 15, 1997 – December 28, 2014) was an American <b>transgender</b> {{girl whose}} suicide {{attracted}} international attention. Alcorn had posted {{a suicide note}} to her Tumblr blog, writing about societal standards affecting <b>transgender</b> people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for <b>transgender</b> people.|$|E
5|$|An all-transgender netball {{team from}} Indonesia competed at the 1994 Gay Games in New York City. The team {{had been the}} Indonesian {{national}} champions. At the 2000 Gay Games VI in Sydney, netball and volleyball were the two sports with {{the highest rates of}} <b>transgender</b> athletes participating. There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as <b>transgender.</b> They came from places like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Teams with <b>transgender</b> players were allowed to participate in several divisions including men's, mixed and transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.|$|E

Parts II and III explore respectively the placement and treatment issues that complicate the incarceration of the <b>transgendered.</b> Corrections authorities, through indifference or incompetence, foster a shockingly inhumane daily existence for <b>transgendered</b> prisoners.

5|$|My Transsexual Summer is a British documentary-style reality {{series about}} seven <b>transgender</b> people in {{different}} stages of transition. For five weekends {{in the summer of}} 2011, they stay together in a large holiday home in Bedfordshire, England, where they meet and help each other with some of the struggles that <b>transgender</b> people face. Between these weekend retreats, they go back to their lives and real-world challenges.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown higher rates of same sex {{attraction}} in intersex people, with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, thus research on intersex subjects {{has been used to}} explore means of preventing homosexuality. As an experience of being born with sex characteristics that do not fit social norms, intersex can be distinguished from <b>transgender,</b> while some intersex people are both intersex and <b>transgender.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Transgendered</b> {{individuals}} and their families face legal risks that most families do not, at least in part, because state laws are often unclear about whether or under what conditions <b>transgendered</b> individuals are permitted to marry the individuals whom they love. Challenges to the validity of marriages involving the <b>transgendered</b> may arise {{under a variety of}} circumstances, ranging from cases in which individuals may have hidden or may not even have known that they were <b>transgendered</b> until after their marriages, to cases in which the individuals had already transitioned and had explained their personal histories to their partners before they were married. Where such marriages are contested, a number of issues may have to be resolved including the validity of the marriage, parental status, and who should have custody of or visitation with any of the children raised by the parties. This Article focuses on the spousal and parent-child relationships of <b>transgendered</b> individuals. Regrettably, much of the law is still unclear. While most states specifyr the conditions under which a <b>transgendered</b> individual can have his or her birth certificate modified to reflect his or her self-identified sex, states have been much less clear about how local marriage laws apply to <b>transgendered</b> individuals. In many states, there is no express policy with respect to whether a <b>transgendered</b> person will only be permitted to marry someone of the opposite sex of his or her self-identified sex or, instead, someone of the opposite sex of his or her birth sex. Current law in most states is intolerable, either because it fails {{to take into account the}} actual lives of the <b>transgendered,</b> or because it is simply indeterminate...|$|R
40|$|On average, one <b>transgendered</b> {{individual}} is reported murdered every month. This high statistic {{does not account}} for hate crimes against <b>transgendered</b> individuals that are either not reported or are misrecorded as crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias. In this Book Review, the author explores this epidemic of violence against <b>transgendered</b> individuals. Juxtaposing two prominent hate crimes-the murders of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming and Brandon Teena in Nebraska-the author exposes the critical differences between hate crimes against <b>transgendered</b> individuals and hate crimes based on sexual orientation and the disparity between the institutional responses each receives. The author argues that these differences warrant the conclusion that hate crimes against <b>transgendered</b> individuals should not be left to fall under the 2 ̆ 2 actual or perceived sexual orientation 2 ̆ 2 provision of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, but can and should receive express, individualized attention under the Act 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 actual or perceived gender 2 ̆ 2 provision...|$|R
5|$|On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America {{announced}} that <b>transgender</b> boys {{would be allowed}} to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant's birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision would be based on the gender listed on the application. Joe Maldonado became the first openly <b>transgender</b> boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. In 2016, he was rejected from the Boy Scouts for being <b>transgender,</b> but the policy was changed after his story became nationally known.|$|E

Critically, All That Glitters was negatively received and a ratings disappointment across syndicated television networks.|$|E
40|$|State {{and federal}} {{employment}} anti-discrimination statutes {{have failed to}} adequately protect transsexual and <b>transgendered</b> individuals in the workplace. Although advancements {{have been made in}} recent years regarding the protection of sexual minorities, transsexual and <b>transgendered</b> employees continue to receive sporadic and noncomprehensive protection. Various approaches have been taken to extend protection against discrimination to these individuals, including the utilization of disability protection statutes, the expansion of anti-discrimination statutes, and the protection of transsexual and <b>transgendered</b> individuals as a class; however, these approaches have proven flawed in providing adequate protection. An examination of anti-discrimination law shows that these measures, while perhaps desirable, are not necessary to protect transsexual and <b>transgendered</b> persons. This Article argues that existing legislation already provides a basis for protecting these minorities. That is, courts should recognize discrimination against transsexual and <b>transgendered</b> individuals as classic sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and corresponding state anti-discrimination statutes...|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} an {{investigation}} of how the <b>transgendered</b> practice their gender on their bodies. We have investigated the <b>transgendered</b> perception of gender through determining how the body {{can be seen as}} sexed {{as a result of the}} Repressive Hypothesis. Furthermore, we have taken the perspective of gender as performative and through the unravelling of the transgendered’s actions and thoughts we have established how the performative behaviour constitutes their gender. For this we have utilised theories of Michel Foucault and Judith Butler. Our empirical data has consisted of conducted interviews with Danish <b>transgendered</b> and secondary data from official institutions. From this we have concluded that the <b>transgendered</b> subject practices gender in the interplay of internalising and performing the already existing gender options...|$|R

5|$|After the Don't Ask, Don't Tell {{policy was}} lifted September 20, 2011, the academy began admitting and {{retaining}} openly gay cadets. By March 2012, cadets were forming a gay-straight alliance group called Spectrum. By March 2015, Spectrum had two faculty and 40 cadet members, {{a mixture of}} gay, straight, bi, and undecided. According to a Vanity Fair essay, the LGBT cadets were well accepted. After the ban on <b>transgender</b> service members was lifted in 2016, the Class of 2017 saw the first openly <b>transgender</b> graduate. However, she was denied a commission and was honorably discharged.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or <b>transgender</b> people. Critics said that <b>transgender</b> people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
