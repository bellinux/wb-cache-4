5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E

5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour {{that was}} {{reinforced}} by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. This assertion has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J. S.

5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility.

5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> rookies remained reserved.

5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from Gerolmo's {{original}} draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman {{and created the}} character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman {{was based on an}} actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a CBS News cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives.

5|$|Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came {{to believe}} that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a {{daughter}} named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.|$|E
