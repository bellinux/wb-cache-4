25|$|In 2007, DNA {{evidence}} {{questioned the}} identification of the body found in Crippen's cellar {{that was supposed to be}} Crippen's wife. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the remains discovered in his cellar were, in fact, those of a male person.

50|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{perioperative}} PION is unknown. Many risk {{factors have been}} identified, all of which contribute to optic nerve hypoxia. Alone, none of these risk factors is enough to cause PION. However, in susceptible patients, {{a combination of these}} risk factors produces devastating blindness. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> PION is a disease of multifactorial origin.|$|R
50|$|Taken together, <b>this</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{the surface}} of Venus is geologically young. The impact crater {{distribution}} appears to be most consistent with models that call for a near-complete resurfacing of the planet. Subsequent to this period of extreme activity, process rates declined and impact craters began to accumulate, with only minor modification and resurfacing since.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, {{excavations}} by the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust {{focused on}} nine {{samples of the}} Dyke near Chirk. Radio carbon dating of redeposited turf placed the construction between the years 541 and 651, and lower layers of construction are dated to as early as 430. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the Dyke {{may have been a}} long-term project by several Mercian kings.|$|R

An antiserum precipitated glycosylated derivatives of the lectin but not a deglycosylated peptide.

50|$|In 2006, {{remains of}} figs were {{discovered}} {{in a house in}} Jericho dated to 9400 BC. The figs are of a mutant variety that cannot be pollinated by insects, and therefore the trees can only reproduce from cuttings. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> figs were the first cultivated crop and mark the invention of the technology of farming. This occurred centuries before the first cultivation of grains.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this {{endemism}} is found when looking at brown bears in the Alexander Archipelago. These bears exhibit a lower genetic diversity than bears found inland. Additionally, genetic tests have shown {{them to be more}} closely related to present-day polar bears than mainland bears. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> they may have inhabited the Archipelago for at least 40,000 years, with habitable refugia existent throughout this time.|$|R
2500|$|Two men {{developed}} temporary referred sensation {{after suffering}} from shingles. [...] Here, the referred sensation {{occurred in the}} areas previously affected by the shingles.

50|$|It is {{generally}} assumed {{that during the}} Interregnum, the Baptists and other dissenting groups absorbed the British Anabaptists. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the early relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were quite strained. In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued an anathema against the Anabaptists. Even today there is still very little dialogue between Anabaptist organisations (such as the Mennonite World Conference) and the Baptist bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{geological}} strata {{in which}} the remains lay was dated to anywhere between 10,000 and 35,000 years old, predating the last ice age. From a geological dating standpoint, <b>this</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the skeletal remains dated back to the glacial period. This information would make the remains a significant finding {{on the grounds that}} the glacial period was a time when, previously, no humans were known to inhabit North America.|$|R

25|$|Oral {{nicotinamide}} {{has been}} promoted as an over-the-counter drug {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's dementia.

Bacterial adherence {{was found to}} be mediated by nonpiliated adhesins with antigen(s) which probably are shared by the strains tested. Although a strong attachment-inhibiting activity arises in their nasal secretions, volunteers remained colonized by N. lactamica. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the eradication of Neisseria carriage is a multifactorial event...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} dietary isotope {{evidence in}} Turkana Basin hominin species {{comes from the}} Australopithecus anamensis. <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> their diet consisted primarily of C3 resources, possibly however {{with a small amount}} of C4 derived resources. Within the next 1.99- to 1.67-Ma time period, at least two distinctive hominin taxa shifted to a higher level of C4 resource consumption. At this point, there is no known cause for this shift in diet.|$|R

50|$|In a {{mouse model}} of {{intracellular}} infection, L. monocytogenes induced PD-L1 protein expression in T cells, NK cells, and macrophages. PD-L1 blockade (using blocking antibodies) resulted in increased mortality for infected mice. Blockade reduced TNFα and nitric oxide production by macrophages, reduced granzyme B production by NK cells, and decreased proliferation of L. monocytogenes antigen-specific CD8 T cells (but not CD4 T cells). <b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> PD-L1 {{acts as a}} positive costimulatory molecule in intracellular infection.|$|R
50|$|The spikelets, the {{inflorescence}} {{found on}} all grasses, measure 3 to 5.5 cm {{in length and}} are typically a subtle reddish-purple in colour. Each spikelet contains 5 to 8 florets. Flowering is currently very poorly understood. During the research done on the plant by Triplett, Weakley and Clark when describing the species, only one flowering specimen was encountered. While flowering is rare in most bamboos, <b>this</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> it may be even less common in hill cane.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the Shaikan {{discovery}} is very substantial, and its significance is accentuated {{by the low}} success rate of wildcat exploration worldwide, which {{has been on a}} five to six-year downtrend. The Chief Financial Officer of Gulf Keystone indicated in March 2015 that the likely recovery rate from Shaikan was likely to be significantly above the 12% level implied by the auditors in 2014.

In rural Honduras, however, this relationship is positive. Estimated coefficients are 0.598 for covered wage earners and 0.442 for uncovered self-employed workers, and significant for the former.

30|$|Muse cells, induced to {{grow into}} 3 D cultured skin in vitro, have the {{capacity}} to give rise to mature melanocytes, contributing to tissue regeneration after engraftment into damaged skin [28]. The authenticity of Muse-derived melanocytes is supported both molecularly and morphologically. Muse-derived melanocytes were pigmented, as compared to the negative control.
