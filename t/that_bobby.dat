5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and <b>that</b> <b>Bobby</b> was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

25|$|Indicative of the {{importance}} of the grinder is <b>that</b> <b>Bobby</b> Clarke and Mike Eruzione, both grinder-style players, played major roles in their respective country's victories over the offensively skilled Soviet Union national team.

25|$|Jack Kramer, on {{the other}} hand, who became a {{world-class}} player in 1940 and then beat Gonzales badly in the latter's first year as a professional, has stated that he believes that although Gonzales was better than either Laver or Sampras he was {{not as good as}} either Ellsworth Vines or Don Budge. Kramer, who had a long and frequently bitter relationship with Gonzales, rates him only as one of the four players who are second to Budge and Vines in his estimation.

Manager Jim Cornette brought in a man <b>that</b> <b>Bobby</b> Eaton was familiar with, having feuded with him extensively in Memphis – Stan Lane. When Lane joined Eaton to form the new Midnight Express it put the final nail in the coffin of the Fabulous Ones, ending their 5-year run. Keirn, meanwhile, would run a wrestling school in Florida, which he trained future superstars like Mike Awesome, Dennis Knight, Diamond Dallas Page, and Dustin Rhodes, to name a few.|$|E
25|$|Green {{had four}} Top 15 {{finishes}} in 2004 (including a seventh-place {{finish in the}} Subway 500) and he would fail to finish in 11 races, the most DNF's in one season of his career; five were caused by engine failures while the other six were caused by crashes.

He failed to finish in the Top 10 the entire year, with his best finish being 11th in the Coca-Cola 600.

5000|$|Bobby later {{described}} his brother as [...] "bohemian" [...] and [...] "carefree".

Nonetheless, during performances of the song, Harry would do dance numbers, which caused laughter among audience members and Bobby himself. Harry's last professional recording was singing background (tenor) on Bobby's album, Lookin' for a Love Again, released in January 1974. The title track would find success for a third time after its release.|$|R

25|$|Hurst's footballing {{career began}} when he was apprenticed to West Ham United {{at the age of}} 15. Manager Ted Fenton first {{selected}} him for a senior game in a Southern Flootlight Cup tie with Fulham in December 1958. He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid £7 a week with a £20 signing on fee. His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3–1. He made only two further appearances in the 1959–60 season, and realised <b>that</b> <b>Bobby</b> Moore was making better progress in the same position than he was. He played six times in the 1960–61 campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket. In April 1961 Ron Greenwood took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness.|$|E
