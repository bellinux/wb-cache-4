5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living <b>things</b> <b>could</b> come to be.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three <b>things</b> <b>could</b> be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{has some}} similarity to modal realism in philosophy, {{which is the}} view that the possible worlds used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the actual world. Unlike the possible worlds of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem or the Quantum Zeno effect. Also, while the worlds of the many-worlds interpretation all share the same physical laws, modal realism postulates a world for every way <b>things</b> <b>could</b> conceivably have been.|$|E
25|$|Shank pursues Cesar to his villa, {{where the}} final {{showdown}} begins. As they fight, {{more of his}} past is revealed. Shank would have obeyed the order to kill Eva, but upon arriving Eva revealed that she was carrying his child. Shank explains that Cesar had always taught him {{the importance of family}} and so he did not kill her. Cesar replies that if he had known this <b>things</b> <b>could</b> have gone differently. As the fight nears its end, Shank is stabbed and shot multiple times in the chest. Despite this, he still manages to kill Cesar. The game ends as Shank walks towards the sunset, his revenge fulfilled.|$|E

25|$|During occupation, ethnic {{tensions}} were raised and nationalism grew. The Malayans were thus {{on the whole}} {{glad to see the}} British back in 1945, but <b>things</b> <b>could</b> not remain as they were before the war, and a stronger desire for independence grew. Britain was bankrupt and the new Labour government was keen to withdraw its forces from the East as soon as possible. Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, <b>things</b> <b>could</b> {{only get}} better for Northamptonshire {{and they started}} by {{recruiting}} widely from other counties and countries, bringing in Freddie Brown from Surrey; the Australians Jock Livingston, George Tribe and Jack Manning; the New Zealander Peter Arnold; and the Cambridge University opening bat and leg-spinner Raman Subba Row. Brown joined as captain in 1949, and led the team to six place {{in his first season}} after previous years of disappointment. Under the new leadership of Dennis Brookes (a stalwart batsman for over 20 years), finished second in 1957, their best finish for 45 years. This was mainly due to the bowling attack of Frank Tyson, Vincent Broderick, Michael Allen, George Tribe and Manning. Northamptonshire were widely considered the best team in England in the late 1950s and early 1960s, during this time Keith Andrew, Northants best ever Wicket-keeper broke the records of most victims in an innings and a season.|$|E
25|$|Aurangzeb became viceroy of the Deccan {{again after}} he was {{replaced}} by Dara Shikoh {{in the attempt to}} recapture Kandahar. Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two jagirs (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from Malwa and Gujarat {{in order to maintain the}} administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son. Shah Jahan insisted that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> be improved if Aurangzeb made efforts to develop cultivation. Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan to extend to the Deccan the zabt revenue system used in northern India. Murshid Quli Khan organised a survey of agricultural land and a tax assessment on what it produced. To increase revenue, Murshid Quli Khan granted loans for seed, livestock, and irrigation infrastructure. The Deccan returned to prosperity, but too slowly to satisfy the emperor.|$|E

500|$|During 2014, {{speculation}} about Mitt Romney staging a third presidential run increased. [...] Ann Romney's {{reaction was to}} say it would not happen: [...] "Done. Completely. Not only Mitt and I are done, but the kids are done. Done. Done. Done." [...] However, like her husband, she left open the slight possibility that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> change in this regard, and by January 2015 was reported by Romney advisors to be supporting the possibility as he seriously considered a third presidential bid. [...] In any event, he soon decided against making a run.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} criticized by filmmaker and {{lecturer}} Claude Lanzmann, {{director of the}} nine-hour Holocaust film Shoah, who called Schindler's List a [...] "kitschy melodrama" [...] and a [...] "deformation" [...] of historical truth. [...] "Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced {{that there is a}} ban on depiction [...] ", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust {{through the eyes of a}} German, saying [...] "it is the world in reverse." [...] He complained, [...] "I sincerely thought that there was a time before Shoah, and a time after Shoah, and that after Shoah certain <b>things</b> <b>could</b> no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|In an April 2002 interview, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who are {{believed}} to have organized the attacks, said Flight 93's intended target was the United States Capitol, not the White House. During the planning stage of the attacks, Mohamed Atta, the hijacker and pilot of Flight 11, thought the White House might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from Hani Hanjour (who hijacked and piloted Flight 77). Mohammed said al-Qaeda initially planned to target nuclear installations rather than the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, but decided against it, fearing <b>things</b> <b>could</b> [...] "get out of control". Final decisions on targets, according to Mohammed, were left {{in the hands of the}} pilots.|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{his book}} The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television, John Kenneth Muir said it was {{necessary}} for Cameron to set Dark Angel in the future because the prosperity of the U.S. in 2000 [...] "offered little possibility for crime, squalor and other societal problems". While criticizing certain plot elements in the second season as contributing to the show's downfall, Muir said that larger factors in the ratings drop were the September 11 attacks, the Enron scandal, and the depletion of the U.S. government's surplus, which changed Dark Angel's [...] "futuristic vision of recession in a Third-World America" [...] from an interesting, far-fetched premise to a [...] "depressing reminder that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> still get worse".|$|E
500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously concerned about my future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to happen to me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way <b>things</b> <b>could</b> go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} also {{intended to}} tease {{the audience that}} after the brutal killing of Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) from the previous episode, they would think that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> not get worse for the team, until the nuclear threat in the finale. The scene where the team breaks Connie out was intended to show the audience that the protagonists {{are willing to go}} to extreme measures to stop serious threats. Cross wanted to make it a very pure Spooks episode by setting up the entire plot in one scene, and then include a chase throughout London between FSB officers and the main characters. Cross enjoyed creating the FSB team featured in the episode, especially as he created them as a Russian version of the Spooks protagonists, but also make their base much more lit with windows. The bomb defusal scene was originally set at a graveyard, but the producers decided {{it would be best to}} set it underground. Though it took several rewrites, the script remained [...] "fundamentally the same" [...] throughout the writing process.|$|E

500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus {{not on the}} way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way <b>things</b> <b>could</b> be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E
500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of <b>things</b> <b>could</b> be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name Bad Hair Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, [...] "Syndicated Inc.", is a parody of [...] "Misery" [...] by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that <b>things</b> <b>could</b> go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E
