5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E
5|$|In Soviet Russia, a {{splinter}} {{group known as}} the Living Church gained official state recognition {{in place of the}} Russian Orthodox Church in 1922. In the United States, a group of Living Church clergy led by John Kedrovsky attempted to depose ruling American hierarch Bishop Alexander (Nemolovsky). Bishop Alexander, in addition to the political and ethnic struggles of his diocese, had also to deal with mounting Church debt {{as a result of the}} loss of funds from the Russian Church. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> Church property to pay creditors, and was replaced in 1922 by Archbishop Platon (Rozhdestvensky), who had previously served as archbishop of the diocese from 1907 to 1914.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1871 life in Paris had {{returned}} to normal, and Offenbach ended his voluntary exile. His new works Le roi Carotte (1872) and La jolie parfumeuse (1873) were modestly profitable, but lavish revivals of his earlier successes did better business. He {{decided to go back}} into theatre management and took over the Théâtre de la Gaîté in July 1873. His spectacular revival of Orphée aux enfers there was highly profitable; an attempt to repeat that success with a new, lavish version of Geneviève de Brabant proved less popular. Along with the costs of extravagant productions, collaboration with the dramatist Victorien Sardou culminated in financial disaster. An expensive production of Sardou's La haine in 1874, with incidental music by Offenbach, failed to attract the public to the Gaîté, and Offenbach was forced to sell his interests in the Gaîté and <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> future royalties.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{association}} between the level of fertility {{and the organization of}} homeownership in Western countries. It distinguishes four homeownership regimes, based on the share of owner-occupied housing and access <b>to</b> <b>mortgages.</b> It is argued that one homeownership regime is particularly associated with problematic housing-market entry and, therefore, unfriendly to family formation: the 'difficult' regime, which combines a high share of owner-occupation and low access <b>to</b> <b>mortgages.</b> It is found that countries with this particular homeownership regime have the lowest levels of fertility...|$|R

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> the 1950s, <b>mortgage</b> lenders often earned {{extra income}} by tying fire {{insurance}} policies <b>to</b> <b>mortgages.</b> New laws passed by {{states in the}} late 1940s began to limit this tying relationship. The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division launched an investigation of H.F. Ahmanson in the mid-1950s, but the investigation was dropped.|$|R
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
5|$|Lex {{tries to}} {{initiate}} an employee buyout, and convinces the employees <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> {{their homes to}} help provide the financial resources to complete the buyout. Lionel learns of Lex's plans and buys the Smallville Savings & Loan, so that he may immediately foreclose on all the property when Lex's employees miss their payments. Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien) tests Clark's abilities by setting off a bomb in his truck, while he is inside. Nixon confronts Clark in the Talon coffee shop, but Lex intervenes on Clark's behalf. Nixon follows Clark home and overhears a conversation about Clark's ship being in the storm cellar, and that Lex has the missing piece from the ship. Nixon goes to the Luthor mansion and steals the octagonal key, and immediately returns to the storm cellar with a video camera.|$|E
5|$|Sivaji, an Indian {{software}} architect, {{returns to}} India from the United States. He aims {{to establish a}} non-profit trust called Sivaji Foundation, which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Adiseshan, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt civil service, but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high that he has <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation {{as a result of}} bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji {{falls in love with a}} girl named Tamizhselvi. However, upon asking for his horoscope, an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.|$|E

25|$|Fannie Mae {{makes money}} partly by {{borrowing}} at low rates, and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgages and mortgage backed securities. It borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds, and provides liquidity <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> originators by purchasing whole loans. It purchases whole loans and then securitizes {{them for the}} investment market by creating MBS that are either retained or sold.|$|E
25|$|This is {{sometimes}} called a loan policy and it is issued only <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market {{is made up of}} high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.|$|E

25|$|Redlining is the {{practice}} of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas.

25|$|A {{year after}} the birth of their second child, in 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act was enacted, which brought to Colorado, and Colorado mine-owners, the hope that wildly {{fluctuating}} silver prices would stabilize.

25|$|The title {{industry}} is {{highly dependent on}} real estate markets, which, in turn, are highly sensitive <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> interest rates and the overall economic well-being. During the housing bubble from 2000 through 2006, the industry's revenue more than doubled. As the surge in real estate transactions drove up title insurance revenue—along with a greater incidence of claims—the economic downturn that started in 2007 pared back revenue significantly for several years. To compare, the industry reported nearly $17billion in title insurance premiums in 2005, but volume fell to $9.6billion in 2009.|$|E

The bank's assets were always sufficient to cover its liabilities in the long run, {{but it had a}} liquidity problem because institutional lenders became nervous about lending <b>to</b> <b>mortgage</b> banks following the US sub-prime crisis.
