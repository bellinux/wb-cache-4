40|$|Physically based {{distributed}} hydrological {{models are}} widely used for hydrological simulations in various environments. As with conceptual models, they are limited in data-sparse basins {{by the lack of}} streamflow data for calibration. Short periods of observational data (less than 1  year) may be obtained from fragmentary historical records of previously existing gauging stations or from <b>temporary</b> <b>gauging</b> during field surveys, which might be of value for model calibration. However, unlike lumped conceptual models, such an approach has not been explored sufficiently for physically based distributed models. This study explored how the use of limited continuous daily streamflow data might support the application of a physically based distributed model in data-sparse basins. The influence of the length of the observation period on the calibration of the widely applied soil and water assessment tool model was evaluated in four Chinese basins with differing climatic and geophysical characteristics. The evaluations were conducted by comparing calibrations based on short periods of data with calibrations based on data from a 3 -year period, which were treated as benchmark calibrations of the four basins, respectively. To ensure the differences in the model simulations solely come from differences in the calibration data, the generalized likelihood uncertainty analysis scheme was employed for the automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis. In the four basins, contrary to the common understanding of the need for observations {{over a period of several}} years, data records with lengths of less than 1  year were shown to calibrate the model effectively, i. e., performances similar to the benchmark calibrations were achieved. The models of the wet Jinjiang and Donghe basins could be effectively calibrated using a shorter data record (1  month), compared with the dry Heihe and upstream Yalongjiang basins (6  months). Even though the four basins are very different, when using 1 -year or 6 -month (covering a whole dry season or rainy season) data, the results show that data from wet seasons and wet years are generally more reliable than data from dry seasons and dry years, especially for the two dry basins. The results demonstrated that this idea could be a promising approach to the problem of calibration of physically based distributed hydrological models in data-sparse basins, and findings from the discussion in this study are valuable for assessing the effectiveness of short-period data for model calibration in real-world applications...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{altimeters}} {{have been}} launched {{with the objective}} to monitor changes in sea level and glacial ice sheet topography. More recently, their potential to monitor inland water bodies such as lakes, rivers and wetlands has been recognised. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the accuracy of measuring surface water elevation changes of large multi-channel inland river systems using data from multiple altimetry satellite sensors and different retracking methods. We initially validated satellite altimetry data with in situ gauge data on Lake Argyle and Lake Eildon (Australia), and then investigated data of the only presently operational altimeter, Jason- 2 /Ocean Surface Topography Mission (OSTM), data at six locations on large inland rivers where <b>temporary</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed during 2011 - 2012 floods. Our analysis on Lake Argyle showed that the application of an alternative retracking algorithm significantly improved the agreement of altimeter and gauge data. We also found that the altimeter with the smallest footprint (50 - 90. m) and the highest along-track resolution (40. Hz, ~ 170. m), ICESat, provided more accurate lake water surface elevation measurements (mean. = 0. 00. m, RMSE. = 0. 04. m) than other altimeters, Jason- 2 (mean. = - 0. 04. m, RMSE. = 0. 28. m), Envisat (mean. = 0. 25. m, RMSE. = 0. 42. m), Jason- 1 (mean. = - 0. 04. m, RMSE. = 1. 07. m), GFO (mean. = 0. 5. m, RMSE. = 0. 89. m) and T/P (mean. = 0. 77. m, RMSE. = 1. 5. m). This study also investigated altimetry satellite data accuracy at six Jason- 2 /OSTM ground track sites crossing the Cooper/Diamantina Rivers where water level loggers were installed to collect data during the 2011 - 2012 floods (N. B. ICESat ceased operations in 2009). It is shown that satellite altimetry data is able to simulate moderate to major flood events in these large multi-channel inland river systems (R= 0. 90 - 0. 98). Altimetry data further revealed a variation of water height in the channels across the river system. The general usefulness of satellite altimetry in hydrological applications in remote data sparse regions is confirmed, more specifically to study large multi-channel anabranching river systems such as the Cooper/Diamantina Rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin in Australia and similar systems worldwide where conventional gauging methods are difficult to use. This study also highlights the potential operational applications for monitoring inland flood wave characteristics and hydrodynamic behaviour of remote and multi-channel floodplain systems particularly using the still-operational Jason- 2 platform...|$|R

For Unit 1, as of August 31, water injection has been carried out with the amount of water about 3. 6 m/h, which exceeds the amount of water injection equivalent to decay heat. Temperature of the bottom of the RPV has not shown behavior of continuous increase of temperature over the last one month and stayed under 100 °C, and the reactor has been enabled to be cooled sufficiently by means of a reactor water injection system (Figure II- 2 - 28).

Short-term effects of wind on sea level are evident. Seasonal sea-level fluctuations along the Turkish Straits System are in accord with Black Sea's hydrological cycle. The differential range of the monthly mean sea levels between the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea is highly variable; high during spring and early summer and low during fall and winter. On the average, there is a pronounced sea-level difference (55 cm) along the Turkish Straits System. However, the slope is nonlinear, being much steeper in the Strait of Istanbul. This barotrophic pressure difference {{is one of the most}} important factors causing the two-layer flow through the system. The topography and hydrodynamics of the straits, the dominant wind systems and their seasonal variations make this flow more complicated. For secular sea level changes, a rise of 3. 2 mm/a was computed for Karsiyaka (1935 - 71) and a steady trend (- 0. 4 mm /a) has been observed for annual sea levels at Antalya (1935 - 77). The decreasing trend (- 6. 9 mm/a) at Samsun is contrary to the secular rising trend of the Black Sea probably because of its rather short monitoring period (1963 - 77) ...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{frequency}} {{estimates are}} {{an essential part}} of flood risk management. Methods described in the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) published in 1999, and many subsequent updates, are the industry standard for flood frequency estimation in the UK. Even carefully calculated flood frequency estimates are associated with many sources of uncertainty. These hydrological uncertainties often constitute the most uncertain component in any flood study. Uncertainty, where it is recognised, can lead to difficulty in having confidence in the outputs of studies such as flood map outlines, designs of flood defences or other structures, decisions on new development or information needed for investment planning or insurance. It can also lead to a loss of public credibility. As a result, there is considerable benefit to be gained from any reduction in the uncertainty of flood frequency estimation. The raw material for flood estimation is high quality long-term records of river flow and rainfall. The FEH methods are based primarily on these types of data. There are many supplementary sources of information that can help to refine flood frequency and potentially reduce uncertainty. Examples include long-term flood history, river level records, <b>temporary</b> flow <b>gauges,</b> photographs of flood impacts, information obtained from field visits, measurements of channel width and evidence of flood deposits seen in the landscape (palaeoflood data). These and similar types of information are defined as local data. The FEH Local research project aimed to: quantify the uncertainty of design floods estimated from FEH methods; and, develop procedures and guidance for incorporating local data into flood estimation to reduce such uncertainties. This report describes the review of scientific developments and good practice, and the development of new procedures carried out during the FEH Local project. A companion output from the project is a document, ‘Using Local Data to Reduce Uncertainty in Flood Frequency Estimation’, giving guidance to practitioners on how to estimate uncertainty in flood frequency and how to find and incorporate local data. Following a wide-ranging review of the availability and use of local data, this report focuses on the evaluation and development of procedures for incorporating 2 main types of local data: historical (and palaeoflood) information; and, channel dimensions. A statistical simulation study examines methods for flood frequency analysis using historical data and tests the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty of aspects such as the length of the historical period or the possibility of missing some events. The study recommends a maximum likelihood technique for combining historical and gauged flood data. The technique is able to incorporate either historical floods for which discharges can be estimated or floods for which all that is known is that the discharge exceeded a given threshold. It can also be used with palaeoflood data and this report includes a critical review of the use of palaeoflood data in UK practice. A procedure is presented for estimating the median annual flood using a combination of catchment descriptors and bankfull channel width. This is an extension of a technique presented in the FEH using the same dataset of channel widths. The practitioner guidance explains how to implement these procedures and provides case studies showing how historical data, palaeofloods and several other types of local data can be incorporated in flood studies. The report presents a proposal for a new system to improve access to local data to be integrated with the National River Flow Archive. The development of this system is feasible, given clearly defined limits on the data types to be included and secure funding, with a national remit, both for the establishment and for the long-term operation and maintenance of the system. Also covered in this report is a separate aspect of the FEH Local project, a pilot study to develop high-resolution catchment descriptors and explore the potential for new catchment descriptors to replace or augment some of those currently used in FEH methods. Catchment boundaries and descriptors are derived from a 10 m digital terrain model, considerably more detailed than the 50 m terrain data used in the FEH. Existing FEH catchment descriptors are evaluated for all catchments down to a minimum size of 0. 2 km 2 for a pilot area in north Cumbria. Several new descriptors are proposed, although it is not yet clear that they would necessarily lead to improved flood estimates. There is now a challenge for the flood management sector to put into practice the findings of FEH Local, so that it becomes common practice to seek and exploit local data (rather than, as currently, best practice if it is done at all). This will lead to several benefits: better estimates of design flows; reduced uncertainty; project results that are more robust to challenge; less need to seek reviews and improvement of hydrology studies; and, enhanced public credibility. Ultimately, it can be expected that an outcome will be improved protection of people and property. There are several ways to help meet this challenge, including dissemination of the practitioner guidance and encouragement or requirement of its implementation via appropriate wording of project scoping documents by the Environment Agency and other regulators. Appropriate use of local data should also be required in sector specific guidance or specifications. More rigorous reviews of flood estimates will help to challenge poor practice. There is a need for a change in culture that gets hydrologists out from their computer models more often and into the field. ...|$|R
