5|$|Danny Angel (1920–2009), {{who worked}} in the family {{business}} from the age of 7 until his death at age 89 was the public face of the company. He was the recipient of many awards, including the Jerusalem Prize, Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem, and Notable Industrialist. He was president of the Manufacturers Association of Israel, the Rotary Club of Israel, and the Variety Club of Israel, which he helped found. He had many friends in the political echelon as well. In recognition of their longtime friendship, Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek always gave Danny Angel an honorary spot at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> electoral list. In 2008, mayoral candidate Nir Barkat continued the tradition and placed Angel's name at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> electoral list. Angel's funeral was attended by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu, and other government officials.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

6000|$|Milt was realizing--and hating {{himself for}} realizing--that Bill's face was dirty, <b>his</b> hair linty, <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{trousers}} frayed masses of mud, while Bill chuckled: ...|$|R
60|$|Hoof, woof! said Mooween. And away {{he went up}} {{the hill}} in a desperate scramble, with loose stones rattling, and <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet showing {{constantly}} through the volley of dirt and chips flung out behind him.|$|R
60|$|My uncle hung {{fire for}} a moment {{and it seemed to me}} the fate of nations trembled in the balance. Then he spoke as one who speaks from <b>the</b> very <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart--and I think it was <b>the</b> very <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart.|$|R
25|$|First baseman Carlos Peña {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list on August 6, retroactive to August 1. On July 31, Peña was removed from a game with what was initially described as a foot injury and had not played since. The reason for his placement on the DL was reported as a partial tear of the plantar fascia ligament on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> foot. Relief pitcher Dale Thayer was recalled to fill the vacated roster spot.|$|E
25|$|Brice {{was born}} {{in what is now}} Harrison County, West Virginia. In 1825, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1825. His classmates {{included}} future civil war generals Robert Anderson, Daniel S. Donelson, Benjamin Huger, William R. Montgomery, and Charles F. Smith. He graduated near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class, ranking fortieth out of forty six cadets. Upon graduation he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and served with the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment on frontier duty at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. He served during the Black Hawk War expedition against the Sac Indians in 1831.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{consistently}} ranked near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class, Maxey did {{graduate in}} 1846 and was commissioned a Brevet second lieutenant. He {{was assigned to}} the 7th Infantry Regiment, which was engaged in the Mexican-American War. Maxey joined the regiment in Monterrey, Mexico. Maxey was cited for gallantry and brevetted first lieutenant for his actions in the battles of Cerro Gordo and Contreras in the summer of 1847. He also participated in the battles of Churubusco and Molino del Rey. He received a brevet promotion and was placed in command of a police company in Mexico City.|$|E
60|$|He {{squeezed}} {{the water out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> loose trousers and felt <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wooden leg and arms and head, and finding he had brought all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> person with him he gathered courage to examine closely their surroundings.|$|R

25|$|Goering {{attended}} Horace Mann Junior High School and South High School in Salt Lake City, graduating near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class. After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, he volunteered for {{service in the}} United States Army Air Forces. After passing the required tests, he was accepted for flight training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. He then qualified as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress pilot at Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico. The claim {{that he was the}} nephew of Hermann Göring did not go unnoticed by the FBI.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, Jackson was {{accepted}} to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Because of his inadequate schooling, he had {{difficulty with the}} entrance examinations and began his studies at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> class. Displaying a dogged determination that was to characterize his life, {{he became one of}} the hardest working cadets in the academy, and moved steadily up the academic rankings. Jackson graduated 17th out of 59 students in the Class of 1846. It was said by his peers that if he had stayed there another year, he would have graduated first.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{graduated}} from the Academy in 1887 and was immediately sent to sea as a passed cadet, first aboard the protected cruiser Boston, then aboard the wooden-hulled screw steamer Trenton. In those days, Academy graduates were required to complete two years of satisfactory sea duty before being awarded an ensign's commission. However, due to an 1882 statute {{limiting the number of}} available naval commissions, there were not enough vacancies in the service to retain all of the Academy's graduates. Jackson's poor grades placed him near <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> graduating class, so he was to be cashiered from the Navy upon completing his sea duty.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he {{put down}} his cane, took off his hat, his coat, his waistcoat, his collar, and his cravat and his cuffs; he rolled up his sleeves, he turned up <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trousers, and then taking an axe, he set to work.|$|R

2500|$|The crown prince's physician, William Cormick, {{examined}} the Báb and {{complied with the}} government's request to find grounds for clemency. The physician's opinion saved the Báb from execution for a time, but the clergy insisted that he face corporal punishment instead, so the Báb suffered foot whipping (twenty lashes to <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet).|$|R
25|$|With {{help from}} Liu Yafo (劉亞佛) and Lu Zhiying (盧志英), {{communist}} agents copied the intelligence into four dictionaries and Xiang Yunian (項與年) was tasked with {{bringing it to}} the CSR. The trip was hazardous, since the nationalist forces arrested and executed anyone attempting to cross the blockade. Xiang Yunian (項與年) hid in the mountains, knocking out four of his teeth with a rock and causing his face to swell. Disguised as a beggar, he tore off the covers of the four dictionaries and covered them with spoiled food at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bag. Crossing several blockade lines, he reached Ruijin on October 7, 1934. The intelligence provided by Mo Xiong (莫雄) convinced the communists in the CSR to abandon their base and retreat before Chiang could reinforce his blockade lines with barbed-wire fences. They mobilized trucks and troops, saving themselves from annihilation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, Joseph Smith founded the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{based in part}} on what was said to be information obtained miraculously from the reflections of seer stones. Smith had at least three separate stones, including his favorite, a brown stone he found during excavation of a neighbor's well. He initially used these stones in various treasure-digging quests in the early 1820s, placing the stone in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat and putting his face in the hat to read what he believed were the miraculous reflections from the stone. Smith also said that he had access to a separate set of spectacles composed of seer stones, which he called the Urim and Thummim. He said that, through these stones, he could translate the golden plates that are the stated source of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
25|$|On lap 44 Timo Glock ran wide {{onto the}} grass and <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car hit two {{substantial}} bumps, the second of which caused it to briefly fly {{up in the air}} and land with force sufficient to break the suspension, leaving the monocoque in contact with the ground and unable to be stopped, resulting in a sizable accident. Glock spun twice and came to rest against the wall further down the track. He was forced to retire and the safety car came out for a third time. On the same lap, due to a false signal from the chief mechanic, Barrichello left a pit stop before the fuel hose had been removed from his car. Several mechanics suffered minor injuries. He would also serve a ten-second penalty for this pit stop as it was taken while the pit lane was closed. Ultimately he was disqualified for exiting the pitlane when the red light was on.|$|E

25|$|According to Markandeya Purana, the Brahmin Pravara {{was given}} a magical {{ointment}} {{that allowed him to}} fly. But when he flew to the Himalayas, the ointment was washed away from <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feet keeping him from returning home to his wife. During this time, the nymph Varuthini fell madly in love with him and begged the Brahmin to stay with her forever. But eventually, he rejected her. He prayed to Agni who returned him home safely.|$|R
50|$|Siping {{was invented}} and {{patented}} in 1923 {{under the name}} of John F. Sipe. The story told on various websites is that, in the 1920s, Sipe worked in a slaughterhouse and grew tired of slipping on the wet floors. He found that cutting slits in the tread on <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoes provided better traction than the uncut tread. Another story is that he was a deckhand and wanted to avoid slipping on a wet deck.|$|R
25|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Sirius gives Harry {{a mirror}} he {{originally}} used {{to communicate with}} James {{while they were in}} separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of Two-way Mirrors that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or her face to appear on the caller's mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius's death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in Deathly Hallows when Mundungus Fletcher loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius's mirror to Aberforth Dumbledore, who uses it to watch out for Harry in Deathly Hallows. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus's eye), appears and he sends Dobby, who arrives to help Harry escape from Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage.|$|E
500|$|French fashion {{designer}} Jacques Heim, {{who owned a}} beach shop in the French Riviera resort town of Cannes, introduced a minimalist two-piece design in May 1946 which he named the [...] "Atome," [...] after the smallest known particle of matter. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> design was just large {{enough to cover the}} wearer's navel.|$|E
500|$|Newspapers did {{not release}} Harwood's name until July 2010. On {{the day of}} the incident, he {{appeared}} to have removed his shoulder number and covered <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face with his balaclava. The Daily Mail published an image showing his shoulder ID missing. Simon Israel of Channel 4 News reported {{a detailed description of the}} officer on 22 April 2009; the IPCC sought but failed to obtain an injunction to prevent Channel 4 broadcasting the description, alleging that it might prejudice their inquiry. Fifteen months later, when announcing in July 2010 that no charges would be brought against Harwood, the Crown Prosecution Service still referred to him as [...] "PC A." [...] It was only on that day that newspapers decided to name him.|$|E

60|$|He didn't {{look much}} like a Bridegroom, as {{he stood in the}} Carrier's kitchen, with a twist in his dry face, and a screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the bridge <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nose, and his hands tucked down into <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pockets, and his whole sarcastic, ill-conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the {{concentrated}} essence of any number of ravens. But a Bridegroom he designed to be.|$|R
500|$|Rhapsody in Blue is {{the first}} Fantasia segment with music from an American composer. It {{originated}} in 1992 when director and animator Eric Goldberg approached Al Hirschfeld {{about the idea of}} an animated short set to Gershwin's composition in the style of Hirschfeld's illustrations. Hirschfeld agreed to serve as artistic consultant and allowed the animators to use and adapt his previous works for the segment. Goldberg's wife Susan was art director. Duke is named after jazz artist Duke Ellington. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> toothpaste tube reads [...] "NINA", an Easter egg referencing Hirschfeld's newborn daughter Nina. Rachel was designed after the Goldbergs' daughter and John is based on animation historian and author John Culhane and Hirschfeld's caricature of Alexander Woollcott. Goldberg took Hirschfeld's original illustration of Gershwin and animated it to make him play the piano. Featured in the crowd emerging from the hotel are depictions of Brooks Atkinson and Hirschfeld, along with his wife Dolly Haas. The segment was completed two months ahead of schedule. Despite this, the sequence was so chromatically complex that the rendering process using the CAPS system delayed Tarzan.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{never said}} how he {{produced}} the Book of Mormon, saying {{only that he}} translated {{by the power of}} God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will [...] "come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof". As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For {{at least some of the}} earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the [...] "Urim and Thummim", a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate-colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. [...] After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 when he said he no longer needed it.|$|E

60|$|McGarver, the under-boss, {{was a good}} {{shepherd}} {{among the}} men, though he had recently lost the head foremanship by a spree complicated with language and violence. He looked {{like one of the}} Merian bulls, with broad short neck and short curly hair above a thick-skinned deeply wrinkled low forehead. He never undressed, but was always seen, as now, in heavy shoes and blue-gray woolen socks tucked over <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overalls. He was gruff and kind and tyrannical and honest.|$|R
