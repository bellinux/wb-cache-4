5|$|In 1926, Newt Scamander {{arrives in}} New York City with his magically {{expanded}} briefcase which houses {{a number of}} dangerous creatures and their habitats. When some creatures escape from his briefcase, Newt must battle to correct the mistake, and <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resultant increase in violence, fear, and tension felt between magical and non-magical peoples (No-Maj).|$|E
5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} example of <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave trade, stimulating {{the development of}} the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} trial, freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought {{news of the}} {{massacre}} {{to the attention of}} the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Passage of slaves to the New World.|$|E

50|$|He {{was known}} for {{carrying}} sticks of explosive in his pockets, even producing them while giving testimony in trials, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. Most high explosives are harmless unless used with a detonator, {{but this is not}} generally understood.|$|R
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns {{made to look like}} bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal to remind people of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sex industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus {{is made up of}} dead child prostitutes.|$|E
50|$|After the mid-1980s, {{his poetry}} {{displays}} {{a freedom of}} spirit that can withdraw and objectively examine <b>the</b> futility <b>of</b> life. He coolly examines the changes within reality and <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, with a calm composure that boldly accepts these observations.|$|R
50|$|Hooked on {{sniffing}} gas, glue, lighter fluid, airplane cement, Jesco {{was constantly}} finding himself {{in trouble with}} the law. He landed in the reform school more than once, and it was here that {{he spent most of his}} adolescence, left to endure <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voices.|$|R
50|$|Films {{in the era}} {{used the}} supernatural premise to express <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonic. The Innocents (1961) based on the Henry James novel <b>The</b> Turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Screw. Meanwhile, ghosts were a {{dominant}} theme in Japanese horror, in such films as Kwaidan, Onibaba (both 1964) and Kuroneko (1968).|$|R

25|$|Many {{contemporary}} artists {{continue to be}} haunted by <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. Christian Boltanski's harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{holidays}} of Yom Ha-shoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day), Yom Hazikaron (Israeli Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust, {{the fallen}} soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Cowan Pottery {{works were}} {{generally}} table-top-sized sculptures done in limited editions. Gregory's most famous sculptures {{from this period}} are Nautch Dancer and Burlesque, as well as Salome and Margarita. Salome combines <b>the</b> essential <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> John <b>the</b> Baptist, his beheading, as well as Salome’s veil dance. However, <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event is muted, becoming secondary to an expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line, movement and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drapery and human movement. Salome won first prize at <b>the</b> Cleveland Museum <b>of</b> Art May Show of 1929. Gregory's work for Cowan is characterized by smooth, linear, flowing forms.|$|R
50|$|Charles Peck, <b>the</b> {{only one}} <b>of</b> its sons lost to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First World War, was 19 {{when he died}} in September 1917.

50|$|BloodBlood is {{the most}} {{importance}} metaphor and presence in the novel. <b>The</b> hair-raising accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riot-affected areas and that the writer's notes are at last drenched one night {{as a result of}} which she is unable to complete her book on Delhi brings <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riot very close, almost to the interiors.|$|R
25|$|Levi wrote If This Is a Man to {{bear witness}} to <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazis' attempt to exterminate the Jewish people and others. In turn, he read many {{accounts}} by witnesses and survivors, and attended meetings of survivors, becoming a prominent symbolic figure for anti-fascists in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In {{early summer}} 2009, Harry {{recorded}} some spoken word parts for UK heavy metal band Imperial Vengeance, {{to be included}} on the title track to the album At the Going Down of the Sun.

25|$|Muckrakers were {{journalists who}} {{encouraged}} readers to demand more regulation of business. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906) showed America <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Union Stock Yards, a giant complex of meat processing that {{developed in the}} 1870s. The federal government responded to Sinclair's book with the new regulatory Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
2500|$|Strahorn {{recalled}} <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ravine at Slim Buttes.

50|$|Goodson herself evidently had {{a playful}} side. En route to Boston for her American debut {{she and her}} husband dined with some elderly society ladies, who enquired after their profession. For some days, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bostonians, the two musicians kept up the pretence that they were circus {{performers}} and had a camel called Gertrude in the ship's hold.|$|R
50|$|However, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few {{surviving}} members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original group, the clones who {{are finally}} coming <b>of</b> age reject <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> sexual reproduction in favor <b>of</b> further cloning. <b>The</b> original members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, {{too old and}} outnumbered by the clones to resist, are forced to accept the new social order and the complications that arise.|$|R
25|$|Poetry {{at the end}} of {{the century}} was profoundly marked by the civil wars: pessimism, dourness and a call for retreat from the world predominate (as in Jean de Sponde). However, <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war were also to inspire one Protestant poet, Agrippa d'Aubigné, to write a {{brilliant}} poem on the conflict:Les Tragiques.|$|E
25|$|In August 1943, Krebs {{was drafted}} as an infantryman and {{deployed}} in February 1944 to the Philippines in fighting the Japanese in the Pacific War. In 1946, his book Children of Yesterday, an anecdotal {{history of the}} 24th Infantry Division was published, describing in graphic detail <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting and everyday life of the division’s troops.|$|E
25|$|As {{to other}} works of art, Pablo Picasso painted Guernica in 1937, taking {{inspiration}} from the bombing of Guernica, and in Leonardo da Vinci's The Battle of Anghiari. Guernica, like many important Republican masterpieces, was featured at the 1937 International Exhibition in Paris. The work's size (11ft by 25.6ft) grabbed much attention and cast <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mounting Spanish civil unrest into a global spotlight. The painting has since been heralded as an anti-war work and a symbol of peace in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|He became {{involved}} in organisations pledged to remembering and recording <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps.

25|$|World War I: {{during the}} first three years of World War I, he worked as press {{correspondent}} of El Liberal, and thanks to his detailed chronicles, which came from his courage of getting close to enemy lines, the Spanish readers got to know <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front. A summary of his articles is found in his books: Crónica de la Guerra (War Chronicles, 1915), Reflejos de la Tragedia (Reflections of the Tragedy, 1915), En las Trincheras (Inside the trenches, 1916), and En el Corazón de la Tragedia (At the heart of the tragedy, 1916), among others.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly self-reliant. Though cloaked in a rough exterior, she represents {{a woman who has}} weathered considerable hardship. She has hardly anything in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E
25|$|Although {{death and}} {{destruction}} surrounded her, the Mail’s fledgling war correspondent preferred not to dwell too much on <b>the</b> <b>horrors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siege. She described cycling events held on Sundays and the town’s celebration of Colonel Baden-Powell’s birthday, which was declared a holiday. Despite these cheery events, dwindling food supplies became a constant theme in the stories she {{sent back to the}} Mail and the situation seemed hopeless when the garrison was hit by an outbreak of malarial typhoid. In this weakened state the Boers managed to penetrate the outskirts of the town, but the British stood firm and repelled the assault.|$|E

25|$|Many {{historic}} buildings in Ireland were destroyed during the war, most famously the Custom House in Dublin, which was disastrously attacked on de Valera's insistence, to <b>the</b> <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more militarily experienced Collins.
