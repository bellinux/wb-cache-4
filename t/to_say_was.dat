500|$|The musical {{elements}} of the song also received praise. Drewett stated that Gabriel's singing throughout the song was [...] "clear and powerful". Though Drewett questioned the use of bagpipes, he stated that they heightened the emotional effect of the song. 2013, scholar Ingrid Byerly called [...] "Biko" [...] a [...] "hauntingly powerful" [...] song, with [...] "a hypnotic drumbeat thundering beneath commanding guitar, lyrical bagpipe dirges, and the intense eulogy of Gabriel's voice". A review in Rolling Stone was more critical of the song, saying that the melody and rhythms of the piece were [...] "irresistible", but that the song was a [...] "muddle", and that [...] "what Gabriel [...] <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> mostly sentimental." ...|$|E

[...] The first radio single released from the album was [...] "You Are Everything". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R's Christian AC chart.

500|$|The Hallucination version {{had only}} a basic story concept, having dropped the {{previous}} scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, [...] scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said {{he was responsible for}} this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier [...] "and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>was</b> very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [...] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive." [...] Kawamura added he was very sorry and [...] "even ashamed" [...] that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last canceled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that what he had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> the truth and that {{it was a matter of}} life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

2500|$|The idea of {{a public}} {{employee}} teaching in a religious school, the Court went on <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>was</b> no longer commonly considered to foster a [...] "symbolic union" [...] between Church and State. Noting that the Dissent believed that, in fact, this did foster such a symbolic union, the Court countered by stating that it cannot be shown that such a symbolic union would vanish once the students and teachers were moved off campus. Taking that reasoning to its logical conclusion, it would forbid Title I entirely, as the union would be unavoidable. Further, the Court rejected the idea that Title I would be financing religious indoctrination if instruction could be conducted on religious campuses; Title I specifically notes that {{it is designed to}} [...] "supplement, not supplant" [...] the school's curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, the Mayor of Nagano Shoichi Washizawa {{said that}} it has become a [...] "great nuisance" [...] for the city to host the torch relay prior to the Nagano leg. Washizawa's aides said the mayor's remark was not {{criticism}} about the relay itself but about the potential disruptions and confusion surrounding it.　A city employee of the Nagano City Office ridiculed the protests in Europe, saying [...] "they are doing something foolish" [...] in a televised interview. The City Office officially apologized later and explained what he had wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> [...] "such violent protests were not easy to accept". Also citing concerns about protests as well as the recent violence in Tibet, a major Buddhist temple in Nagano cancelled its plans to host the opening stage of the Olympic torch relay.

2500|$|Green Day: Rock Band was {{generally}} well received by video game critics. Many critics noted the game follows the previous dedication to presentation, audio, and playability that {{were seen in}} The Beatles: Rock Band, though some believed it followed the formula too well to make it indistinguishable from the previous titles. Jack DeVries of IGN {{could not think of}} any easy way to identify the game from other Rock Band titles; [...] "People kept asking me how the game was and all I could think <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> 'It's Green Day: Rock Band.'" [...] Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica called the game [...] "paint by numbers rocking", commenting that the feature set is essentially the same as The Beatles. Patrick Klepek of G4TV stated the game was [...] "not as ambitious as The Beatles" [...] but still came to help him appreciate the band more.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, {{the great}} Italian tenor, Enrico Caruso, {{performed}} at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester. The concert was attended by one William Grimshaw, a gramophone salesman from Prestwich {{and a few days}} later, he took his gramophone to Heaton Park and played recordings of the songs performed by Caruso to an assembled crowd of 40,000 people who, according to the Prestwich and Heaton Park Guardian, [...] "remained as if spellbound from the moment of arrival to the close of the programme, which, it is hardly necessary <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>was</b> intensely enjoyed." [...] Caruso later wrote to Mr. Grimshaw to thank him for the way his voice had been reproduced, sending him a signed cartoon of himself. Grimshaw was the first person in Britain to give gramophone concerts in the open, an idea which soon spread across the country. The concerts were carried on for several seasons and as they grew in popularity, Grimshaw became known across Lancashire as the [...] "Gramophone King" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1910, Wanamaker {{replaced}} his Grand Depot in stages, {{and constructed}} a new, purpose-built structure {{on the same}} site in Center City Philadelphia. [...] The new store, built in the Florentine style with granite walls by Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham, had 12 floors (9 for retail), numerous galleries and two lower levels totaling nearly two million square feet. The palatial emporium featured the Wanamaker Organ, the former St. Louis World's Fair pipe organ, at the time one of the world's largest organs. The organ was installed in the store's marble-clad central atrium known as the Grand Court. Another item from the St. Louis Fair in the Grand Court is the large bronze eagle, which quickly became {{the symbol of the}} store and a favorite meeting place for shoppers. [...] All one had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Meet You at The Eagle" [...] and everyone knew where to go. The store was dedicated by President William Howard Taft on December 13, 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Hansen {{later said}} {{this was the moment}} where he [...] "had" [...] him. Since all Hansen had to go on was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not have known for sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> 'I'm glad you asked, I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E

[...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently.
