500|$|Henderson {{served as}} an {{assistant}} to his former coach Carmody during Carmody's first eleven seasons as the coach at Northwestern University. Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those guys on the court. The thing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> is that he's faster than all of them." [...] During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament.|$|E

6000|$|... "Prayers, Chub," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "are more {{in our hearts}} than in our hands. It isn't what we do that counts; it's what we feel. But the most <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> is what the folks at home will think, when we don't come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|The doctor turned with a grim {{smile to}} his companion. [...] "That's {{the only thing}} <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me,</b> and I've been waiting for. She's settled it. She'll do. Come." ...|$|R
6000|$|I visited Lady J.S., {{and had the}} {{pleasure}} to find her well. I wrote a little, and got over a place <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> Cadell has apprehensions of A[nne] of G[eierstein], so have I. Well, {{the worst of it}} is, we must do something better.[311] ...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, Aames {{agreed to}} promote the film, because he {{admitted}} that [...] "aside from those parts <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> <b>me,</b> it's a damn good film." [...] Cates felt differently, and refused {{to have anything to}} do with the promotion such as screenings and parties. According to Aames, Cates was [...] "really upset" [...] by the film.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--it's that <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me.</b> If I {{had seen}} him do it I would have gone {{straight}} and told Dechamp, but I didn't quite see him, you see. I was in Lamartine's cart at the time, rummagin' about for a piece o' wood to make this very bow, an' the moment I heard the shot I peeped out, an' saw--nothing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can any one help it? Theoretically we are right--I am sure of it. If {{we leave}} it to the politicians, this war will go {{dragging}} on for God knows how long. It's the people who are paying. It's the people who ought to make the peace. The only thing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> is whether we are doing it the right way. Is Freistner honest? Could he be self-deceived? Is there any chance that he could be playing {{into the hands of the}} Pan-Germans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am of {{the belief}} {{that we have made}} what you might call a tunnel {{straight}} through, and within a dozen inches of the surface," [...] he replied. [...] "I had no means of guessing as to the distance, except by taking the flooring of the building as being well on the level, and from that I feel positive I had made my way upward to a point equal in height to the last rung of the ladder. The question <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> is, how we can break through the crust of earth without leaving behind token of what has been done?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so {{much the}} nipples <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> It was the codpiece. The press {{obviously}} played it up {{and made it a}} big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital!" [...] Sir Henry exclaimed. [...] "It isn't {{a letter}} <b>that's</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>me,</b> though, Mills. There {{are just a}} few {{geographical}} notes I want to make. You know, I'm trying to improve the fishermen's chart of the coast round here. That fellow Groocock--Jimmy Dumble's uncle--very nearly lost his motor boat last week through trusting to the old one." ...|$|R
2500|$|A puppet {{version of}} Garofalo {{appeared}} (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, {{she was more}} upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. [...] "I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America <b>bothered</b> <b>me,</b> the fact they didn't send <b>me</b> my puppet, <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> even more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's better--getting on finely. So {{far as my}} leg is concerned, I believe I {{shall be}} fit to go out again within ten days. It's my arm <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> a little. One of the nerves, the doctor said, must be wrong. I can only just lift it. You've no idea," [...] he went on, [...] "how a game leg and a trussed-up arm {{interfere}} with the little round of one's daily life. I can't ride, can't play golf or billiards, and for an unintelligent chap like me," [...] he {{wound up with a}} sigh, [...] "there aren't a great many other ways of passing the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got it, Billy," [...] says Silver. [...] "All emigrants have it. New York's {{bigger than}} Little Rock or Europe, and it frightens a foreigner. You'll be all right. I tell you I feel like {{slapping}} {{the people here}} because they don't send me all their money in laundry baskets, with germicide sprinkled over it. I hate to go down {{on the street to}} get it. Who wears the diamonds in this town? Why, Winnie, the Wiretapper's wife, and Bella, the Buncosteerer's bride. New Yorkers can be worked easier than a blue rose on a tidy. The only thing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> is I know I'll break the cigars in my vest pocket when I get my clothes all full of twenties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait till Sunday," [...] {{he said to}} Saxon. [...] "I'll {{give that}} poet a run for his money. Why, they ain't a place <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> now. I've got the head confidence. I run where I went on hands an' knees. I figured it out this way: Suppose you had a foot to fall on each side, an' it was soft hay. They'd be nothing to stop you. You wouldn't fall. You'd go like a streak. Then it's just the same if it's a mile down on each side. That ain't your concern. Your concern is {{to stay on top}} and go like a streak. An', d'ye know, Saxon, when I went at it that way it never bothered me at all. Wait till he comes with his crowd Sunday. I'm ready for him." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{talking with}} the New York client whose local {{interests}} I represented I sat thinking over the conversation with Perry. Considering Maude's intimacy with and affection for the Blackwoods, the affair was awkward, opening up many uncomfortable possibilities; {{and it was the}} prospect of discomfort <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> rather than regret for the probable loss of Perry's friendship. I still believed myself to have an affection for him: undoubtedly this was a sentimental remnant....|$|R
5000|$|A puppet {{version of}} Garofalo {{appeared}} (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie Team America: World Police; while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, {{she was more}} upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence.

2500|$|After a brief tour, John K {{decided to}} rejoin Biomechanical full-time. In an interview, John said [...] "I found my self giving Biomechanical less that [...] 100% and <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> a lot... As a {{musician}} {{you have something}} to say and I think you can easily lose direction by playing in two or three bands. I personally find it disorientating and I would prefer to focus in my band only." [...] The decision was amicable and the band continued to work on other projects.|$|R
6000|$|Gerald Burke {{was silent}} for some time. [...] "The scheme seems a {{possible}} one," [...] he said at last; [...] "it {{is the question of}} the priest <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me.</b> You know, both in Seville and Cadiz there are Irish colleges, and at both places there are several priests whom I knew before they entered the Church, and who would, I am sure, perform the service for me on any ordinary occasion; but it is a different thing asking them to take a share in such a business as this, for they would render themselves liable to all sorts of penalties and punishments from their superiors. However, the difficulty must be got over somehow, and at any rate the plan seems to promise better than anything I had thought of. The first difficulty is how to get the ruffians for such a business. I cannot go up to the first beetle browed knave I meet in the street and say to him, 'Are you disposed to aid me in the abduction of a lady?'" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had asked}} Jone and Mr. Poplington to go ahead, because I knew I {{could do a}} great deal better if I worked along by myself for a while, without being told what I ought {{to do and what}} I oughtn't to do. There is nothing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> so much as to have people try to teach me things when I am puzzling them out for myself. But now I found that {{although}} they could not be far ahead, I couldn't see them, on account of the twists in the road and the high hedges, and so I put on steam and went along at a fine rate, sniffing the breeze like a charger of the battlefield. Before very long I came to a place where the road forked, but the road to the left seemed like a lane leading to somebody's house, so I kept on in what was plainly the main road, which made a little turn where it forked. Looking out ahead of me, to see if I could catch sight of the two men, I could not see a sign of them, but I did see that I was {{on the top of a}} long hill that seemed to lead on and down and on and down, with no end to it.|$|E
5000|$|... “I’ve {{never had}} a problem {{speaking}} out about something <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me,</b> The biggest thing that rubs me the wrong way is that governing bodies want to control the space I feel I should control.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{gave his}} equine snort, {{as if the}} sense of his power could best vent itself so. [...] "Why can't she let <b>me</b> alone? <b>That</b> girl <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> worse {{than all the other}} women in Leatherwood put together. She won't let me let her alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Robin was an {{outgrowth}} of a conversation I had with Bob. As I said, Batman {{was a combination of}} Douglas Fairbanks and Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had his Watson. The thing <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> was <b>that</b> Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking. I found that as I went along Batman needed a Watson to talk to. That's how Robin came to be. Bob called me over and {{said he was going to}} put a boy in the strip to identify with Batman. I thought it was a great idea." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Sway Calloway, Eminem stated that, [...] "everything he wanted to address" [...] in regard to his mother is on [...] "Headlights" [...] and he likely will not speak on the topic outside of that particular song. He also told Zane Lowe that [...] "It {{was one of those}} things <b>that’s</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> for a little bit. It {{was one of those things}} that I needed to get off my chest. So I don’t really have anything to elaborate or expand on that record other than everything that I needed to say, I put on that record." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gamel-Medler said [...] "The part <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> {{the most}} is, I {{should be able}} to go {{anywhere}} in Oklahoma and live anywhere I want and live peacefully with my son," [...] he said. [...] "But I can’t. Not in Hitchcock." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the same}} second act that earned praise from some critics was criticised by Sam Marlowe, saying [...] "The {{problem is that}} this parade of comic {{cardboard}} cut-outs is impossible to care about, so it's not long before it falls flat," [...] whilst arguing the earlier scenes worked better. Charles Spencer, reviewing the show on its tour at Guildford, was harsher, suggesting this play was evidence of Ayckbourn's decline. He wrote: [...] "Ultimately, it's the laziness <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> most about latter-day Ayckbourn. You don't feel he truly cares about his characters any more: indeed, at times he can't be bothered to get inside their heads at all." ...|$|E
60|$|It did {{not seem}} to me that I was lost, yet lost I was. The peaks were not in sight. The canyon widened down the slope, and I was pretty sure that it opened out flat into the great pine forest of Penetier. The only thing <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> was the loss of my mustang and outfit; I could not {{reconcile}} myself to that. So I wandered about with a strange, full sense of freedom such as I had never before known. What was {{to be the end of}} my adventure I could not guess, and I wasted no time worrying over it.|$|R
50|$|He {{spoke for}} {{those who could not}} speak for themselves…His was the voice of the underdog, the {{conscience}} of youth, the power of conviction.And his was the voice that made me {{go out and buy a}} banjo and a Seeger instruction record. I practiced eight hours a day and it wasn’t long before I was good enough to accompany songs that lashed out at the things <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> Naturally these efforts took their toll on my grades.…Pete was building a barn then, and in return for my help with the construction he gave me banjo lessons. Without the Seegers I probably never would have made the grade as a performer.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I {{was going}} to ask you about, Dave. I don't want to have <b>that</b> fellow <b>bothering</b> <b>me.</b> I told you I {{was going to}} turn over a new leaf." [...] And now for once in his life, Nat Poole looked Dave and then Ben {{squarely}} in the face.|$|R
5000|$|I {{never knew}} what hate was until now. Even though I do hate her, I still love her at the same time. <b>That</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me,</b> it is so confusing. How can you hate someone and love {{them at the same}} time? I just wish that she would say sorry for {{everything}} she did, including all the lies. As horrible as it makes me feel, this is goodbye mom. As hard as you tried, I survived and I will survive because now I'm surrounded by people that love me. I'm going to do good things in this world despite making me {{in every sense of the}} word an orphan. Ashley Wallace ...|$|E
5000|$|Just shy of A Boy Named Goos release, Tutuska was {{formally}} {{fired from the}} band by Rzeznik, and replaced by Mike Malinin. Tutuska has been quoted as stating he has no resentment toward the bands ongoing success. In a 1999 interview, Tutuska commented that [...] "The only thing <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> {{to this very day}} is I never got my due as a songwriter ... if I could give people a list of songs I wrote, I think it would shock them... A lot of the songs that had gotten airplay Id written the lions share of, but I had taken my third and now Rzeznik wanted everything." [...] The Goo Goo Dolls had no comment on these allegations.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{deals with}} Neefs worries, which {{are caused by}} a love interest. The lyrics are often the subject of humour, as the chorus {{features}} the Dutch lines [...] "Oh oh, ik heb zorgen, oh oh, ik heb zorgen/Oh oh, ik heb zorgen en dat verveelt me zo", with the phrase [...] "en dat verveelt me zo" [...] being variously translated as [...] "And that worries me a lot" [...] and [...] "And <b>that</b> <b>bothers</b> <b>me</b> a lot", both of which sound odd in English. Des Mangan in fact translates the lyric as [...] "And that bores me a lot", which further adds to the surreal effect. Neefs also recorded the song in English (as [...] "I Got Troubles") and German ("Ich habe Sorgen").|$|E
2500|$|Producer Robert Lorenz {{said that}} while the script was {{originally}} set in Minnesota, he chose Michigan as the actual setting as Kowalski is a retired car plant worker. Metro Detroit was the point of origin of the Ford Motor Company. Schenk said that sometimes the lines in the movie feel out of place with the Detroit setting; for instance a line about one of Walt's sons asks if Walt still knows a person who has season tickets for Minnesota Vikings games was changed to being about a person with Detroit Lions tickets. Schenk said [...] "They don't sell out in Detroit. And so <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> It seemed really untrue to me." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{found your}} letter, which was printed in issue five of >i>Novyi mir>/i>, quite perplexing. And I {{am not the}} only one. Many of my acquaintances ask me: "Did you read it? What is it all about?" I was not {{immediately}} able to say just {{what it was in}} your letter <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> After all, you did not provide material for scholarly discussion by economists. Nor did you cite facts or arguments. The only thing that could be considered an argument was your brief statement about the failure of the social democratic, "third road" in capitalist countries. But is there anything new and surprising in this? Has any Soviet economist predicted that it would be successful? And what relationship does all this have to a socialist economy?...|$|R
5000|$|Robin was {{introduced}} as Batman's sidekick in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940). When Kane wanted Robin's origin to parallel Batman's, Finger made Robin's parents circus performers murdered while performing their trapeze act. Finger recalled: Robin was {{an outgrowth of}} a conversation I had with Bob. As I said, Batman {{was a combination of}} Douglas Fairbanks and Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had his Watson. The thing <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> was <b>that</b> Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking.
