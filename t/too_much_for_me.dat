500|$|In 1967, Shankar {{performed}} a well-received {{set at the}} Monterey Pop Festival. While complimentary of the talents {{of several of the}} rock artists at the festival, he said he was [...] "horrified" [...] to see Jimi Hendrix set fire to his guitar on stage: [...] "That was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> In our culture, we have such respect for musical instruments, they are like part of God." [...] Shankar's [...] peaked at number 43 on Billboards pop LPs chart in the US, which remains the highest placing he achieved on that chart.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck's [...] "sustained, understated" [...] performance, and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell's vessel [...] "a clever development," [...] especially praising actress Anna Torv's imitation of Nimoy's voice rather than [...] "doing the obvious thing and hav her lip-synch Nimoy reading the lines." [...] The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that unlike Tucker, he thought the idea of [...] "soul magnets" [...] was [...] "just so goofy that it's almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to handle". VanDerWerff also felt there wasn't much of {{a connection between the}} episode and the ongoing storyline [...] "until the show tries to force one in a way that doesn't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel". He did however praise Ruck as [...] "well-cast," [...] and wrote the episode [...] "very nearly managed" [...] to parallel Walter's [...] "desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science," [...] which the reviewer considers the strongest asset of the show.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{commercial}} and critical failure of the film, Carpenter became very disillusioned with Hollywood and became an independent filmmaker. He said in an interview, [...] "The experience [...] was the reason I stopped making movies for the Hollywood studios. I won't work for them again. I think Big Trouble is a wonderful film, and I'm very proud of it. But the reception it received, {{and the reasons for}} that reception, were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to deal with. I'm too old for that sort of bullshit." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think not," [...] he decided. [...] "The girl is {{impulsive}} and {{at times}} reckless, and doubtless {{she would like to}} be free from her father's guardianship; but I am sure she is too fond of you, and has <b>too</b> <b>much</b> respect <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> to run away from us without a word. Besides, she has no money." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 3-out-of-5 mixed review, Joey Magidson of {{the website}} Awards Circuit {{wrote that he}} [...] "appreciate(s) the {{directing}} skills on display in The Raid 2, but at a certain point, all of the fighting and killing nearly got to be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I’m recommending the film, {{but not in the}} same way as the last one." [...] He added that while it is [...] "creative enough to be worth a recommendation, it lacks the originality of the first flick" [...] and concluded that [...] "The Raid 2 will delight genre fans, but might not impress to many others." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{the mystery}} of the village green also offers an eternity that belittles {{problems}} such as public embarrassment ("All of My Friends Were There"), because [...] "When I feel that the world is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me". Elsewhere, he is [...] "Spreading my arms to the open wide. Now I am free... I can close my eyes", and [...] "the sky is wide" [...] – of which last Davies has said; [...] "to me, the whole record is the way I sing that line.".|$|E

It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> The 'Third World' is a term I don't like very much, because we're all one world. I {{want people to know}} that the largest part of humanity is suffering." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucy's {{little hand}} {{was on my}} arm, and she had drawn its glove {{on account of the}} heat.

2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've never been one to say the pressure was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E

60|$|MRS. DUDGEON. Timothy never {{acknowledged}} him as {{his brother}} after we were married: he had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> respect <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to insult me with such a brother.

60|$|I {{had nothing}} to do but to acquiesce, and make {{profession}} to him of my having no end in it, but a sincere desire to serve him.

6000|$|He wills the wardenry of his affairs [...] To his {{old friend}} the Bishop.
