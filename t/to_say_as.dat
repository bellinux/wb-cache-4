25|$|Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on 8 February 1942, shortly after a meeting with Hitler in East Prussia. Todt had become {{convinced}} that the war on the eastern front could not be won and thought himself independent enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> much to Hitler. As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a covert assassination, but this has never been substantiated.|$|E

The full scores for Die Walküre and Siegfried (Acts I and II) are in pencil; those for Das Rheingold (Prelude), Siegfried (Act III) and the whole of Götterdämmerung are in ink. Needless <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> many staves are used as are required by the instrumentation. No full score was made for Das Rheingold (Scenes 1-4), as the instrumentation draft was considered sufficiently detailed for a fair copy to be made directly from it.|$|E

The executions were also [...] "incalculable" [...] in their influence on the [...] "political awakening" [...] of Charles Stewart Parnell.

500|$|Salamis was {{the turning}} point in the second Persian invasion, and indeed the Greco-Persian Wars in general. While the battle did not end the Persian invasion, it {{effectively}} ensured that all Greece would not be conquered, and allowed the Allies to go on the offensive in 479BC. A number of historians believe that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history. Since Themistocles' long-standing advocacy of Athenian naval power enabled the Allied fleet to fight, and his stratagem brought about the Battle of Salamis, it is probably not an exaggeration <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> Plutarch does, that Themistocles, [...] "...is thought to have been the man most instrumental in achieving the salvation of Hellas." ...|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then {{they need to go}} out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E

She calls the sword [...] "Excalibur, that is as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> Cut-steel." [...] In the Vulgate Mort Artu, Arthur orders Griflet to throw the sword into the enchanted lake; after two failed attempts (as he felt such a great sword should not be thrown away), Griflet finally complies with the wounded king's request and a hand emerges from the lake to catch it. This tale becomes attached to Bedivere instead of Griflet in Malory and the English tradition. Malory records both versions of the legend in his Le Morte d'Arthur, naming both swords as Excalibur.|$|E

After the race, Bob Pockrass, a reporter with the Sporting News, asked Busch if being on probation made an impact during the Nationwide Series race. Busch replied [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} you right now because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's improper <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> well." [...] On June 4, NASCAR suspended Busch for both the upcoming tire test and the Pocono 400 at Pocono Raceway, and extended his probation though December 31, 2012.

2500|$|An earlier 1963 {{study by}} the poet James Radcliffe Squires spoke to the {{distinction}} of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of testing Genie's voice was still {{extremely}} high-pitched and soft, which linguists believed accounted for some of her abnormal expressive language, and the scientists {{worked very hard to}} improve it. Her voice gradually became moderately lower and louder, although it remained unusually high and soft, and she began to better articulate words. Despite this she consistently deleted or substituted sounds, making her extremely difficult to understand. The scientists believed Genie was often unaware of her pronunciation, but on other occasions she produced haplologies which were clearly intentional and would only speak more clearly if firmly, explicitly requested to; Curtiss attributed the latter to Genie trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> little as possible and still be understood. Eventually Curtiss and Marilyn convinced Genie to stop attempting her most extreme haplologies, but she continued to delete sounds when possible, causing linguists following the case to refer to Genie as [...] "the Great Abbreviator".|$|E

While stating that he would have preferred that the player stayed, he said that the club had to respect McManaman's decision to exercise his right to leave at the end of his contract. Houllier said, [...] "It wasn't unexpected. Steve had always maintained that he wanted to move abroad and I have to respect that... Emotionally we will miss him because he's a Liverpool lad, and needless <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> a player you can't fault him because he has immense ability...
