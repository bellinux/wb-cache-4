5|$|Initial {{estimates}} concerning Kepler-9c's mass were refined by follow-up observations {{made by the}} Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Keck {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were planets that were slightly smaller than planet Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Where {{there is}} still a corneal reflex or {{spontaneous}} motor response to painful stimulus but all other criteria are satisfied, or where any of the criteria cannot be performed but the remaining criteria are satisfied, the irreversible cessation of all brain functions can be determined by a combination of the criteria that have been satisfied and the performance of a supplementary test. These tests are cerebral angiography <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> there is no intracranial blood flow, and a radionuclide scan <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> there is no intracranial perfusion.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the group 10 elements, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> it behaves as the heavier homologue to platinum in group 10 as the eighth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Darmstadtium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{spectral}} {{data collected by}} HIRES and FIES, the Kepler team derived {{the characteristics of the}} host star. The HIRES and FIES results agreed on every aspect of the star that had been derived except for the star's radial velocity. With the stellar parameters known, the Kepler team interpreted the Spitzer data <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> Kepler-14b was indeed a planet.|$|E
5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun. Absalom demands Doggett show {{the back of his}} neck <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> Doggett is still himself. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for what he knew about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's {{information}} with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database; Absalom claims that the census bureau had data which showed the aliens were already here. Unfortunately, the plan fails because of an X-ray scanner detecting the gun. Security shoots Absalom through the head despite his use of Doggett as a body shield.|$|E

5|$|Calgacus' fate {{is unknown}} but, {{according}} to Tacitus, {{after the battle}} Agricola ordered the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> Britain was an island and to receive the surrender of the Orcadians. It was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain. However, the Roman historian Cassius Dio reports that this circumnavigation resulted in Titus receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79. This is five years before Mons Graupius is believed by most historians to have taken place.|$|E
5|$|Edward Seymour {{fell from}} power in 1549, {{and after his}} removal a new survey {{was carried out by}} Captain William Tyrell, in part <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> the new fortifications were {{suitably}} located across the islands. Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552.|$|E

5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element.

Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, copper, silver, and gold, although it may show some differences from them.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4 {{is named}} for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA {{telescope}} tasked with finding Earth-like planets that transit their stars as seen from Earth. As the previous three planets that Kepler confirmed had already been confirmed by other finds, Kepler-4 and its planet {{were the first to}} be discovered by the Kepler team. The star and its system were announced in Washington, D.C. at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010, along with Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. Of the presented planets, Kepler-4b was the smallest, around the size of planet Neptune. The discovery of Kepler-4b and the other planets presented at the AAS meeting helped <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> the Kepler spacecraft was indeed functional.|$|E

Combat, asymmetric warfare, violent insurgency and the constant threat of improvised explosive devices all contribute to the psychological stressors experienced by Canadian soldiers. Mental health teams deployed with the soldiers and provided assessment, treatment and education. Lessons learned included refuting the myth that all psychological disorders would be related <b>to</b> trauma; <b>confirming</b> <b>that</b> most patients do well after exposure <b>to</b> trauma; <b>confirming</b> <b>that</b> treating disorders {{in a war zone}} requires flexible and creative adaptation of civilian treatment guidelines; and <b>confirming</b> <b>that</b> in a combat mission mental health practice {{is not limited to the}} clinical setting...|$|R

5|$|Sarwar became interim leader {{following}} Lamont's resignation, {{and announced}} plans for the party to hold a leadership contest, with the winner to be announced on 13 December. Sarah Boyack became the first person <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> she would be standing {{as a candidate for}} party leader; she was subsequently joined by Neil Findlay and Jim Murphy. Katy Clark and Kezia Dugdale entered the deputy leadership race. Findlay was among those to call on former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to enter the contest, but he ruled out doing so. Other senior Labour figures who decided not to put their names forward included Sarwar, Jackie Baillie, and Jenny Marra.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using {{smaller and more}} agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were {{that there was not}} enough damage below the waterline <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to shatter the torpedo bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, which seem <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> the 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In {{his efforts to}} build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had {{hit him in the}} chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; a clip of film from the Oval match appeared <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E
