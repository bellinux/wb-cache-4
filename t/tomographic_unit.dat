40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} a primary {{colorectal}} cancer screening with computerized tomographic colonography on current radiological capacity is unknown. The multispecialty needs for computerized tomographic examinations raise some doubts on the feasibility of a mass colorectal cancer screening with computerized tomographic colonography. Aim: To assess {{whether the number of}} available computerized <b>tomographic</b> <b>units</b> in Europe is adequate to cover population screening with computerized tomographic colonography. Methods: A mathematical and a Markov model were, respectively, used to assess the number of computerized tomographic colonography procedures needed to be performed each day in the start-up and in the steady-state phases of a colorectal cancer screening programme in Europe. Such outcome was divided for the total number of computerized tomographic machines aged < 10 years estimated to be present in the European hospitals. Results: At a simulated 30 % compliance, 28 760 130 European people would need to be screened by the 3482 available computerized <b>tomographic</b> <b>units</b> in a 5 -year start-up period, corresponding to 6. 6 CTC/CT unit/day. Assuming a 10 -year repetition of computerized tomographic colonography between 50 and 80 years, the number of computerized tomographic colonography needed to be performed in the steady-state period appeared to be 4. 3 /CT unit/day. Conclusions: The current radiological capacity may cover the need for a primary colorectal cancer screening with computerized tomographic colonography in a steady state. On the other hand, a substantial implementation of the current computerized tomographic capacity or a synergistic approach with other techniques seems to be necessary for the start-up period. © 2008 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined A new phantom {{has been}} {{designed}} that can provide simultaneously different target to background activity ratios with a linearly changing diameter of lesions. The {{purpose of the study}} was to describe and perform initial measurements with the phantom aimed to characterize different nuclear medicine tomographic systems and reconstruction algorithms in their performance and behaviour concerning partial volume effect (PVE) and detectability by varying the acquisition parameters and the count statistics. The phantom has an external vessel whose outline is half-cylindrical and allows it to be incorporated into an anthropomorphic thorax phantom. The phantom itself contains 16 fillable cones with an inner diameter linearly decreasing from 16 mm to 2 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm acrylic glass. They as well as the outer vessel were separately filled with (99 m) Tc-and (18) F-solutions respectively of different activity concentrations. The phantom was easy to fill and air bubbles could easily be avoided. Images taken using a SPECT/CT and a PET/CT system are presented as well as evaluations of PVE. The new phantom seems to be useful for comparison and optimisation of different acquisition and reconstruction parameters in nuclear medicine tomographic studies and for comparisons between various <b>tomographic</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstrac t:- The {{conventional}} {{tools and}} methodologies used until now to investigate soil parameters {{have been of}} limited use due to either their invasive nature or low resolution. Accurate knowledge of phenomena occurring in soils, mainly those occurring in non-saturated zone, would lead to better planning of agricultural, activities. Conventional tools and methodologies include neutron probes gravimetry, d X an γ ray transmission, tracers, and mercury intrusion. Understanding of most of these phenomena depends on investigation at the pore and aggregate levels. To improve conventional tools and methodologies for soil investigation, y an X-ra microtomography t scanner was built a Embrapa Agriculture Instrumentation to generate non-destructive images of soil samples, with at least 100 µm spatial resolution. It is low cost equipment, compared to commercially available CT scanners designed principally for medical and industrial use, which are very expensive and consequently not always accessible for use in soil studies. A CT image of glass beads with diameters ranging from 297 µ m to 0 50 µ m and pores with 100 µm size or less is n presented. A CT image of a red w yello Latosol soil sample is presented. a Details like macropore with 240 µm diameter, a fracture with 160 µm wide, and some mineral particles measuring 240 µ m or. less can be observed An application of the equipment to investigate seed mechanical injury is shown. In this image an 80 µm fracture inside a corn seed can be observed.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a small animal PET scanner consisting of two block detectors, each made of 216 BGO crystals of dimensions 3. 75 mm x 3. 75 mm x 20 mm, cylindrically arranged and coupled to a position-sensitive photomultiplier tube (82486 PSPMT). Our design {{was based on a}} very detailed Monte Carlo, that simulates the function of a PET scanner from the system level down to the individual gamma-ray detectors. We have made laboratory measurements of the individual detector performance as well as measurements of characteristics of the PSPMTs. The two detector blocks which will form the basic <b>tomographic</b> <b>unit</b> have been assembled. We {{are developing}} electronics to individually process (amplify and digitize) anode signals, and use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in the position determination and energy measurement of the gamma-rays.

40|$|Compaction {{processes}} {{can influence}} soil physical properties such as soil density, porosity, pore size distribu-tion, and processes like soil water and nutrient movements, root system distribution, and others. Soil porosity modification has important consequences like alterations in results of soil water retention curves. These alter-ations may cause differences in soil water storage calculations and matric potential values, which are utilized in irrigation management systems. Because of this, soil-sampling techniques should avoid alterations of sample structure. In this work soil sample compaction caused by core sampling devices was investigated using the gamma ray computed tomography technique. A first generation tomograph with fixed source-detector arrange-ment and translation/rotational {{movements of the}} sample was utilized to obtain the images. The radioactive source is 241 Am, with an activity of 3. 7 GBq, and the detector consists of a 3 in. x 3 in. NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal coupled to a photomultiplier tube. Soil samples were taken from an experimental field utilizing cylinders 4. 0 cm high and 2. 6 cm in diameter. Based on image analyses it was possible to detect compacted regions in all samples next to the cylinder wall due to the sampling system. <b>Tomographic</b> <b>unit</b> profiles of the sample permitted to identify higher values of soil density for deeper regions of the sample, and it was possible to determine the average densities and thickness of these layers. Tomographic analyses showed to be a very useful tool for soil compaction characterization and presented many advantages in relation to traditional methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{changes in}} diagnosis {{and management of}} TMD patients after radiographic examination and to evaluate the associations between specific TMJ tomographic findings and changes in management. Methods: 204 adult patients (48 males, 156 females, mean age 40 years) with TMJ pain/sounds or problems with mandibular motion were examined according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) by one of six calibrated orofacial pain specialists. Diagnoses and management strategy reached {{without the aid of}} radiographs were recorded. It was possible to select from seven management categories (pharmacology, physiotherapy, psychological, occlusal stabilization, surgical, other examinations and referrals) each with a number of sub-categories. Bilateral sagittal corrected TMJ tomograms in closed position were obtained using conventional film in a Cranex Tome or a Scanora <b>tomographic</b> X-ray <b>unit.</b> The tomograms were assessed for the presence of flattening, erosion, osteophyte and sclerosis in the TMJ components and the condyle-to-mandibular fossa relation by one of five calibrated oral radiologists blinded to the clinical diagnosis and initial management strategy. After gaining access to the results from the radiographic examination the orofacial pain specialists re-evaluated their diagnoses and management strategy. All changes were calculated. Logistic regression analyses (with odds ratio (OR) and significance level (p)) were performed with changes in management as the dependent variable and with age and radiographic findings as the independent variables. Results: 41 % of the clinical arthralgia diagnoses were changed into osteoarthritis after radiographic examination and the number of osteoarthrosis diagnoses increased with 200 % (from 13 to 39). One or more changes in the management strategy were found for 27 % (55) of the patients. Most often changes occurred in pharmacology and physiotherapy (29 and 28 patients respectively) followed by changes in psychological (13 patients), occlusal stabilization (8 patients), referrals (7 patients), other examinations (6 patients) and surgical (2 patients). For pharmacology, physiotherapy and psychological the changes were adjustments within the sub-categories in 51 out of 70 patients. For the other management categories most of the changes were addition or omission of the management category (in 20 out of 23 patients). The chance of “any change” in management (removal or addition of one or more sub-categories in one or more management categories) was more than twice as high with a finding of flattening (OR= 2. 28) and erosion (OR= 2. 03) compared to not having these radiographic findings. Increased chance of “any change” in management was also found with > 1 radiographic finding (regardless of type) (OR= 2. 64) compared to having no radiographic findings. The chance of change in pharmacology was increased more than three times with erosion (OR= 3. 60) and more than two times with flattening (OR= 2. 56). The chance of change in physiotherapy was increased with > 1 radiographic finding (OR= 2. 79). No statistically significant (p≤ 0. 05) associations between osteophyte, sclerosis and age and changes in management were found. Conclusion: 27 % of the patients had changes in management after radiographic examination. Radiographic findings did increase the chance of changes in management. However, as the changes were mostly adjustments in sub-categories radiography may have a minor impact on management of most TMD patients...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{assessment}} of advanced materials like high strength ceramics and fibre reinforced composites requires (e. g. {{because of the}} brittleness of ceramics) detection and characterization of early damage and defects as, for examples, cracks and pores even with linear dimensions of only 10 mym. Structures {{of the same size}} must be distinguishable in components of precision mechanics and electronics. This paper discusses microfocal X-ray radiography and high resolution computed tomography. The latter can be looked at as a nondestructive microscopic technique imaging cross sections of an object. Results of investigations using a <b>tomographic</b> <b>unit</b> with a resolution capability of the order of magnitude of 20 mym are presented. The development of high strength ceramics and the application of these materials in machine building demands the detection and characterization of very small defects. Since these materials are very brittle the crack is the most critical kind of defect. From a fracture me chanics point of view, the limit of detection lies significantly below 50 mym for crack-like defects (1). Fibre reinforced composites require a similar detection capability. Their strength and reliability depend on orientation and fibre-resin distribution {{as well as on the}} size and concentration of the included pores. Porosity can lead to a lack of bonding between fibre and matrix and consequently to delaminations. Furthermore, microstructural electronic components need a careful nondestructive inspection. Problems are delamination of glued parts, orientation of layers, and soldering joints. The detection and size determination of such small defects requires the application of advanced NDT-methods. Especially in complex shaped parts, the investigation can be carried out by microfocal X-ray radiography without the enormous scanning mechanism necessary for other high resolution methods like ultrasonics. High resolution radiography is achieved by microfocal X-ray tubes. In radiography, a l l the details of a three dimensional object are projected to a two-dimensional plane. Complete size determination and orientation of defects and microstructures can only be found by multiangle radiation, finally leading to X-ray computed tomography. This technique enables imaging of single planes within an object and therefore gives information about the 3 dimensional distribution and location of defects in the object. The micro tomography can be looked at as a nondestructive microscopic technique imaging cross section of an object without the necessity of cutting out slices. This paper describes the equipment for microradiography and micro computed tomography and dicusses their application for NDT of some advanced mat...|$|E
