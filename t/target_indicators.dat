5|$|At 18:00 {{the first}} {{aircraft}} began to take-off. The first RAF aircraft over Germany were medium bomber variants of the de Havilland Mosquito. No. 8 Group RAF committed 89 to bomb Berlin and Würzburg. The Mosquitos marked {{the area with}} <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> while 64 others dropped 59 tons of bombs. Six Mosquitos marked Würzburg which was then while 24 others each dropped a Blockbuster bomb in a concentrated area east of the river causing a large fire.

25|$|JG 300 had {{its origins}} in April 1943, when Major Hajo Herrmann, a {{decorated}} bomber pilot, advocated the use of single-seat day fighters as night fighters against the Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber offensive.

These operations were tested over Berlin during May and June 1943 and codenamed Wilde Sau.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} the British {{aircraft}} took off at around 17:20 hours CET for the [...] journey. This {{was a group of}} Lancasters from Bomber Command's 83 Squadron, No. 5 Group, acting as the Pathfinders, or flare force, whose job it was to find Dresden and drop magnesium parachute flares, known to the Germans as [...] "Christmas trees", to light up the area for the bombers. The next set of aircraft to leave England were twin-engined Mosquito marker planes, which would identify target areas and drop 1,000-pound <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> (TIs)" [...] that created a red glow for the bombers to aim at. The attack was to centre on the Ostragehege sports stadium, next to the city's medieval Altstadt (old town), with its congested and highly combustible timbered buildings.|$|E

2500|$|The sirens started {{sounding}} in Dresden at 21:51 (CET). Wing Commander Maurice Smith, {{flying in}} a Mosquito, {{gave the order}} to the Lancasters: [...] "Controller to Plate Rack Force: Come in and bomb glow of red <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> as planned. Bomb the glow of red TIs as planned." [...] The first bombs were released at 22:14, the Lancasters flying in at , with all but one Lancaster's bombs released within two minutes, {{and the last one}} releasing at 22:22. The fan-shaped area that was bombed was [...] long, and at its extreme about [...] wide. The shape and total devastation of the area was created by the bombers of No. 5 Group flying over the head of the fan (Ostragehege stadium) on prearranged compass bearings and releasing their bombs at different prearranged times.|$|E
50|$|<b>Target</b> <b>Indicators</b> were {{available}} in various colours, and during a raid bomb aimers would be instructed by the Master Bomber to drop their bombs on the <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> of a specified colour, marker aircraft carrying different colours should the initial <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> be dropped off target. The first <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> could be cancelled over the radio by the Master Bomber and the Marker crews instructed to drop new <b>target</b> <b>indicators</b> of a different colour, until the correct aiming point was correctly marked. The Main Force bombers would then be instructed by the Master Bomber to bomb the colour of the most accurate <b>target</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Target</b> <b>Indicators,</b> {{also known}} as target markers or TI's for short, were flares used by the RAF's Bomber Command during World War II.

After their introduction, the use of TI's expanded to include en-route markers to gather up lost aircraft, additional drops of TI's to keep the target lit over long periods, and various changes in technique to address German defences.|$|E
