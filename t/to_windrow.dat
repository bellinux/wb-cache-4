40|$|Background, Aims and Scope. Harvest {{residues}} {{were formed}} into <b>windrows</b> <b>to</b> prevent nitrogen (N) losses through volatilisation and erosion that occurred following pile and burn operations in hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn.) plantations of subtropical Australia. We selected second rotation (2 R) hoop pine sites where the windrows (10 - 15 m apart) had been formed 1, 2 and 3 {{years prior to}} sampling {{in order to examine}} soil carbon (C) and N in the areas beneath and between the windrows. Methods. We used conventional chemical methods, anaerobic incubation assay, 13 C and 15 N natural abundance analyses and, solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results. Percent mineralisable N (PCMN) was the only parameter in the underneath windrow position at the Year 1 site that did not show a significant difference {{to the rest of the}} positions along the transect. However, positions adjacent <b>to</b> <b>windrows</b> did have significantly greater PCMN at the Year 1 site than other positions along the transect. PCMN, total N and total C were significantly greater underneath the windrows at the Year 3 site, whilst d 13 C was significantly more negative in the underneath windrow positions. Discussion. PCMN was the most sensitive biological indicator of the changes occurring in the soil due to decomposition of the windrows, with the beneath-windrow position having a significantly higher PCMN than the inter-windrow position (p< 0. 001) at the Year 3 site. Isotopic natural abundance for both 13 C and 15 N was able to detect the influx of labile materials from new residues. Solid-state 13 C NMR was able to detect inputs of labile C from the windrows at the Year 1 site, whilst the increase in aromatic C at the Year 3 site was indicative of the more advanced stages of windrow decomposition. Conclusions. Decomposition of windrowed residues had a beneficial effect on soil N and C pools. However, the effect remained localised after 3 years, indicating that trees needed to be planted close <b>to</b> the <b>windrows</b> <b>to</b> gain any benefit from residue decomposition. Recommendations and Perspectives. The use of windrows allows a clear planting area and provides a good barrier against soil erosion. However, trees can only gain access to the nutrients from the decomposing residues if they are planted close <b>to</b> the <b>windrows.</b> Limiting the width of the cleared areas to allow for only 2 planting rows will give the maximum benefit to the developing trees.

40|$|The {{biological}} stabilisation of {{the organic}} fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) into a form stable enough for land application can be achieved via aerobic or anaerobic treatments. To investigate the rates of degradation (e. g. via electron equivalents removed, or via carbon emitted) of aerobic and anaerobic treatment, OFMSW samples were exposed to computer controlled laboratory-scale aerobic (static in-vessel composting), and anaerobic (thermophilic anaerobic digestion with liquor recycle) treatment individually and in combination. A comparison of the degradation rates, based on electron flow revealed that provided a suitable inoculum was used, anaerobic digestion was the faster of the two waste conversion process. In addition to faster maximum substrate oxidation rates, anaerobic digestion (followed by post-treatment aerobic maturation), when compared to static composting alone, converted a larger fraction {{of the organic}}s to gaseous end-products (CO 2 and CH 4), leading to improved end-product stability and maturity, as measured by compost self-heating and root elongation tests, respectively. While not comparable <b>to</b> <b>windrow</b> and other mixed, highly aerated compost systems, our results show that in the thermophilic, in-vessel treatment investigated here, {{the inclusion of a}} anaerobic phase, rather than using composting alone, improved hydrolysis rates as well as oxidation rates and product stability.

40|$|Wood fuels make a key {{contribution}} to {{renewable energy sources}} in the Nordic countries. The growing demand for forest biomass can be partly met by utilising energy-rich stumps left after clear cutting. As fuel, stump wood is commonly associated with a high presence of contaminants, resulting in high ash content. The concentration of contaminants depends on factors such as soil type, weather conditions, harvesting method, storage duration and other handling operations. The high ash content is a major drawback when using stump wood as fuel. Handling methods that could improve fuel quality are therefore highly desirable. To produce a fuel of acceptable quality, i. e. with low moisture and ash content and high energy value, the above-mentioned factors require evaluation and quantification. In this thesis, various handling methods within the supply chain for Norway spruce stump and their effects on the biomass as fuel are evaluated. The following handling processes are dealt with: harvesting technique, pre-treatments including stump splitting/fractionation and cleaning using vibration or sieving, storage methods and storage duration. Choice of stump harvesting head proved {{to have an impact}} on fuel quality, as splitting of stumps during extraction allowed better drying during storage. Such stumps could be stored directly in windrows, since no difference could be established between this method and storage in heaps prior <b>to</b> <b>windrow</b> storage. In general, storage improved fuel quality. Changes in fuel quality parameters do not reflect the whole picture, however, since dry matter losses occur during storage, and therefore the storage period should be kept as short as possible. During winter months, when demands for fuel are highest, stump ash content can be high, since frozen contaminants are difficult to detach from stumps during transport. To achieve acceptable fuel quality during high demand periods, long storage duration or a pre-treatment involving additional stump cleaning is required. Fuel quality was clearly improved by vibration-based cleaning before the comminution of stumps or by sieving stump wood after crushing. These methods can allow stump wood fuel of acceptable quality to be supplied within a harvesting season...|$|E
40|$|The Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine (RDKS), {{located in}} {{northwest}} British Columbia, has embraced {{the goals of}} Zero Waste {{and would like to}} adopt a zero organics strategy for its' landfills. The 2009 Waste Composition Study determined that 2002 tonnes of organic material is being delivered to the landfills in the Terrace Area. If this organic material were to be composted the cost <b>to</b> <b>windrow</b> compost wood and yard/garden waste would be $ 88. 46 /tonne or $ 44. 23 /m³. If food waste is incorporated into the feedstock costs would increase to $ 127. 19 /tonne or $ 91. 05 /m³, utilizing aerated bins and windrow composting. From a strictly financial perspective the costs of composting outweigh the benefits. It was determined that purchasing compost {{to be used as a}} final cover at the Thornhill Landfill from a supplier is more cost effective than producing compost from a RDKS composting facility. A diversion of organics from the Thornhill Landfill has no material effect on the post closure leachate treatment costs or on the extension of the useful life of that landfill. The benefits of diverting organics from the Forceman Ridge Landfill on the leachate treatment facility could not be monetarily quantified as that landfill is still in the design stages. The capacity of the Forceman Ridge landfill is 50 + years. An organic diversion policy will extend the useful life of that landfill but assigning a monetary value to a benefit that will be accrued 50 + years in the future was not done due to the inherent inaccuracies in predicting something so distant in the future. In anticipation of a zero organics strategy the RDKS should consider promoting backyard or decentralized composting and implement a pilot project of composting wood and yard/garden waste and a pilot project incorporating food waste. Unless the pilot project indicates otherwise any future composting facility should be established at the Thornhill Landfill due to the inherent transportation cost savings. [...] P. ii-iii.

40|$|Biodegradable {{organic waste}} {{including}} food waste {{is the largest}} kind of municipal solid waste produced in the UK each year. Although there is enormous annual variation in the composition and characteristics depending on the source of waste produced, the portion of biodegradable organic waste including food waste is relatively high in the UK’s waste stream. The vast majority of these food wastes {{end up in a}} landfill without any recycling. It was found that a major portion of the UK’s total greenhouse gas (GHGs) emission is sourced in the food supply chain. As part of the targets set in Climate Change Act, 2008 the UK’s HEIs need {{to play a role in}} meeting national goals for GHGs emission reduction. The EU Landfill Directive also has a target set for the reduction of biodegradable waste that is landfilled. The reduction of GHGs emissions in the UK’s higher education sector for all carbon emission sectors including the waste management is a necessity rather than a choice. This because government capital allocations for universities are linked to their carbon reduction capability. Because of associated problems with landfilling and increasing public concerns about degradation of environmental quality, recycling of organic waste including food waste to produce bioenergy, fertilizers through composting and/or anaerobic digestion (AD) are becoming more economically viable and are seen as an environment-friendly approach to the challenge of food waste management. The objective of the study was to estimate the amounts and types of food waste generated at Liverpool Hope University, Hope Park campus (UK) and to explore its on-site recycling potential through composting and/or anaerobic digestion. The study was conducted between December 2012 and August 2013. It involved a survey of food waste produced on the Hope Park campus, an assessment of the nature and types of the food waste produced, and a site audit together with a compositional analysis of the mixed food waste. It is estimated that the average annual food waste production at the Hope Park campus, Liverpool Hope University is 89. 07 metric tons. Among the types of food waste, vegetables and fruit items were the greatest by weight. Condiments, sauces, herbs, and spices items were found less frequently occurring and also less wasted by weight. Whereas bread, rice, pasta, and bakery products were the most frequently occurring food waste in comparison to meat, fish and dairy. The study concluded that composting was the most suitable option as a method of on-site food waste recycling rather than anaerobic digestion (AD). It was, however, dependent on the amount and nature of the food waste produced. The cost of in-vessel composting in the UK is relatively high in comparison <b>to</b> <b>windrow</b> or open composting. However, it is more favorable because of the efficient control of odor. The composition and types of food waste produced also suggest on-site composting over AD because of the volume of vegetables, fruit and bakery products within the waste stream making it more suitable for composting. However, AD is a preferable option for biodegradable organic waste management from an environmental perspective because of the benefit of carbon savings, but its establishment and operation need expert personnel and there is a higher setup cost. It was estimated that 44. 525 metric tons of carbon emission (CO 2 e) per year could saved by diverting food waste from landfill to on-site recycling through AD and/or composting. Total potential cost savings from diverting waste away from landfill to composting or AD was found to be £ 997. 55 per year at 2013 prices...|$|E

In order to investigate the effect of changes in residue management practices on soil properties in hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A.

Harvest residues were formed into <b>windrows</b> <b>to</b> prevent nitrogen (N) losses through volatilisation and erosion that had previously occurred as a result of pile and burn operations. We selected second rotation (2 R) hoop pine sites where the windrows (10 { 15 m apart) had been formed 1, 2 and 3 years prior to sampling in order to examine the spatial variability in soil carbon (C) and N and in potential mineralisable N (PMN) in the areas beneath and between (inter-) the windrows. We examined the implications of soil variability on the number of samples required to detect differences in means for specific soil properties, at different ages and at specified levels of accuracy. Sample size needed to accurately reflect differences between means was not affected by the position where the samples were taken relative <b>to</b> the <b>windrows</b> but differed according to the parameter to be sampled. The relative soil sampling size required for detecting differences between means of a soil property in the inter-windrow and beneath-windrow positions was highly dependent on the soil property assessed and the acceptable relative sampling error.

We studied the spatial heterogeneity of the soil around the palm by measuring comprehensive soil quality in a 24 -year-old oil palm plantation. Soil quality and litter were assessed in five zones with different plant cover, and different applications of herbicide or fertilizer. Physical-chemical characteristics, macrofauna, and nematofauna were analysed. A sampling method was developed and adapted {{to the way the}} cultivation practices are implemented: sampling by zone and weighting the plot mean by the respective area of each zone. The total density of macrofauna in the litter and in the 0 - 15 cm soil layer followed a gradient from the harvest pathway (29 ind m(- 2)) <b>to</b> the <b>windrow</b> (1003 ind m(- 2)). Ants (13 - 237 ind m(- 2)), earthworms (11 - 120 ind m(- 2)), Dermaptera (0 - 35 ind m(- 2)), Coleoptera (3 - 24 ind m(- 2)) and Chilopoda (0 - 43 ind m(- 2)) were the main taxa. The termite population was very poor (3 - 4 ind m(- 2)). The density of nematofauna was also heterogeneous (268 - 805 ind 100 g(- 1) of soil). Heterogeneity between zones was also reflected in the density of the functional groups, mainly soil engineers, detritivores and predators for macrofauna and bacterial feeders, and phytoparasites for nematofauna. The weeded circular zone around the palm had the highest soil nutrient content (P, K, Ca, Mg, C-org CEC, base saturation). Its biodiversity was average but it contained the highest density of earthworms and nematofauna. Possible relationships between chemicals and biological groups in the food web are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), {{derived from the}} decomposition of windrowed harvest residues, was examined in the establishment phase of a second rotation (2 R) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn) plantation in subtropical Queensland, Australia. Following harvesting and site preparation, when residues were formed into windrows, in situ N mineralisation was measured in positions along the three tree-planting rows formed between the windrows. The position above the windrow had a higher nitrification rate than the other positions, averaging about 18 kg N ha- 1 /month compared with 12 and 9 Kg N ha- 1 for the positions between and below the windrow positions, respectively. This position also had consistently greater soil moisture. Macroplots were formed extending 5 m above and 10 m below a windrow. Windrowed residues within the macroplots were replaced by 15 N-labelled material comprising hoop pine foliage, branch and stem. Hoop pine trees were planted within each macroplot with foliar samples taken at 12 and 24 months. Differences in foliar 15 N enrichment between positions within macroplots were < 1 鮠Soil samples were taken from positions along the macroplots at 6 -monthly intervals. Samples revealed an initial release of labile C and N but soil d 15 N showed that residue-derived N was largely immobilised within the windrows for the 30 -month sampling period. Whilst the use of windrows may act {{as a barrier to}} the down-slope movement of water, the residue N within the windrows may not be available to the trees of the following rotation for a considerable period following planting. Trees closest <b>to</b> the <b>windrows</b> may be able to introduce roots under the windrows thereby gaining access to the available N, but trees in the central tree planting row are unlikely to derive any significant benefit from the decomposition of windrowed residues.

50|$|By analogy, {{the term}} {{may also be}} applied to a row of any other {{material}} such as snow, earth or materials for collection. Snow windrows are created by snow plows when clearing roads of snow; where this blocks driveways the windrow may require removal. Snow <b>windrowed</b> <b>to</b> {{the centre of the}} street can be removed by a snow blower and truck. In preparing a pond or lake for ice cutting, the snow on top of the ice, which slows freezing, may be scraped off and windrowed.Earth windrows may be formed by graders when grading earthworks or dirt roadsLeaf windrows may be required for municipal collection.Fossil windrows, also 'gyres', are a grouping of fossils that have been deposited together as a result of turbulence or wave action in a marine or freshwater environment. Fossils of similar shape and size are commonly found grouped or sorted together as a result of separation based on weight and shape. Seaweed windrows form on sea or lake surfaces because of cylindrical Langmuir circulation just under the surface caused by wind action.Windrow composting is a large scale vermicomposting system where garden and other biodegradable waste is shredded, mixed and windrowed for composting.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the windrow turning frequency on the pro-liferation and dispersion of Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) at a classic, open-air windrow composting site was investigated. Independent of the turning frequency, the intially high con-centrations of AF (> 106 cfu/gDW) were strongly reduced already after 2 weeks of composting {{in the center of}} all exper-imental windrows, {{as well as at the}} surface of those being turned frequently (daily). Surface AF counts, however, remained elevated (> 104 cfu/gDW) for the less frequently (weekly <b>to</b> monthly) turned <b>windrows.</b> Also, in this case, con-centrations of AF dispersed in the air were higher. Tempera-ture, the main factor for eliminating AF, rose faster, more homogeneously, and reached higher values in the more fre-quently (daily and/or weekly) turned composts than in those turned less frequently. Significant differences were seen between daily and weekly turnings of material with high a C/N ratio (40 : 1), but not for the more nutrient rich composts (C/N 30 : 1), where temperatures were generally higher. Due to the reduction of AF on the compost surface by fre-quent turnings, health risks for the personnel working at com-posting sites can be diminished...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{describes the}} handling of biodegradable park and garden waste in the municipality of Lund in Sweden, from these three different perspectives: impact on environment, energy consumption and costs. Today‘s methods, {{as well as some}} other different possibilities in recycling of park and garden waste are investigated. A limitation in the analysis is that all the park and garden waste handled in the municipality is either composted or returned directly to the area after shredding. Composting may be carried out either regionally at SYSAV's "mattress" compost plant (see fig. 2) at Spillepeng in Malmö, or locally on a smaller scale in the municipality of Lund. These limitations allow the impact on the environment to be equal to the fuel consumption for transports and treatment of park and garden waste. More than 7000 tonnes of park and garden waste are produced in the municipality of Lund every year. Almost half of this comes from the household‘s garden waste. The remainder originates from different housing companies, church-yard management, parks etc. Almost half of the park and garden waste from the municipality of Lund is transported to the regional "mattress" compost at Spillepeng. The rest is treated at local windrow composting plants, by home composting or by composting in different areas e. g. in residential areas and in allotments, and by bringing it back, after shredding, to where it originated. Transporting park and garden waste is both energy consuming and expensive, since the material is voluminous. By shredding the park and garden waste it is possible to increase volume weight by four to six times. With the higher volume weight the efficiency of the transports will increase as well. While the distance of transport exceeds 25 km, {{the handling of}} park and garden waste will not be as costly and energy consuming if it is shredded before the transport to a mattress compost plant, as when it is transported unshredded. The cost and energy consumption for the shredding are covered by the higher efficiency in transport, at this distance. Most of the larger composting plants for park and garden waste in Sweden are big central windrow composts. There are small differences in costs and energy consumption between different sizes of windrow composts. This means that long transports of park and garden waste <b>to</b> large central <b>windrow</b> compost plants, compared to short transports <b>to</b> small <b>windrow</b> compost plants, is not a way to save costs and energy. Composting at "mattress" compost plants is not as costly and energy consuming as composting in windrow compost plants. On the other hand, to make a "mattress" compost plant profitable, there must be more than 5000 tonnes of park and garden waste composted every year. If the park and garden waste is shredded at a recycling station it may also be possible to compost it in windrows at the station. Costs and energy consumption for composting park and garden waste are higher at local windrow composts than at regional "mattress" composts. The costly and energy consuming transports of park and garden waste, on the other hand, makes the handling less energy consuming and costly if the park and garden waste is composted locally at a <b>windrow</b> compost, compared <b>to</b> transporting it to a regional mattress compost, if the transport distance exceeds 5 - 6 km. If` all park and garden waste from the municipality of Lund is transported to the regional "mattress" compost plant at Spillepeng, the cost and fuel consumption are calculated to be approx. SEK 5. l millions and approx. 125 m 3 diesel/year respectively. If all the park and garden waste is handled within the municipality by home composting of garden waste and by shredding all the park waste before transport <b>to</b> a local <b>windrow</b> compost, the cost is calculated to decrease to less than SEK 3 millions and the fuel consumption is calculated to decrease to about 20 m 3 diesel/year. Composting is not an end in itself, but it is a way to recycle park and garden waste from green urban areas. By bringing the biodegradable organic material back directly after shredding it, it is also possible to recycle park and garden waste. Another way of recycling is burning ligneous material and digesting biodegradable material with a high amount of nitrogen, followed by spreading of ash and digestion rests. To evaluate the impact on the environment and costs for these alternatives further research is needed. To clarify differences in emissions and the impact on the environment of different processes of decomposition of park and garden waste such as "matress" composting, windrow composting, home composting, natural decomposition, digesting and burning, thorough measurements of emissions from these processes are needed...|$|R
