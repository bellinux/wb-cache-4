Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, {{the extent to which the}} thoughts are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} into a lower-class family in Quảng Trị Province, in the {{southern}} part of French Indochina as Lê Văn Nhuận. Little is known about his family and childhood. He first came in contact with revolutionary <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s through his work as a railway clerk. Lê Duẩn was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party (the future Communist Party of Vietnam) in 1930. He was imprisoned in 1931 and released in 1937. From 1937 to 1939 he climbed the party ladder. He was rearrested in 1939, this time for fomenting an uprising in the South. Lê Duẩn was released from jail following the successful Communist-led August Revolution.|$|E
5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own <b>thoughts.</b> <b>In</b> this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive ability to differentiate and employ abstract versus arousing <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year that Anstey (and his friend William Hayward Roberts) were working on their Elegia Scripta in Coemeterio Rustico, Latine reddita (1762), another Latin version was {{published}} by Robert Lloyd with the title Carmen Elegiacum. Both were subsequently included in Irish collections of Gray’s poems, accompanied not only by John Duncombe’s “Evening Contemplation”, as noted earlier, but in the 1775 Dublin edition by translations from Italian sources as well. These included another Latin translation by Giovanni Costa and two into Italian by Abbate Crocci and Giuseppe Gennari. The pattern of including translations and imitations together continued into the 19th century with an 1806 bilingual edition in which a translation into French verse, signed simply L.D., appeared facing the English original page by page. However, the bulk of the book was made up of four English parodies. Duncombe’s “Evening contemplation” was preceded by a parody of itself, “Nocturnal contemplations in Barham Down’s Camp”, which is filled, like Duncombe’s poem, with drunken roisterers disturbing the silence. Also included were Jerningham’s “The Nunnery” and J.T.R’s “Nightly <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> the Temple”, the latter set in the gated lawyer’s quarter in London.|$|E
5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a lot of what Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed Burnout 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body: the characters' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game. During gameplay, the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms: this enables the player to see <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> different non-player characters (NPCs), with each form showing {{different types of}} thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs. The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players {{have the option of}} spending money on in-game items. The characters' base is a room in a small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons. A message board in the town provides access to social features. In the town, NPC-run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in-game currency, along with the buying and selling of various in-game items.|$|E
5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E

5|$|Tizard put his <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> a 27 April 1936 {{letter to}} Hugh Dowding, {{who was at}} that time the Air Member for Research and Development. He also sent a copy to Watt, who {{forwarded}} it to the researchers who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. This would mean the CH stations would only need to get the fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar {{for the rest of the}} interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.|$|E
5|$|Kor (John Colicos), a revered Klingon warrior, is in Quark's Bar {{telling stories}} of past battles {{to his friend}} Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). She notices Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) nearby and invites him to meet Kor, who greets Worf happily, saying that anyone who is so {{strongly}} disliked by the Klingon government {{is a friend of}} his. He explains to Jadzia and Worf that he is on the station as part of his plan to find the legendary Sword of Kahless. The sword is the original bat'leth, used by Kahless to defeat the tyrant Molor. Kor received a shroud from a Vulcan science team, which he believes once held the Sword. He gives it to Jadzia to test the shroud's authenticity. As he returns to his quarters, Kor is attacked by a Lethean who reads his <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> order to find out about the Sword and then removes his memories of the attack. Jadzia finds him the following morning, and thinks that he has passed out from too much alcohol. She has verified the authenticity of the shroud. Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) lends the trio a Runabout to travel into the Gamma Quadrant to search for the sword on a planet where the Vulcan team found the shroud.|$|E
