At high altitude the power losses beacuase of the air density that decreases, which results in less fuel can be burned. The decreasing of air density also gives rise to fatigue failure of the turbocharger unless power is reduced. <b>The</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>shall</b> be as required by BAE Systems Hägglunds economically sustainable and defensible from a packing perspective. That means the selected solution must have a reasonable price tag {{and at the same time}} a minimal impact on adjacent components. The basis for this thesis is based on benchmarking of both the auto industry as the flight industry, to find inspiration and tips for improvement. Some of the concepts have after gathering facts and calculations been excluded while other solutions has been considered as workable and thus interesting for BAE Systems Hägglunds. Initially the current turbochargingsystem was analyzed in order to determine the starting point and thus be able to fix the current problems surrounding high altitude driving. Since then, various concepts has been studied in form of single turbocharger, twostage turbocharging, turbocharger-supercharger compound, material exchange of impeller and engine optimization. The solution that is concidered to works especially well for BAE Systems Hägglunds tracked vehicle series, is to complement the current turbocharging setup with a centrifugal supercharger. ...|$|R

40|$|The SAFEFOODS {{framework}} proposes {{an integrated}} five-step procedure for the risk analysis. The five steps are: framing, risk assessment, evaluation, risk management, and review. The framework {{is designed to}} address both risks and benefits. The SAFEFOODS approach introduces a 20 -member Interface Committee, headed by a risk manager, to run the procedure. First third of the members is risk managers, second third is independent scientific experts and the last third is stakeholders with economic interests and with consumer interests. The role of the different steps in the procedure {{and the role of}} each category of Committee Members during the process are described. <b>The</b> <b>proposal</b> suggests a strict separation of responsibilities between managerial members on one side and scientific members and stakeholder members on the other side.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to outline an understanding of Digital Inclusion – DI within Information Science – IS in Brazil. We analyzed the theses and dissertations on DI in this area dating from 2001 to 2009. The data collection instruments included surveys conducted at the CAPES Theses and Dissertations Bank and information science graduate programmes to identify the documents presented in the sub-area of DI, {{in addition to the}} analysis of the Lattes curricula of their researchers and semistructured interviews carried out with most of them. In the study of these documents, issues such as the profile of theses and dissertations that analyzed the DI on the IS have been explored; the thematic approach of each survey with its area of concentration and line of research; research issues and proposed objectives; the IS authors that approached DI and were cited in the theoretical reference; the methodology used in each research and the authors cited during the methodological approach. In the semistructured interviews, the researchers' opinion on DI was addressed; each one’s professional background and subsequent motivation to search DI; the reasons to study for a master's/ doctorate degree in IS, as well as the criteria for choosing the educational institution where they performed such studies; the research experience in IS as an area of knowledge; the effective contribution of IS for growth and improvement of DI; each researcher's awareness about other research already conducted on DI; the influence of the outcome of each research in implementing policies/ actions for DI; relations between the cybercafes, telecentres and DI; the contributions of research to the personal, professional and academic background of each interviewee; his view on the current situation of discussions on DI; how the dissemination of the research results was performed and the contribution of each study to the theoretical consolidation of DI in IS. The obtained results show that DI is understood as a result of actions which, with the input from ICTs, are able to contribute to the acquisition of information literacy by the party subject to these actions, enabling them to remedy in the long-term the unfavorable aspects from their social context, achieving their own well-being and their surrounding communities’. However, DI is unlikely to be implemented in its fullness, whether through public, private or third sector initiatives, without a redefinition of public policies in line with the social context where these political actions happen. The telecentre model discussed and presented in these studies is not convincing to elect him as the ideal for the achievement of the primary goal of DI that is social inclusion. Another aspect of paramount importance is the finding that libraries are, in detriment to the telecentres, the ideal locus for the development of any DI action. Only the creation and implementation of practical methodologies aimed at achieving information literacy of the subjects {{and the development of a}} model of social indicators encompassing all the steps to be attained, highlighting the social changes that can be attributed to <b>the</b> <b>proposals,</b> <b>shall</b> be able to transform ID into social inclusion. To achieve this purpose, we advise the construction of a complete portfolio of studies already carried out on DI in IS through institutional repository; the accurate and consistent definition of terms about DI adopted in the area; the complete description of data collection and analysis methods, contextualizing them in the environment where the research is conducted; new studies based on theoretical frameworks focused on IS as a knowledge area, albeit permeated by interdisciplinarity; the creation of an inter-institutional IS study group on DI; relational analyses between research conducted on DI in similar IS graduate programmes and the elaboration of a basic model for ID actions focusing on the subjects’ development of information literacy linked to the design of reliable diagnoses on these actions and their results...|$|R
