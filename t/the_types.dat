5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based {{astronomers have}} led to the identification of differences in <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions. They differ in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of lava flow, and whether it is confined within volcanic pits.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of the {{original}} timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some of <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of wood used. It {{is possible that the}} ship was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Several {{negative}} effects {{may be attributed}} to the drinking of hot chocolate. <b>The</b> <b>types</b> and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate. Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk. Processed cocoa powder usually contains additional sugars. Some brands also contain hydrogenated oils and fats, the most common of which are coconut derivatives.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> D and E Voiturettes {{were similar}} to <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> C but with some differences, mostly the 5CV {{upgraded}} engine. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> D was identical to <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> C excepting <b>the</b> retractable roof and <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> E showed a longer roof than that of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> B, but without any door.The <b>Type</b> G used <b>the</b> same chassis and body style than <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> D and E but with an upgraded engine.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 96 {{features}} {{a more powerful}} engine, improved electronics and a western-style turret. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 96 was developed from a Type 85-IIM prototype with a 800-hp diesel engine and explosive reactive armor (ERA), and expertise gained form <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 85 such as the modular armor design, this version was accepted by the PLA in 1996, and entered service in 1997. Production of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 88 stopped when <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 96 became available, and <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 96 was mass-produced in larger numbers than <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 88, though sometimes mistakenly referred to as <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 88C.|$|R
50|$|Demons {{were among}} the first monsters {{introduced}} in the earliest edition of the game, in the Eldritch Wizardry supplement (1976).

5|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all <b>the</b> <b>types</b> found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>types</b> of {{clothing}} worn and {{the materials used}} during the Han period depended upon social class. Wealthy folk could afford silk robes, skirts, socks, and mittens, coats made of badger or fox fur, duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather, pearls, and silk lining. Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp, wool, and ferret skins.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 38 was {{produced}} in 1926 and 1927. [...] It used the 2 L (1991 cc/121 in³) engine from <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 35A [...] "Tecla". The supercharger from <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 37A was later fitted, making <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 38A. Its gearbox and brakes were later used in <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 40, while its radiator and axles were shared with <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 43.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 97 is {{approximately}} 120 lb lighter than <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94 90-mm mortar. This weight saving was created {{largely by the}} elimination of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94's recoil mechanism, which weighed 110 lb. The bipod assembly of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 97 is 14 lb lighter than that on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94. There is a cover for the level on the yoke of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 97 which is not on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94, and <b>the</b> sliding bracket of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 97 is hinged to permit its easy removal from the leg of the bipod, whereas it is integral on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94.Certain compromises in material and workmanship {{were made in the}} manufacture of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 97. <b>The</b> bipod feet and chain hooks were held to the legs of the bipod by pins, joined with solder, whereas on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94 they are welded. No welds were polished on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 97, although no indications of fractures were reported despite the poor quality of the welding. The adjusting nut, sliding bracket, and hand wheels of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 97 are made of steel, rather than brass which was utilized in <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 94.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 88-III prototypes were {{accepted}} into PLA service as <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 88C/Type 96. [...] The most visible difference between <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 96 and earlier Type 88 tanks was the additional spaced armor {{located on the}} turret. This spaced armor gave <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 96 a rectangular front profile, visually distinguishing it from the round turret of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 88C. Other visible differences included their armament. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 96 possessed a locally designed 125mm smoothbore gun while <b>the</b> earlier <b>Type</b> 88 variants used a 105mm rifled gun instead. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 96 {{was meant to be}} a [...] "close-to equivalent" [...] of its third generation contemporary, <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 99 MBT.|$|R

5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to <b>the</b> <b>types</b> described below is difficult.|$|E
5|$|White dwarf {{stars have}} their own class that begins with the letter D. This is further sub-divided into the classes DA, DB, DC, DO, DZ, and DQ, {{depending}} on <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This {{is followed by a}} numerical value that indicates the temperature.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 58 {{was later}} {{upgraded}} by having it fitted with sights from <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 59 main battle tank. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 59 tank was then designed and developed in China. Over <b>the</b> years, <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 59 tank was upgraded with various domestic and western technologies. When the PLA captured a Soviet T-62 from the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969, improvements {{based on the}} T-62 were incorporated into the T-59 design to become <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 69 MBT, which was further upgraded with western technology and became <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 79 MBT. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 59 was <b>the</b> beginning of China's first-generation MBT, and <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 79 was <b>the</b> last, superseded by <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 80 second-generation MBT.|$|R
50|$|Another {{improvement}} of <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 052D is that <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> H/PJ87 100mm gun on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 052C {{is replaced by}} a new single barrel 130 mm gun, designated as <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> H/PJ38 CIWS.|$|R

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into <b>the</b> <b>types</b> appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E
5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{versions}} of the T1000 stock have earlier been used on the Oslo metro. This includes 146 cars of <b>the</b> <b>types</b> T1 through T4, that have third-rail only operation, and thus did not run on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås lines. These ran usually in units of three or six (sometimes four or five) cars. Types T5 to T8, 49 in total, delivered with both third-rail and overhead wire equipment, normally ran on the Holmenkollen line (two cars) and Kolsås line (three cars).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> III U-boat was a 1934 {{project for}} a {{purpose-built}} minelayer based on <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> IA U-boat. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> III U-Boat {{would have been}} similar to <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> IA, but with a hull lengthened by 7.5 m, and a total displacement of 970 tons. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> III U-Boat was planned to carry an armament of 54 to 75 mines (depending on <b>the</b> <b>type</b> carried), two 105-mm deck guns, and one 20-mm antiaircraft gun.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 1936C was {{intended}} as an improvement upon both <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 1936A and B destroyers. <b>The</b> <b>Type</b> 1936C was very similar in basic hull and identical in machinery to <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 1936A, with <b>the</b> major {{difference between the two}} being <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 1936C's use of turbines originally intended for use by the Spähkreuzers, and their heavier firepower.|$|R

5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>types</b> {{of insects}} {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly {{to break up}} before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E
5|$|André conferred with General Clinton, {{who gave}} him broad {{authority}} to pursue Arnold's offer. André then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold. This initial letter opened a discussion on <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were to be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to {{be passed on to}} André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide <b>the</b> <b>types</b> A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E
25|$|Here, m has <b>the</b> <b>type</b> M t, n has <b>the</b> <b>type</b> M (M r), f has <b>the</b> <b>type</b> t → u, and g has <b>the</b> <b>type</b> t → M v, where t, r, u and v are {{underlying}} types.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>type</b> 2 {{secretion}} system (often {{referred to}} as <b>the</b> <b>type</b> II secretion system or the T2SS) is protein secretion machinery found in various species of Gram-negative bacteria, including various human pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae. <b>The</b> <b>type</b> II secretion system is one of six protein secretory systems that are commonly found in gram negative bacteria along with <b>the</b> <b>type</b> I secretion system, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> III secretion system, <b>The</b> <b>type</b> IV secretion system, the chaperone/usher pathway, the autotransporter pathway/type V secretion system and <b>the</b> <b>type</b> VI secretion system (some bacteria also utilize <b>the</b> <b>type</b> VII secretion system). Like these other systems, <b>the</b> <b>type</b> II secretion system enables the transport of cytoplasmic proteins across the lipid bilayers {{that make up the}} cell membranes in gram negative bacteria.|$|R
