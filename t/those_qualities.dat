5|$|More {{recent studies}} however suggest that Eutharic's Amali ancestry {{may have been}} a {{deliberate}} invention on the part of Theoderic to aid his ambitions of establishing dynastic credibility. According to Gesta Theoderici Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house of Alan rather than the house of Amal. Whilst Jordanes, in his history of the Goths, does make reference to Eutharic's prudentia et virtus, or pride and valour, this too {{may have been a}} fabrication on the part of Theoderic. <b>Those</b> <b>qualities</b> were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology, expressed in their code of civilitas. It would have been highly beneficial for Theoderic's chosen son-in-law to possess them.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would provide}} the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting.

This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for <b>those</b> <b>qualities,</b> and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E

25|$|Von Hartmann {{called his}} {{philosophy}} a transcendental realism, because {{in it he}} professed to reach by means of induction from the broadest possible basis of experience a knowledge of that which lies beyond experience. A certain portion of consciousness, namely perception, begins, changes and ends without our consent and often in direct opposition to our desires. Perception, then, cannot be adequately explained from the ego alone, {{and the existence of}} things outside experience must be posited. Moreover, since they act upon consciousness and do so in different ways at different times, they must have <b>those</b> <b>qualities</b> assigned to them which would make such action possible.

500|$|According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are {{mutually}} exclusive types of rational thought, each attempting to prescribe {{a way of}} life based on religious dogma. Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth. However, to both <b>those</b> <b>qualities</b> were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference. Confucianism's goal was [...] "a cultured status position", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are [...] "tools of God". The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism. Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian. Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.|$|E
