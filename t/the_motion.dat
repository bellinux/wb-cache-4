5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of the boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used}} to simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, while {{a member}} of the Centre Party, Sven-Olle Olsson, a former farmer, was elected as Sjöbo's Municipal commissioner.The Centre Party in Sjöbo, led by Olsson, motioned before Sjöbo's {{municipal}} assembly in June 1987 for a referendum on the acceptance of foreign refugees in the municipality. <b>The</b> <b>motion</b> came after a proposal that fifteen refugees be accepted into the municipality, an idea Olsson disliked. It has been speculated that the reason behind <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> was not these fifteen refugees, a small number for the municipality, but, instead, Olsson's idea to create a protest against Sweden's positive stance on refugees. Despite heavy protests from most of the country, Sjöbo's municipal assembly decided in October 1987 to go through with the referendum in 1988. If the referendum passed, it would completely ban Sjöbo from accepting foreign refugees.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate: (1) whether the use of <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> {{computer}} program will be more effective in the acquisition of transformation geometry concepts in eighth-grade students than the use of the Mira hands-on manipulative, (2) whether the use of <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> computer program will be more effective in the development of mental rotation skills in eighth-grade students than the use of the Mira hands-on manipulative, and (3) possible sex differences resulting from the use of <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> computer program or the use of the Mira, hands-on manipulative in the acquisition of transformation geometry concepts by eighth-grade students. The study included 15 teachers at 15 different junior high schools teaching 560 students. The study sample consisted of 16 classes, eight classes in each of the two experimental groups. There were 14 classes in the testing effect control group. Eight teachers each taught a Motions class and a Mira class. The remaining seven teachers taught two control classes each. The subjects were pretested and posttested with The Card Rotations Test from the Kit of Factor-Referenced Tests and the researcher-designed Transformation Geometry Achievement Test. The subjects were also administered the researcher-designed Computer Experience Questionnaire. During the period of time between the pretests and the posttests, the experimental group subjects studied a three-week series of lessons on transformation geometry concepts. To check for a possible mental rotation testing effect, the control group subjects studied a three-week unit on fractions and decimals. Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance. With regard to mathematics achievement of transformation geometry concepts, the analysis revealed no significant difference between the class means: (1) of the Mira and <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> groups, (2) of the females in the Mira and <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> groups, and (3) of the females in either <b>the</b> Mira, or <b>Motions</b> groups and of the males in either <b>the</b> Mira or <b>Motions</b> groups. A significant difference, at the 0. 05 level, was found between the mean of the males in the Mira and <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> groups. With regard to mental rotation ability, the analysis revealed no significant difference between the class means: (1) of the Mira and <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> groups, (2) of the males in the Mira and <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> groups, and (3) of the females in the Mira, and of <b>the</b> <b>Motions</b> groups...|$|R
