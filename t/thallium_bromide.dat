The favorable charge transport properties and high electrical resistivity of CdTe and CdZnTe have made them ideally suited to applications requiring spectroscopy at higher X-ray energies. Imaging applications, such as SPECT, require detectors with a pixelated electrode that allow objects to be imaged in 2D and 3D. Each pixel of the detector requires its own chain of readout electronics and for a highly pixelated detector this requires the use of a high sensitivity application-specific integrated circuit.|$|E

The FTIR spectra were acquired using the Video Assisted Measure option of the Bruker™ OPUS software (v. 5.0). For each spot, we acquired one spectrum in unpolarized infrared (IR) light and two spectra in polarized IR light taken at orthogonal orientations corresponding to maximum and minimum pleochroism under polarized light. The IR polarizer was gold-coated <b>thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> iodide, {{and it had}} 87 % polarization efficiency. The IR source was a mid-IR lamp, and a KBr beam splitter was used. Spectra were collected with a[*]×[*] 15 IR objective and a nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector, and the values were calculated over the range of 4, 000 to 700  cm- 1 at 4  cm- 1 resolution by averaging 100 scans. The spot sizes were adjusted from 50 [*]×[*] 50 to 30 [*]×[*] 30  μm square areas to measure an optically clear, homogenous part of crystal. Every sample measurement consisted of a background measurement followed by acquisition of spectra from several grains.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> (TlBr) has {{attracted}} attention as an exceptional radiation detector material. Due to its high atomic number (81 for Tl, 35 for Br) it has excellent stopping power for hard X-ray and gamma rays {{and due to}} its high bandgap (2. 7 eV) its operation requires no or only modest cooling. Promising energy resolutions have been demonstrated with detectors fabricated from high-purity samples (3. 3 keV for 60 keV photons). These properties make TlBr the material of choice for hard X-ray imaging spectrometers in applications where small weight and/or size is important (e. g. space astrophysics and nuclear medicine). The charge response and spectroscopic performance of a semiconductor imaging array depend not only on material properties but on the pixel properties as well. It has been demonstrated, for instance, that the ratio between pixel size and thickness of the detector {{is an important factor}} for the charge response. This is known as the small-pixel or near-field effect. In this paper we investigate the optimization of TlBr pixel properties in a broader context, taking into account material properties (electron and hole mobility, diffusion and trapping), fabrication details and the specific energy range of application, with a view to optimizing both the response and energy resolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to advance the development of a micro-analysis technique for characterizing the charge transport properties in bulk semiconductor materials for room temperature nuclear radiation detection. The technique is applied to bulk semi-insulating <b>thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> (TlBr) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) and uses a two-dimensional diffusion model and transport imaging to make rapid contact-free measurements of the magnitude and spatial variation in the mobility-lifetime () product at 2 m resolution. The product is a key measure of charge transport, and a uniform product is critical for optimum energy resolution in gamma ray detectors. Spatial variations in the ambipolar diffusion length are observed in TlBr on a scale of ~ 10 m, and the cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrum in TlBr at 5 K is reported. Using CL and photo-induced conductivity transient spectroscopy (PICTS), an empirical energy level diagram for Se and Pb defect levels in TlBr is reported. The product in TlBr is generally found to decrease with increasing impurities/defects. The product in TlBr and CZT is found to decrease with increasing temperature over the ranges of 8 K 102 K and 5 K 60 K, respectively. Transport imaging is applied {{for the first time to}} investigate the effects of Te inclusions in CZT and the role of photon recycling in TlBr and CZT. Lieutenant Colonel, United States Arm...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thallium</b> <b>Bromide</b> (TlBr) is an {{attractive}} material for high energy radiation detection due to its large molecular weight and wide energy band gap. However, TlBr exhibits levels of ionic conductivity {{that can lead to}} undesirable dark current leakage, believed to result in polarization of the material with consequent long term degradation in performance. The role of donor and acceptor dopants in controlling the ionic conductivity of single crystals of TlBr was investigated by adding Pb (donor) and S or Se (acceptor) at nominal 100 ppm levels using zone refining and vertical Bridgman methods. Their bulk electrical properties were examined as a function of temperature (20 - 300 °C) with frequency dependent impedance spectroscopy (see figure 1), resulting in the formulation of a predictive ionic conductivity and defect equilibria model based on contributions from Br and Tl vacancies. Due to the ~five orders of magnitude higher mobility of Br vacancies, as compared to Tl vacancies, an optimum level of approximately 4 ppm donor concentration is required to minimize the dark ionic conductivity (see figure 2). Additionally, acceptor dopant ex-solution with decreasing temperature was observed, with predictions on solubility limits as a function of temperature discussed [3]. Lastly, a temperature induced conductivity relaxation method was developed to probe the extent of mechanical damage in samples. A dislocation density of ~ 1010 cm- 3 was derived...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> (TlBr) is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} ionic semiconductor with excellent radiation detection properties. However, at room temperature, TlBr devices polarize under an applied electric field. This phenomenon not only degrades the charge collection efficiency of the detectors but also promotes chemical reaction of the metal electrodes with bromine, resulting in an unstable electric field and premature failure of the device. This drawback has been crippling the TlBr semiconductor radiation detector technology {{over the past few}} decades. In this exhaustive study, this polarization phenomenon has been counteracted using innovative bias polarity switching schemes. Here the highly mobile Br− species, with an estimated electro-diffusion velocity of 10 − 8 cm/s, face opposing electro-migration forces during every polarity switch. This minimizes the device polarization and availability of Br− ions near the metal electrode. Our results indicate {{that it is possible to}} achieve longer device lifetimes spanning more than 17 000 h (five years of 8 × 7 operation) for planar and pixelated radiation detectors using this technique. On the other hand, at constant bias, 2500 h is the longest reported lifetime with most devices less than 1000 h. After testing several biasing switching schemes, it is concluded that the critical bias switching frequency at an applied bias of 1000 V/cm is about 17 μHz. Using this groundbreaking result, it will now be possible to deploy this highly efficient room temperature semiconductor material for field applications in homeland security, medical imaging, and physics research...|$|E
40|$|Wide bandgap {{semiconductors}} {{are being}} widely investigated {{because they have}} the potential to satisfy the stringent material requirements of high resolution, room temperature gamma-ray spectrometers. In particular, Cadmium Zinc Telluride (Cd 1 -xZnxTe, x~ 0. 1) and <b>Thallium</b> <b>Bromide</b> (TlBr), due to their combination of high resistivity, high atomic number and good electron mobility, have became very promising candidates for use in X- and gamma-ray detectors operating at room temperature. In this study, carrier trapping times were measured in CZT and TlBr as a function of temperature and material quality. Carrier lifetimes and tellurium inclusion densities were measured in detector-grade Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) crystals grown by the High Pressure Bridgman method and Modified Bridgman method. Excess carriers were produced in the material using a pulsed YAG laser with a 1064 nm wavelength and 7 ns pulse width. Infrared microscopy was used to measure the tellurium defect densities in CZT crystals. The electronic decay was optically measured at room temperature. Spatial mapping of lifetimes and defect densities in CZT was performed to determine the relationship between defect density and electronic decay. A significant and strong correlation was found between the volume fraction of tellurium inclusions and the carrier trapping time. Carrier trapping times and tellurium inclusions were measured in CZT in the temperature range from 300 K to 110 K and the results were analyzed using a theoretical trapping model. Spatial mapping of carrier trapping times and defect densities in CZT was performed to determine the relationship between defect density and electronic decay. While a strong correlation between trapping time and defect density of tellurium inclusions was observed, there was no significant change in the trap energy. Carrier trapping times were measured in detector grade <b>thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> (TlBr) and compared with the results for cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) in a temperature range from 300 K to 110 K. The experimental data was analyzed using a trapping model. In CZT, because the majority carrier concentration is close to the intrinsic carrier concentration, the trapping time increases exponentially as the temperature decreases below about 160 K. While, in TlBr, the majority carrier concentration is many orders of magnitude greater than the intrinsic carrier concentration and the trapping time followed a temperature dependence over the range of temperatures studied. The results of the model suggest that a moderately deep compensation center, located approximately 200 meV {{from the middle of the}} bandgap, could be used to significantly increase the room temperature trapping time in TlBr. The results of this model demonstrate that the room temperature trapping time in TlBr can, in principle, approach 0. 1 ms through the introduction of a moderately deep compensation level but without decreasing the overall trap concentration. This strategy is not possible in CZT, because the band gap is too small to use a moderately deep compensation level while still maintaining high material resistivity. Carrier trapping times were measured in three polycrystalline TlBr samples produced by melting commercial TlBr beads in a sealed quartz ampoule for two hours at three different temperatures near the melting point. The trapping time decreased with increasing melting temperature, presumably due to the thermal generation of a trap state...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe high {{permeability}} of K+ {{channels to}} monovalent thallium (Tl+) ions {{and the low}} solubility of <b>thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> salt were used to develop a simple yet very sensitive approach {{to the study of}} membrane localization of potassium channels. K+ channels (Kir 1. 1, Kir 2. 1, Kir 2. 3, Kv 2. 1), were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and loaded with Br− ions by microinjection. Oocytes were then exposed to extracellular thallium. Under conditions favoring influx of Tl+ ions (negative membrane potential under voltage clamp, or high concentration of extracellular Tl+), crystals of TlBr, visible under low-power microscopy, formed under the membrane in places of high density of K+ channels. Crystals were not formed in uninjected oocytes, but were formed in oocytes expressing as little as 5 μS K+ conductance. The number of observed crystals was much lower than the estimated number of functional channels. Based on the pattern of crystal formation, K+ channels appear to be expressed mostly around the point of cRNA injection when injected either into the animal or vegetal hemisphere. In addition to this pseudopolarized distribution of K+ channels due to localized microinjection of cRNA, a naturally polarized (animal/vegetal side) distribution of K+ channels was also frequently observed when K+ channel cRNA was injected at the equator. A second novel “agarose-hemiclamp” technique was developed to permit direct measurements of K+ currents from different hemispheres of oocytes under two-microelectrode voltage clamp. This technique, together with direct patch-clamping of patches of membrane in regions of high crystal density, confirmed that the localization of TlBr crystals corresponded to the localization of functional K+ channels and suggested a clustered organization of functional channels. With appropriate permeant ion/counterion pairs, this approach may be applicable to the visualization of the membrane distribution of any functional ion channel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> is an {{attractive}} material for room-temperature gamma-ray spectroscopy and imaging because of its high atomic number (Tl: 81, Br: 35), high density (7. 56 g/cm^ 3), and a wide bandgap (2. 68 eV). In this work, 5 mm thick TlBr detectors achieved 0. 94 % FWHM at 662 keV for all single-pixel events and 0. 72 % FWHM at 662 keV from the best pixel and depth using three-dimensional position sensing technology. However, these results were limited to stable operation at - 20 C. After days to months of room-temperature operation, ionic conduction caused these devices to fail. Depth-dependent signal {{analysis was used to}} isolate room-temperature degradation effects to within 0. 5 mm of the anode surface. This was verified by refabricating the detectors after complete failure at room temperature; after refabrication, similar performance and functionality was recovered. As part of this work, the improvement in electron drift velocity and energy resolution during conditioning at - 20 C was quantified. A new method was developed to measure the impurity concentration without changing the gamma ray measurement setup. The new method was used to show that detector conditioning was likely the result of charged impurities drifting out of the active volume. This space charge reduction then caused a more stable and uniform electric field. Additionally, new algorithms were developed to remove hole contributions in high-hole-mobility detectors to improve depth reconstruction. These algorithms improved the depth reconstruction (accuracy) without degrading the depth uncertainty (precision). Finally, spectroscopic and imaging performance of new 11 ~x~ 11 pixelated-anode TlBr detectors was characterized. The larger detectors were used to show that energy resolution can be improved by identifying photopeak events from their Tl characteristic x-rays...|$|E

40|$|<b>Thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> (TlBr) {{has emerged}} as a remarkably well-suited {{material}} for room temperature radiation detection. The unique combination of high-Z elements, high density, suitable band gap, and excellent electrical transport properties present in TlBr have brought device performance up to par with CdZnTe (CZT), the current market-leading room temperature radiation detector material. TlBr research is at an earlier stage than that of CZT, giving hope that the material will see even further improvement in electronic properties. Improving a resistive semiconductor material requires knowledge of deep levels present in the material and the effects of these deep levels on transport properties. Very few deep level studies have been conducted on TlBr, and none with the depth required to generate useful growth suggestions. In this dissertation, deep levels in nominally undoped and doped TlBr samples are studied with electrical and optical methods. Photo-Induced Conductivity Transient Spectroscopy (PICTS) is used to discover many deep levels in TlBr electrically. These levels are compared to sub-band gap optical transitions originating from defects observed in emission spectra. The results of this research indicate that the origin of resistivity in TlBr is likely due to deep level defects pinning the Fermi level at least ∼ 0. 7 eV from either the conduction or valence band edge. The effect of dopants and deep levels on transport in TlBr is assessed with microwave photoconductivity decay analysis. It is found that Pb-, Se-, and O-doping decreases carrier lifetime in TlBr, whereas C-doping does not. TlBr exhibits weak ionic conductivity at room temperature, which both negatively affects the leakage current of detectors and leads to device degradation over time. Researchers are actively looking for ways to reduce or eliminate the ionic conductivity, but are faced with an intriguing challenge of materials engineering: is it possible to mitigate the ionic conduction of TlBr without harming the excellent electronic transport properties? Doping TlBr in order to control the ionic conductivity has been proposed and shown to be effective in reducing dark ionic current, but the electronic effects of the dopants has not been previously studied in detail. In this dissertation, the electronic effects of dopants introduced for ionic reasons are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis dealt with single crystals of <b>thallium</b> <b>bromide</b> grown for gamma-ray detector applications. The crystals were used to fabricate room temperature gamma-ray detectors. Routinely produced TlBr detectors often are poor quality. Therefore, this study concentrated on developing the manufacturing processes for TlBr detectors and methods of characterisation {{that can be used}} for optimisation of TlBr purity and crystal quality. The processes under concern were TlBr raw material purification, crystal growth, annealing and detector fabrication. The study focused on single crystals of TlBr grown from material purified by a hydrothermal recrystallisation method. In addition, hydrothermal conditions for synthesis, recrystallisation, crystal growth and annealing of TlBr crystals were examined. The final manufacturing process presented in this thesis deals with TlBr material purified by the Bridgman method. Then, material is hydrothermally recrystallised in pure water. A travelling molten zone (TMZ) method is used for additional purification of the recrystallised product and then for the final crystal growth. Subsequent processing is similar to that described in the literature. In this thesis, literature on improving quality of TlBr material/crystal and detector performance is reviewed. Aging aspects as well as the influence of different factors (temperature, time, electrode material and so on) on detector stability are considered and examined. The results of the process development are summarised and discussed. This thesis shows the considerable improvement in the charge carrier properties of a detector due to additional purification by hydrothermal recrystallisation. As an example, a thick (4 mm) TlBr detector produced by the process was fabricated and found to operate successfully in gamma-ray detection, confirming the validity of the proposed purification and technological steps. However, for the complete improvement of detector performance, further developments in crystal growth are required. The detector manufacturing process was optimized by characterisation of material and crystals using methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarisation microscopy, high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass (HR-ICPM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet and visual (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), current-voltage (I-V) and capacity voltage (CV) characterisation, and photoconductivity, as well direct detector examination. Väitöskirjatutkimus keskittyy talliumbromidikiteisiin, joita hyödynnetään gammasäteiden havainnoimisessa. Kiteistä valmistettiin huoneenlämmössä toimivia gammadetektoreita.
