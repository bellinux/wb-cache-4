5|$|Sri Lankan Tamil {{nationalism}} is {{the conviction of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people, a minority ethnic group in the South Asian island country of Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon), that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to constitute an independent or autonomous political community. This idea has not always existed. Sri Lankan Tamil national awareness began during the era of British rule during the nineteenth century, as Tamil Hindu revivalists tried to counter Protestant missionary activity. The revivalists, led by Arumuga Navalar, used literacy {{as a tool to}} spread Hinduism and its principles.|$|E

25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, {{knowing full well}} that they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent because they are ignorant of the fact that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony that the suspect consented to the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh all questions of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.|$|E

25|$|Visa runs are {{frowned upon}} by {{immigration}} authorities, as such acts may signify that the foreigner wishes to reside permanently and might also {{work in that}} country, purposes that visitors are prohibited from engaging in and usually require an immigrant visa or a work visa.

25|$|When {{the detectives}} are certain <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> suspect(s), {{the police will}} take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though {{sometimes}} the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office {{to see if the}} case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.|$|E

25|$|On April 25, 2016, the Pennsylvania Superior Court {{announced}} that it refused to hear Cosby's appeal to have the case dismissed. The court also lifted a temporary stay of the pre-trial hearing and sent the case {{back to the original}} court. At a preliminary hearing on May 24, a judge found that there was enough evidence to proceed with a trial, despite the fact that Constand did not testify, which is allowed under Pennsylvania law. He set a pre-trial hearing for September 6, 2016. Cosby is appealing this decision based upon the belief <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to cross examine the accuser. On October 12, 2016 Cosby lost this appeal. The State Supreme Court is set to review the Pennsylvania law in a separate case, Cosby's lead attorney, Brian McMonagle, said that he would try and add Cosby's case to this appeal in hopes of having it thrown out.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, Sweden {{passed a}} {{temporary}} {{law that allows}} the government to oblige all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and is valid until 21 December 2018. The government decided that the new rules will apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The new law led to the mandatory train change and passage though border control at Copenhagen Airport for travellers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency. Sweden introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), but that could not stop the migrant flow, since <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground. First when the transport companies had to stop foreigners on the Danish side, asylum seekers were efficiently stopped. This caused considerable disruption to the train traffic since the railway station did not have capacity for such checks.|$|E
25|$|Norway's {{regional}} administration is organised in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them subdivided into 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is {{a provider of}} vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.|$|E

25|$|On May 15, 2015, the Government of Jalisco {{disarmed}} {{the municipal}} police forces of Villa Purificación and Unión de Tula. Villa Purificación had 19 {{police officers and}} one police chief, while Unión de Tula had 11 police officers and one police chief. All of them were ordered to appear in court. Legally, the state government {{had the power to}} disarm municipal forces because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to grant and revoke licenses for bearing arms. Governor Sandoval explained that this non-violent procedure took three hours and was done in light of the measures proposed through Operation Jalisco and the attacks of May 1. He also explained that the state government conducted a large-scale investigation and discovered that organized crime groups had infiltrated their police ranks. Around 150 state officials participated in the disarmament. Jalisco's security commissioner Francisco Alejandro Solorio Aréchiga informed the press that they retrieved 36 rifles (20 from Villa Purificación and 16 from Unión de Tula), 46 handguns (20 from Villa Purificación and 26 from Unión de Tula), and nine vehicles (four from Villa Purificación and five from Unión de Tula). In a communiqué, the state government explained that public security duties would fall under state and federal authorities.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|Opponents of the Jacobins saw the Ventôse Decrees as {{a cynical}} ploy {{to appeal to}} the militant extreme left. Sincere or not, Saint-Just made impassioned {{arguments}} for them. One week after their adoption, Saint-Just urged that the Decrees be exercised vigorously, and hailed them for ushering in a new era: [...] "Eliminate the poverty that dishonors a free state; the property of patriots is sacred but the goods of conspirators are there for the wretched. The wretched are the powerful of the earth; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to speak as masters to the governments who neglect them." ...|$|E

50|$|So by {{the time}} Periyar {{resigned}} from the Congress, he knew that to enable the backward community people to come up, they {{must be made to}} realise that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to claim equality with the so-called upper classes, and that, in fact, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to claim proportionate representation in public offices. Thus, some of these themes constituted the platform of his future work. It should be said to the credit of Periyar that his repeated public meetings on the question of communal representation forced the government to pass G.O.No.1129 on 15 December 1928 by which Brahmins, non-Brahmins, Christians, Muslims and depressed classes were assured of proportionate representation in public offices.|$|R
