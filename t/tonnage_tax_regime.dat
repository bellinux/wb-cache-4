40|$|South Africa is an {{open economy}} and its {{economic}} growth, prosperity and welfare depend on fully accessing global trade opportunities. Consequently, government is continuously seeking to improve the country’s trade and investment environment. This is to be achieved through a host of interventions {{to reduce the cost}} of doing business and investing in South Africa. These measures include the introduction of an industrial policy framework, establishment of a robust and predictable tax system, customs administration and tariff reforms, and the stepping up of investments in road, rail and ports infrastructure. In the 2005 Budget, government announced its intention to investigate the possible introduction of a <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> in keeping with long-term trade facilitation initiatives. This notional or presumptive corporate income tax system would align South Africa’s shipping tax regime with the fiscal systems of other major maritime nations. The tonnage tax will also form an integral part of Government’s Maritime Transport Agenda: 2010 which, inter alia, seeks to arrest the decline of the domestic shipping register. By potentially bringing shipping companies ’ key strategic management decisions back to South Africa the scope of secondary support activities will broaden. This includes a growth in crewing opportunities fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{acceleration}} of economic globalisation, {{over the past}} few decades, has put the role of the state, as an important actor in the management of the global economy, in the spotlight. The question that continues to dominate the globalisation debate is whether or not individual states, operating within a neoliberal paradigm, {{are in a position to}} effectively regulate the economic activities of powerful multinational capital, manage domestic economies and protect labour. The main aim of this thesis is to assess how effectively nation states can respond to globalisation and mitigate negative impacts such as the decline of domestic industries and local labour markets while maximising the benefits. Shipping is one of the most globalised industries and one where capital is highly mobile. The challenges facing nation states in their attempt to manage domestic economies and protect local industries are therefore well illustrated in the relationship between the state and multinational shipping capital. The UK, along with other Traditional Maritime Nations, has been dramatically affected by the globalisation of the industry. Following a huge decline in the UK's merchant shipping fleet, the UK government has attempted to respond, by way of a tonnage tax. This is primarily a tax incentive to encourage ship-owners to register and operate their ships in the UK. The <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> contains within it a training commitment by which the ship-owners undertake to recruit and train UK cadets. An assessment of the performance of the strategy reveals that, whereas it has boosted significant growth in UK registered tonnage, it has achieved little success with regard to increasing the number of qualified junior officers. It is this paradox that comprises the focus of this study. Using interview data collected from key stakeholders in the UK shipping industry the thesis analyses the form and impact of the tonnage tax. The main conclusion is that, having initially committed to the advocacy of the neoliberal agenda and the concept of free capital markets, states are no longer capable of effectively responding to globalisation and the consequent negative impact on domestic economies. Because of the growing influence of corporate capital and the fear of capital flight, the limitations of state policies is especially evident in the British shipping industry in relation to the decline of local seafaring labour.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study and {{evaluate}} the Norwegian <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system {{and its impact on}} Wilhelmsen Group. Background/Problem: The maritime sector has always been highly affected by financial and political shocks. So when Norway introduced their new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system, it came as a great shock for shipping companies located in Norway. They now had to decide whether to enter the new system or not. Method: To solve the purpose, Wilhelmsen's annual reports has been scruti-nised in order to create an overview look of the impacts of the new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system. In addition, useful information has come from several journals and seminars attended at BI 2008. Conclusion: The findings of this thesis argues that the New Norwegian <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system is in its core state, where many changes are still being made. However what has been established is that the new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system is profitable, and that Wilhelmsen group wants to apply for this new system, shows its successfulness...|$|R

40|$|The tax {{treatment}} of the shipping industry over the last 30 years exhibits alternative forms of corporate taxation systems implemented by various governments. A consensus view {{of the way in}} which shipping should be treated for tax purposes has resulted in the widely adopted form of the <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax.</b> The aim of the paper is to examine the success or otherwise of such shipping fiscal policies in respect of widely accepted perspectives and set objectives. The focus of the study is on the UK registry, investigating the impact of the introduction of the UK <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax.</b> Noteworthy results emerge along with the understanding that, in the long run, the <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> seems to be connected more with the 'flagging out' of foreign owned tonnage than with the 'flagging in' of nationally owned vessels. The findings can be considered to have broader implications for the competitiveness of national ship registries and for policy making...|$|R

40|$|The {{recession}} {{that started in}} the late 2000 s has created significant economic and financial challenges globally and within nation states. In particular, oil-producing countries have been further affected by the fall in oil price. It is therefore crucial that alternative, more sustainable methods of sourcing revenue be investigated and utilised. The purpose of this thesis therefore {{is to examine the}} use of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> as a sustainable revenue source in promoting economic growth and development in Nigeria. Using a qualitative legal analysis, of the Nigerian corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and through an extensive literature review, the thesis identified a number of key findings. Inter alia, that revenue from corporation tax structures are a sustainable revenue source mostly because of the amount of revenue generated through Multinational Corporations (MNCs). Secondly, the existing Nigerian corporation <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> is in need of reform as there are developmental challenges, including lack of implementation and ambiguous legislation, which continue to thwart its success. Therefore, this leads to establishing how, and to what extent that Nigeria can use its corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> as a sustainable revenue source. The answer to this lies in the legal framework of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> This thesis argues that legal uncertainties in the corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> are the principal reason for the challenges faced by both state governments and MNCs. The thesis concludes by recommending reforms to the Nigerian <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> while also recommending a tax compliance strategy for both domestic and international corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> This will set a foundation for corporation <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> as a sustainable revenue generation source for developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} consistency test reveals that Maryland applies systematically higher “county” taxes to interstate commerce than to in-state commerce. Economic analysis of Maryland’s <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> — including its taxes on inbound, outbound, and domestic activities — confirms what the {{internal consistency}} test suggests, namely, that the Maryland “county” tax discourages interstate commerce. Specifically, the Maryland <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> discourages Maryland residents from earning income outside of Maryland, and it simultaneously discourages nonresidents from earning income in Maryland. Maryland alone causes this distortion; the distortion {{does not depend on}} the taxes imposed by any other state. Petitioner’s argument that Maryland’s outbound <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> should be upheld because it is facially neutral when compared to Maryland’s domestic tax requires the Court to ignore Maryland’s inbound tax on nonresidents. Ignoring relevant parts of a state’s <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> obscures the overall effect of that regime on interstate commerce. Although crediting other states’ taxes would cure Maryland’s dormant Commerce Clause violation, other practical and legitimate alternatives for curing the violation exist.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} the study is to find a metric-variable of {{competitiveness}} for each country's <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and {{to assess the impact of}} <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> differentiation across the common market. A country adopting competitive taxation policies manages to attract productive factors, funds and investments from other intra- and inter-countries. The value added tax (VAT), property tax as well as corporate and personal taxes are examined for the twenty seven (27) European Union (EU) countries. The methods applied consist of Least Square Dummy variable models and the results from the estimations for each one of the aforementioned taxes are integrated into a new total competitiveness taxation index (TCTI), following weighted hierarchical quantitative approaches. Our findings suggest that significant differences still exist between the countries examined and the application of diverse <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> systems results in various tax performances. Using the above procedure, we also find that subgroups exist within the (27) EU countries and that EU lacks taxation policies with common rules or restrictions.

Second, in the Netherlands, the tax-deductibility of mortgage interest payments is almost unre-stricted. The <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> of owner-occupied homes increasingly erodes the personal income tax base in the Netherlands, so that higher tax rates are needed to collect a given amount of revenue. However, elimination or reduction of the mortgage interest deduction can only be realized gradually. Due to a lack of data both within the various <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> and across time periods, a comprehensive multivariate time-series comparison among the various <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> in the EU- 15 is not pos-sible.

But persistent cohort effects in the choice of <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and substantial unobserved corporation-specific effects indicate that non-tax factors matter as well.

40|$|Neither an {{international}} tax, nor {{an international}} taxing body exists. Rather, there are domestic taxing rules adopted by jurisdictions which, coupled with double tax treaties, apply to cross-border transactions and international taxation issues. International bodies {{such as the}} OECD and UN, which provide guidance on tax issues, often steer and supplement these domestic adoptions but have no binding international taxing powers. These pragmatic realities, together with the specific {{use of the word}} ‘regime’ within the tax community, lead many to argue that an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> does not exist. However, an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> should be defined no differently to any other area of international law and when we step outside the confines of tax law to consider the definition of a ‘regime’ within international relations it is possible to demonstrate that such a regime is very real. The first part of this article, by defining an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> in a broader and more traditional context, also outlining both the tax policy and principles which frame that regime, reveals its existence. Once it is accepted that an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> exists, it is possible to consider its adoption by jurisdictions and subsequent constraints it places on them. Using the proposed changes to transfer pricing laws as the impetus for assessing Australia’s adoption of the international <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> the constraints on sovereignty are assessed through a taxonomy of the level adoption. This reveals the subsequent constraints which flow from the broad acceptance of an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> through to the specific adoption of technical detail. By undertaking this analysis, the second part of this article demonstrates that Australia has inherently adopted an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> with a move towards explicit adoption and a clear embedding of its principles within the domestic tax legislation...|$|R
