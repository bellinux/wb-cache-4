5|$|More than 600 wing {{members were}} mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle, and the wing began flying around-the-clock combat air patrol {{missions}} immediately thereafter. This continued until February 2002. On 22 December 2001 the wing escorted American Airlines Flight 63 {{as a direct}} result of Richard Reid trying <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> a plane.|$|E
5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the aircraft using explosives {{that had been}} hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{explicit}} supersymmetric deformation of supergravity backgrounds describing D 3 -branes on Calabi-Yau cones. From the geometrical point of view, it corresponds <b>to</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> a 4 -cycle in the Calabi-Yau {{and can be}} done universally. In the field theory, we identify this deformation with motion on non-mesonic directions in the full moduli space of vacua. For {{the case of a}} Z 2 orbifold of the conifold, we discuss an explicit gravity solution with two deformation parameters: one corresponding <b>to</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> a 2 -cycle and one corresponding <b>to</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> a 4 -cycle. The generic case where the Calabi-Yau is toric is also discussed in detail. Quite generally, the order parameter of these 4 -cycle deformations is a dimension six operator. We also consider probe strings which show linear confinement and probe D 7 branes which help The AdS/CFT correspondence has provided an alternative approach to the study of gauge theories at large ’t Hooft coupling [1]. One of the most powerful properties is that the correspondence provides a prescription for its deformation via the state/operator correspondenc...|$|R

5|$|In Dead or Alive 4 (2005), Ayane {{has pledged}} {{her life to}} her {{half-brother}} and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans. Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E
5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{had been}} looking for someone to turn into a martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a member of the Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> a train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered.|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud {{was released from prison}} two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.|$|E

According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E

During negotiations at Vancouver International Airport, Nielson allowed the other 13 passengers and one crew member to disembark, leaving three crew members aboard the plane with him. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) then stormed the plane and arrested Nielson, finding that he was armed only with two toy guns. There were no fatalities in the incident.|$|E

5|$|Tequila {{finds the}} last {{baby in the}} {{maternity}} unit, and carries it to safety while fighting off {{the last of the}} gangsters. Alan and Tequila meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the building. Alan pursues Wong as Tequila escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate Tequila, Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots himself through the stomach giving Tequila enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and Tequila burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{ultimately}} decided when {{the rising tide}} lifted Rhett's sloops free while temporarily leaving the Royal James stranded. Bonnet was left helpless, watching while the enemy vessels repaired their rigging and closed to board his paralysed vessel. Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men would have had little hope of winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Royal James's powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by {{the remainder of the}} crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3October.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} way to purify uranium oxide in a laboratory was {{to take advantage of the}} fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 {{as part of}} an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E

Two days before the Soviet Army occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.|$|E
