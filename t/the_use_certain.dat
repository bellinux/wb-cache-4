40|$|I provide in my preface a brief {{account of}} my {{development}} as a creative writer. Through this development I draw an analogy {{to the evolution of}} modern science by stating that my need for personal clarity is analogous to the charge for empirical clarity of modern science. Furthermore, I contrast the objectivism of modern science to the subjectivism of creative writing. The four short stories in my thesis range from a semi-autobiographical story, to two short stories that stem out further and further from the subjective origin of the first story. The story of greatest distance is “Fireflies,” which is not semi-autobiographical, but pure fiction. The final short story returns to the subjective origin of the first. The drive of Distances is thereby to create a sort parabola: a subjective, semi-autobiographical origin, to an objective, purely fictional crest, then a return to that subjective, semi-autobiographical origin. The entire collection is a holistic, ultimately subjective, and therefore personal experience; yet, through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>certain</b> tropes,metaphors others can relate to, the stories are paradoxically sharable...|$|E

The first pathway is caused when stock market indices, seen {{as a set of}} coupled integrate-and-fire oscillators, synchronize in frequency. The integrate-and-fire dynamics happens due to "change blindness", a trait in human decision making where people have the tendency to ignore small changes, but take action when a large change happens. The second pathway happens due to feedback mechanisms between market performance, and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>certain</b> (decoupled) trading strategies. The third pathway can take place because of communication and its impact on human decision making. A model is introduced where financial market performance has an impact on decision making through communication between people. On the other hand the sentiment created via communication has an impact on the financial market performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was {{an exploration of}} the employee induction process within a business environment. A case study was used {{in order to get a}} better understanding of how the induction process works and the consequences of an inadequate process. The investigation focused on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>certain</b> features that could potentially enhance the effectiveness of induction and the experience of employees new to a role or Company. Induction is the initial period of employment where a person is acclimatising to a new role. The process involves transferring significant amounts of information to the new employee so they can get up to speed and become as productive as people already employed. A poor process can lead to feelings of inadequacy and people can take longer to be comfortable and efficient in the role. This is then a cost to the employer and a difficult start for the new employee. This research focused on two specific constructs within employee induction. These were the use of technology and mentoring. Technology is the use of any online or computer based solutions. The findings of the study showed the use of technology and mentoring, in a blended approach, can enhance the effectiveness of induction for employers and employees. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>certain</b> {{codes to}} cover {{important}} message {{are very important}} for the announcers, especially when they have to deliver the announcement on the air (by microphone). The language used by the announcers for the customers is different from the language used by the announcers for the employees. The writer found that they are using certain codes to give announcements to the employees, and common language to the customers. This phenomenon attached the writer to investigate the register used by the Announcers in the Information Center of Matahari Department Store in Plaza Tunjungan 3 Surabaya to find out the types of the register. The study under report then has the following research question What are the types of register found in the language used by the announcers in the information centre of Matahari Department Store in Plaza Tunjungan 3 Surabaya? The theories used are the theories belonging to sociolinguistics, they are register based on the related-user: field, tenor and mode, and the types of register. In order to get the needed data, the writer recorded the utterances of the announcers in the information center of Matahari Department Store in Plaza Tunjungan 3 Surabaya, and then transcribed them into written form. The writer then analyzed the data based on the parameters set up: first, the writer analyzed to find the notation of the register {{on the basis of the}} first parameters: field, tenor, and mode, then, the writer determines the types of the register: formal register, informal register or reporting register. The result of the first data analysis shows that the language used by the announcers in the information center of the Matahari Department Store is included in register. The result of the second data analysis shows that they are three types of register can be found: formal register, informal register and reporting register. The writer hopes that this study can make the understanding of register better that other people outside the community will understand the language, especially about the announcements uttered by the announcers for the employees in the information centre of Matahari Department Store in Plaza Tunjungan 3, Surabaya. For further researches, the using of modern technology such as handy cam, to record not only the voice but also the gesture and the expression of the announcers, it can help to have a clearly explanations about reporting register...|$|E
