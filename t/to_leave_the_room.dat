Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick).

5000|$|In response, Levin {{argues that}} a novel color {{experience}} does in fact yield new factual knowledge, such as [...] "information about the color's similarities and compatibilities with other colors, {{and its effect on}} other of our mental states." [...] Tye counters that Mary could have (and would have, given the stipulations of the thought experiment) learned all such facts prior <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> without needing <b>to</b> experience the color firsthand. For example, Mary could know the fact [...] "red is more like orange than green" [...] without ever experiencing the colors in question.|$|R

5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan.

He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen had <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's rear wall, clinging {{to each other and}} screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{styles of}} guards, the basic guards, and the SS Stormtroopers who wear {{bullet-proof}} vests {{marked with the}} SS insignia. The basic guards are not very intelligent, reacting only {{to the sounds of}} gunshots and grenades, or after seeing the player wandering around without a uniform, and will gladly walk their patrol paths into your raised gun and surrender to a search. Additionally, they are unable <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> they are stationed in. The SS guards are much smarter and, once alerted, tend to chase <b>the</b> player from <b>room</b> to room. They require a large number of rounds or a grenade to kill.|$|R

Washbrook made 98, sharing a stand of 187 with Peter May, after England had been reduced to 17 for three. England won the game, and Washbrook stayed in the team, scoring just 6 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, in which Jim Laker took his record-breaking 19 wickets as England went two-one up. The Fifth Test at The Oval saw Washbrook's last Test innings, a duck, but with the game drawn, England had won the Ashes.|$|E
25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in.

The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although few will provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki to pinch her cheek and awaken. This behavior ensures that the player has {{a way out of the}} dream world at all times.|$|E

500|$|The {{player is}} not able <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and must use a camera system and two doors with lights in order to defend {{themselves}} from the animatronics.

60|$|Amabel sighed, {{and knew}} {{she ought to}} be convinced. The very pain it gave her to lose sight of that green, grave, the chestnut-tree, and <b>the</b> white mountain; <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> and {{passages}} which still, to her ears, were haunted by Guy's hushed step and voice, and to part with the window where she used each wakeful night to retrace his profile as he had stood pausing before telling her of his exceeding happiness; that very pain made her think that opposition would be selfish. She must go some time or other, and it was foolish to defer the struggle; she must not detain her parents in an infected place, nor keep her mother from Charles. She therefore consented, and let them do what they pleased,--only insisting on Arnaud's being left with Philip.|$|R
