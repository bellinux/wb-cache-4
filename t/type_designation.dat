5|$|The Iore {{class was}} a cold-adapted and heavy-haul {{derivation}} from Adtranz's Octeon modular electric locomotive platform, which {{was launched in}} 1998 {{on the basis of}} Adtranz's latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time. Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at Kassel, Germany. When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated modular locomotive platform, the <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> TRAXX H80AC was applicable to the Iore class, however, it was excluded from the TRAXX family {{by the time of the}} second batch order in 2007. The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

25|$|After the war, the six {{surviving}} {{ships in}} this class were decommissioned between 1947 and 1949 {{and placed in the}} reserve fleet. The ships received a new <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> of CLAA in 1949. None of this ships were recommissioned to serve in an active role; all were ultimately struck and scrapped by 1970.|$|E
25|$|The Russian <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> is Small Anti-Submarine Ship. The Grisha-class anti-submarine {{ship was}} {{designed}} to search for and destroy enemy submarines found in coastal areas. They were equipped {{with a variety of}} ASW weapons and an SA-N-4 surface-to-air missile launcher. All were fitted with retractable fin stabilizers. Some of them (the Grisha II class) were built for the border guard.|$|E

25|$|The cloth or fiber {{material}} used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) {{and therefore the}} characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant, the dielectric constant (er), the loss factor (tδ), the tensile strength, the shear strength, the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the Z-axis expansion coefficient (how much the thickness changes with temperature).|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the GT {{received}} a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel {{save for the}} Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> of 11636 for left-hand drive and 11637 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels were now standard, {{as opposed to the}} earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Alenia and Lockheed Martin began discussions {{to improve}} Alenia's G.222 using C-130J's glass cockpit {{and a more}} {{powerful}} version of the G.222's T64G engine and four-blade propellers. In 1996, a program began on an improved G.222, named C-27J; it used a U.S. military <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> based on the G.222's C-27A designation. In 1997, Alenia and Lockheed Martin formed Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems (LMATTS) to develop the C-27J. The design changed to use the C-130J Super Hercules's Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engine and six-blade propeller. Other changes include a fully digital MIL-STD-1553 systems and avionics architecture, and an updated cargo compartment for increased commonality. The C-27J has a 35% increase in range and a 15% faster cruise speed than the G.222.|$|E

2500|$|The A6M {{is usually}} {{known as the}} [...] "Zero" [...] from its Japanese Navy <b>type</b> <b>designation,</b> Type 0 carrier fighter (Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki, 零式艦上戦闘機), taken from the last digit of the Imperial year 2600 (1940) when it entered service. In Japan, it was unofficially {{referred}} to as both Rei-sen and Zero-sen; Japanese pilots most commonly called it Zero-sen, where sen is the first syllable of sentōki, Japanese for [...] "fighter plane".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006–12, all Valmet Nr II+ {{vehicles}} {{underwent a}} major modification {{process in which}} a [...] low-floor midsection {{was added to the}} tram. The <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> was changed from Nr II+ to MLNRV to reflect the modifications made, and the longer trams were re-introduced in traffic gradually as the modification works were completed. During the process, HKL decided to also rebuild ten of the older Nr I trams in the same way, which brought the total number of MLNRV trams to 52 upon completion in mid-2014.|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} <b>Type</b> <b>Designations</b> {{used by the}} United States Army Air Service were allotted, using two or three letters, which were an {{abbreviation}} of the aircraft's purpose.

2500|$|The {{designation}} R (for rapid) {{was originally}} intended for locomotives with an axle load of under [...] [...] These lightweight locomotives exert less {{stress on the}} rails when they negotiate curves, and were therefore permitted to do so at higher speeds (e.g. , instead of [...] ). [...] With {{the introduction of the}} Re 4/4II, the axle load limit was dropped following extensive testing. [...] Several locomotives were later given approval for higher cornering speeds, to which their <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> had not yet been adapted (e.g. the BLS ABDe 4/8 or the [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The M97 {{was also}} fitted to the AH-1J, {{but it is}} unclear if the AH-1T, AH-1W, and AH-1Z used {{variants}} of the M97 series. The subsystem used on the AH-1T and AH-1W has a designation in the USAF's Aeronautical and Support Equipment <b>Type</b> <b>Designation</b> System (ASETDS), A/A49E-7. [...] The turret in the system is also designated under the ASETDS system, as the GTU-1/A. [...] How this system differs from its US Army counterparts is unknown. An amendment to the official Military Specification, MIL-F-85668(AS), {{put out by the}} United States Naval Air Systems Command on 15 November 1995, actually listed the [...] "A/A49E-7(V4)" [...] as inactive pending a new design, and listed the system as relevant only to the [...] "AH-1T (TOW)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The European-spec 2.5 V6 (2.5 6V Iniezione or 2.5QV) {{was officially}} sold only between 1985 and 1987, {{although}} {{some of them were}} not registered until 1989. Relatively few of them were sold (about 2800 units), especially when the [...] 1.8 Turbo got launched, which in some countries was cheaper in taxes because of its lower displacement. To create a bigger space between the V6 and the inline fours, the 2.5 was bored out to 2959 cc's to deliver [...] and this new engine was introduced as the 3.0 America in 1987. As its <b>type</b> <b>designation</b> suggests, the 3.0 only came in the US-specification, with the impact-bumpers and in-boot fuel tank. However, the European 'America's' were not equipped with side-markers or the door, bonnet and boot lid fortifications. Depending on the country of delivery, the 3.0 America could be equipped with a catalytic converter.|$|E
