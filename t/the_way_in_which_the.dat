5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|The play {{established}} Fielding as {{a popular}} London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. The Author's Farce is now {{considered to be a}} critical success and a highly skilled satire.|$|E

5|$|Two {{forms of}} juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are {{recognised}} as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea.

In 2009, a special ₩20000 coin was minted in South Korea commemorating the Yeongsan juldarigi. In Gijisi, where the sport has been practiced for at least 500 years, the traditional East/West divide is replaced with a division of teams into upriver and downriver.

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E

5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had {{to ditch}} {{in a river}} because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making {{it more difficult for}} hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk {{is known as the}} invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E

5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{has been}} of great {{importance}} to historians {{since the middle of}} the 19th century, partly because it mentions territories unrecorded in other documents. Attempts to link all the names in the list with modern places are highly speculative and all resulting maps are treated with caution. Three different versions (or recensions) of the Tribal Hidage have survived, two of which resemble each other: one dates from the 11th century and is part of a miscellany of works; another is contained in a 17th-century Latin treatise; the third version, which has survived in six mediaeval manuscripts, has many omissions and spelling variations. All three versions appear {{to be based on the}} same lost manuscript: historians have been unable to establish a date for the original compilation. The Tribal Hidage has been used to construct theories about the political organisation of the Anglo-Saxons, and to give an insight into the Mercian state and its neighbours at a time when Mercia held hegemony over a number of other peoples. It has been used to support theories regarding the origin and location of the tribes in the list and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> tribes were systematically assessed and ruled by others. Some historians have proposed that the Tribal Hidage is not a list of peoples but of administrative areas.|$|E
5|$|When the Whitlam Government came {{to power}} in late 1972, the CMF was in a very poor state. The new {{government}} moved quickly to end conscription, and this caused the CMF's strength to fall by roughly 5,000 to 23,119 by June 1973. In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.B Millar and the subsequent report developed from this inquiry became known as the Millar Report. Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted, the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time, however, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> government chose to implement the recommendations, and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed to lapse, ultimately served to at least partially justify some of the cynicism voiced in certain CMF circles about the report.|$|E
