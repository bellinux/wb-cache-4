6000|$|Dinner enough, we {{need not}} doubt. The old Feldzeugmeister has a big line Schloss at Meuselwitz; his by {{unexpected}} inheritance; with uncommonly fine gardens; with a good old Wife, moreover, blithe though childless;--and {{he is capable of}} [...] "lighting more than one candle" [...] when a King comes to visit him. Doubtless the man hurls his thrift into abeyance; and blazes out with conspicuous splendor, on this occasion. A beautiful Castle indeed, this Meuselwitz of his; the towers of Altenburg visible in the distance; Altenburg, where Kunz von Kauffungen stole the two little Princes; centuries ago;--where we do not mean to pause at this time. On the morrow morning,--unless they chose to stay over Sunday; which I cannot affirm or deny,--Seckendorf also has made his packages; and joins himself to Friedrich. Wilhelm's august travelling party. Doing here a portion of the long space (length of the <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Equator</b> in all) which he is fated to accomplish in the way of riding with that Monarch.|$|E
6000|$|Grumkow is {{sworn to}} Imperial orthodoxy, then,--probably the vulpine MIND (so to term it) went always rather that way, and only his {{interest}} the other;--Grumkow is well bribed, supplied for bribing others where needful; stands orthodox now, under peril of his very head. All {{things have been}} got distilled into the palatable state, spiritual and economic, for oneself and one's grand Trojan-Horse of a Grumkow; and the adventure proceeds apace. Seckendorf sits nightly in the TABAGIE (a kind of [...] "Smoking Parliament," [...] {{as we shall see}} anon); attends on all promenades and journeys: one of the wisest heads, and so pleasant in discourse, he is grown indispensable, and a necessary of life to us. Seckendorf's Biographer computes, [...] "he must have ridden, in those seven years, continually attending his Majesty, above 5,000 German miles," [...] [Anonymous (Seckendorf's Grand-Nephew) Versuch einer Lebensbeschreibung des Feldmarschalls Grafen von Seckendorf (Leipzig, 1792, 1794), i. 6.]--that is 25,000 English miles; or a trifle more than the length of the <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Equator.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetosonic {{waves are}} {{commonly}} {{observed in the}} vicinity of the <b>terrestrial</b> magnetic <b>equator.</b> It has been proposed that within this region they may interact with radiation belt electrons, accelerating some to high energies. These wave-particle interactions depend upon the characteristic properties of the wave mode. Hence, determination of the wave properties is a fundamental part of understanding these interaction processes. Using data collected during the Cluster Inner Magnetosphere Campaign, this paper identifies an occurrence of magnetosonic waves, discusses their generation and propagation properties from a theoretical perspective, and utilizes multispacecraft measurements to experimentally determine their dispersion relation. Their experimental dispersion is found to be in accordance with that based on cold plasma theory...|$|R
6000|$|Negotiation {{always going}} on, we say; for such indeed was the case,--the Kaiser striving {{always to be}} loose again (having {{excellent}} reasons, a secret bargain to the contrary, to wit!) in regard to that Julich-and-Berg Succession; proposing [...] "substitutes for Julich and Berg;" [...] and Friedrich Wilhelm refusing to accept any imaginable substitute, anything but the article itself. So that, I believe, the Treaty of Wusterhausen was never perfectly ratified, after all; but hung, for so many years, always {{on the point of}} being so. These are the uses of your purchased Grumkow, and of riding the length of a <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Equator</b> keeping a Majesty in company. If, by a Double-Marriage with England, that intricate web of chicanery had been once fairly slit in two, and new combinations formed, on a basis not of fast-and-loose, could it have been of disadvantage to either of the Countries, or to either of their Kings?--Real and grave causes for agreement we find; real or grave causes for quarrel none anywhere. But light or imaginary causes, which became at last effectual, can be enumerated, to the length of three or four.|$|E
6000|$|Curious to see, {{so far as}} dates go, how Friedrich Wilhelm {{changes his}} tune to Wife and Children in exact {{correspondence}} to the notes given out at Soissons for a Kaiser and his Pragmatic Sanction. Poor Prussian Household, poor back, and heart, of Crown-Prince; what a concert {{it is in this}} world, Smoking Parliament for souffleur! Let the big Diplomatist Bassoon of the Universe go this way, there are caresses for a young Soldier and his behavior in the giant regiment; let the same Bassoon sound that way, bangs and knocks descend on him; the two keep time together,--so busy is the Smoking Parliament with his Majesty of Prussia. The world has seen, with horror and wonder, Friedrich Wilhelm's beating of his grown children: but the pair of MEERKATZEN, or enchanted Demon-Apes, disguised as loyal Councillors, riding along with him the length of a <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Equator,</b> have not been so familiar to the world. Seckendorf, Grumkow: we had often heard of Devil-Diplomatists; and shuddered over horrible pictures of them in Novels; hoping it was all fancy: but here actually is a pair of them, transcending all Novels;--perhaps the highest cognizable fact to be met with in Devil-Diplomacy. And it may be a kind of comfort to readers, both to know it, and to discern gradually what the just gods make of it withal. Devil-Diplomatists do exist, at least have existed, never doubt it farther; and their astonishingly dexterous mendacities and enchanted spider-webs,--CAN these go any road but one in this Universe? ...|$|E

In other words, it is a projection of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>equator</b> out into space.

It consists of 13 large volcanic islands, 6 smaller islands and 107 rocks and islets, distributed around the line of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>equator.</b> The Galápagos Archipelago {{is one of the largest}} scientific and tourist attractions of Ecuador; undoubtedly, it is the most known and famous attractive of the country.|$|E
