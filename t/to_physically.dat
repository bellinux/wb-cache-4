40|$|Purpose : Although {{physical}} activity and exercise for stroke patients is highly recommended for fast recovery, patients in hospitals and rehabilitation centres are insufficiently encouraged <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active. In this study, we investigated the impact of knowledge brokers (KBs), enterprising nurses and therapists, on health professionals’ (HP) performance to encourage stroke inpatients <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active.   Method : This multicenter intervention study used a pre–post test design. Two or three KBs were trained in each stroke unit of 12 hospitals and 10 rehabilitation centres in The Netherlands. Questionnaires were completed by patients and HPs {{before and after the}} KB-intervention. The primary outcome was encouragement given by HPs to their patients <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active, as reported by patients and HPs.   Results : After the KB-intervention, many more patients (48 %; N= 217) reported at least some encouragement by HPs <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active than before (26 %; N= 243, p< 0. 000). HPs (N= 288) on an average reported encouraging patients more often after the intervention, but this difference was significant only for occupational therapists and KBs.   Conclusions : Based on patient’s reports of HP behaviour, the KB-intervention appears effective since more patients felt encouraged <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active after the intervention compared to before. Replication of this study in an experimental design is needed to allow causal inferences. Implications for rehabilitation We advise rehabilitation teams to make use of knowledge brokers (KBs), since the KB-intervention was shown to increase the encouragement felt by stroke patients <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active. It seems worthwhile to involve physicians, nurses and patients’ families more frequently in efforts to encourage stroke patients <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active...|$|R

40|$|Obese {{children}} are usually less active than their normal-weight counterparts, although {{the reasons for}} this remain unclear. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine how a long-term program (3 years of intervention and 6 months of follow-up detraining) of physical exercise with or without a low calorie diet influenced sedentary obese children’s intention <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active. The participants were 27 children, ages from 8 to 11 years, who formed two groups according to the program that they followed. One group followed an exercise program (three 90 -min sessions per week), and the other this same exercise program together with a hypocaloric diet. The intention <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active was assessed via the Measurement of Intention <b>to</b> be <b>Physically</b> Active (MIFA) questionnaire. The subjects’ scores at different times of the program (baseline, Year 3, and detraining) were compared using a repeated-measures ANOVA, and a post-hoc Tukey’s test was applied to confirm the differences. After both the intervention and detraining, both groups showed greater intention <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active. This suggests the suitability of long-term physical exercise to generate greater intention <b>to</b> be <b>physically</b> active and thus establish healthy life habits including increased levels of physical activity...|$|R

5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began <b>to</b> <b>physically</b> manifest dragon like attributes.

5|$|As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light {{features}} {{a variety of}} firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player uses in combat. The game's protagonist, Artyom, also {{has the ability to}} kill an enemy directly with his melee weapon. Artyom has three weapons slots. Players can put any weapon into these slots without restriction. Players have access to four different secondary weapons, including throwing knives, claymores, incendiary grenades, and hand grenades. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend <b>to</b> <b>physically</b> attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The player can knock out or kill most human enemies instead of shooting them, using stealth to avoid detection. As enemies are inefficient in spotting the player character in darkness, players can turn off oil lamps and light bulbs to gain an advantage over their opponents.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands <b>to</b> <b>physically</b> abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
