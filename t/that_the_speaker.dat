5|$|The Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the {{presiding}} {{officer of the}} United States House of Representatives, and is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate. Though the Constitution does not require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> be an elected member of the House of Representatives, every Speaker to date has been elected from House membership.|$|E
5|$|The poem is a {{detailed}} description of several objects, including a photo album and the camera that took the pictures in it, and is essentially about the nostalgia <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker,</b> presumably Gibson himself, feels towards the details of his family's history: the painstaking descriptions of the houses they lived in, the cars they drove, and even their pets.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of death is}} felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, {{a symbol of the}} beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. <b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays {{a significant role in the}} action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20).|$|E
50|$|If it occurs, it {{specifies}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> {{information is}} from some source other than personal observation or knowledge.|$|R
60|$|Dane guessed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> anxiety chiefly {{concerned}} the third who followed, and the implied question {{was the least}} difficult to answer.|$|R
2500|$|Mississippi's {{low state}} rankings {{has given rise}} to the saying [...] "Thank God for Mississippi", {{denoting}} relief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> state isn't <b>the</b> lowest.|$|R
5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The {{members of the committee}} were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E
5|$|When the {{official}} tally was announced, Taylor had {{won by a}} vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel allies, it voted 2–1 to certify the announced vote tally. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Goebel announced his decision to contest the board's decision to the General Assembly. The Assembly appointed a committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges. The members of the committee were drawn at random, though the drawing was likely rigged – only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) Among the rules the General Assembly adopted for the contest committee were: that the committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate be limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> of the House preside over the joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought the provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them despite the opposition.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue that}} was {{frequent}} among users was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> would sometimes quit working after restarting the computer, forcing the re-installation of all audio codecs and drivers.|$|R
30|$|Note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> founders effect {{scenario}} presupposes demic diffusion. Thus, {{the relative}} nondiversity of Koreanic and Japonic provides further support for <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> of <b>the</b> protolanguages arrived from elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The Committee of Privileges {{subsequently}} recommended <b>that</b> showing <b>the</b> video {{would fall}} outside proceedings in parliament and was, therefore, not protected by privilege. They further recommended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Speakers</b> actions had been wholly proper.|$|R
25|$|The hook {{indicates}} in Northern Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> {{should start}} somewhat low and fall, but in Southern Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> should start somewhat low and fall, then rise (as when {{asking a question}} in English).|$|E

25|$|A tilde {{indicates}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> {{should start}} mid, break off (with a glottal stop), then start again and rise like {{a question in}} tone.|$|E
25|$|The dot signifies in Northern Vietnamese <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> starts low {{and fall}} lower in tone, {{with the voice}} {{becoming}} increasingly creaky and ending in a glottal stop, but in Southern Vietnamese speakers starts low and rise mid in tone.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperative}} mood is used {{to describe}} an action <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> wants another person to do: Duok pinigų! – Give me some money! Iš pradžių įleiskime svečius. – Let us at first invite the guests in. This mood is actively used in modern Lithuanian.|$|E
5000|$|Maga (magázás, magázódás): Use of {{this form}} serves to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> wish to {{distance}} themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as maga. Aside from the different pronoun it is grammatically the same as [...] "önözés".|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The recent {{literature}} on ad hominem argument contends <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker’s</b> character is sometimes rele-vant to evaluating what she says. This effort to redeem ad hominems requires {{an analysis of}} character that explains why and how character is relevant. I argue that virtue epistemology sup-plies this analysis. Three sorts of ad hominems <b>that</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>speaker’s</b> intellectual character are legitimate. They attack a speaker’s: (1) posses-sion of reliabilist vices; or (2) posses-sion of responsibilist vices; or (3) fail-ure to perform intellectually virtuous acts. Legitimate ad hominems con-clude {{that we should not}} believe what a speaker says solely on her say-so. Résumé...|$|R
25|$|In April 2008, Carswell was {{reported}} to be launching plans for Speaker Michael Martin to be removed after the 2010 general election, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> had 'demonstrated that he is not the man to oversee the vital job of restoring faith in Westminster politics'.|$|E
25|$|In Mixtec, the subjunctive mood {{serves as}} a mild command. It is formed by placing the {{particle}} na before the future form of the verb. When used in the first person, it gives the impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> closely reflects on the action before performing it.|$|E
25|$|Though {{excluded}} from caucus, Parrish initially still sat as a Liberal in the House of Commons but became an independent on November 21 so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> {{would give her}} time in member's statements and question period without the notice of the Liberal whip.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{credibility}} was first derived from Aristotle who argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> reliability must be built and established in speech and <b>that</b> what <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> did or said before such a speech {{was not of}} importance. Aristotle divided the aspects of persuasion into three categories: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion) and logos (logic). As credibility refers to people believing who they trust, emotion and logic indicate a person's emotional connection and means of reasoning to convince one of a particular argument and/or speech. [...] The area of source credibility is studied for practical applications in communication, marketing, law, and political science.|$|R
50|$|Bose SoundLink II {{includes}} new neodymium transducers, dual-opposing passive radiators and {{a revised}} {{digital signal processing}} <b>that</b> gives <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> slightly better sound compared to the original version.

5000|$|... "In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, various scholars, notably William Gladstone (1858) and Lazarus Geiger (1880), noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> of ancient written {{languages}} did not name colors as precisely and consistently - {{as they saw}} it - as <b>the</b> <b>speakers</b> of modern European languages. They proposed a universal evolutionary sequence in which color vocabulary evolves in tandem with an assumed biological evolution of the color sense".|$|R
25|$|It is {{coincidental}} enough <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> {{suggests that}} the only way to immortalize his beloved as he is, is through his writing. And the way that Caesar and the others are kept alive is through writing, through history, and in some senses through Shakespeare himself.|$|E
25|$|Farage {{stood against}} sitting Buckingham MP, John Bercow, {{the newly elected}} Speaker of the House of Commons, despite the {{convention}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Speaker,</b> as a political neutral, is not normally challenged {{in his or her}} bid for re-election by any of the major parties.|$|E
25|$|While the Constitution {{requires}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> {{be elected}} by the House of Commons, traditionally this amounted to the rubber-stamp approval of a Member nominated by the Prime Minister. However, in 1986 this was changed and they are now selected by secret ballot. The Speaker remains a sitting MP, but only votes on matters {{in the case of}} a tie.|$|E
