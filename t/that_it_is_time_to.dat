5|$|After reuniting with Terra, the Returners decide <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{launch an}} all-out {{attack on the}} Empire, and Banon asks Terra to attempt {{contacting}} the espers' land {{in order to gain}} their support. Terra succeeds in making contact, and when the espers learn that the others captured by the Empire previously have now perished, they become infuriated and enter the human world, where they destroy much of Vector. When the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace. Gestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf, to which she agrees. Accompanied by Locke, Shadow (a ninja mercenary hired by the Empire for the mission), Generals Celes and Leo, the player must then guide Terra to the remote village Thamasa in search of the espers, where they meet Strago Magus and his granddaughter, Relm Arrowny, who also accompany them.|$|E
5|$|All {{the guests}} agree to stay — except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, {{they decide to}} return home but {{on the way to}} the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} {{the events of the}} first film, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is now living with the Bracketts. Michael has been missing since last Halloween and is presumed dead, while Laurie has been having {{recurring}} nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma, Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Elsewhere, Michael, who is still alive, has been having visions of Deborah's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bring Laurie home, so he sets off for Haddonfield.|$|E

5|$|The police {{discover}} Michael's {{location and}} surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside {{to try to}} reason with Michael. Inside, he finds Laurie, who is hallucinating a younger Michael holding her down, and tries telling her {{that no one is}} restraining her. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go home; Michael attacks Loomis and kills him. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif), and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of Deborah.|$|E

5|$|With his assistance, DedSec {{manages to}} expose the {{corruption}} of the FBI and numerous Silicon Valley corporations through the hacking of their data facilities. Learning that Blume is planning to install a satellite network designed to bypass undersea data cables, which would effectively give Blume a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data and stock exchanges, they infiltrate the launch area of one of the satellites to install a backdoor. In order to bring down Blume and Dušan for good, Marcus breaks into all of Blume's international headquarters and lastly their San Francisco headquarters and hacks their servers, exposing the existence of Bellwether and Dušan's corruption. Dušan is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> put their own plans into motion.|$|E

25|$|In the vineyard, the {{antepenultimate}} {{event is}} the harvest {{in which the}} grapes are removed from the vine and transported to the winery to begin the wine making process. In the Northern Hemisphere this is generally between September and October while in the Southern Hemisphere it is generally between February and April. The time of harvest depends {{on a variety of}} factors-most notably the subjective determination of ripeness. As the grape ripens on the vines, sugars and pH increase as acids (such as malic acid) decrease. Tannins and other phenolics also develop which can affect the flavors and aromas in the resulting wine. The threat of detrimental weather and vine diseases (such as grey rot) can also {{play a role in the}} time table. The balance of all these factors contributes to when a winemaker or vineyard manager decides <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> harvest.|$|E
25|$|Brent tells Neil {{that he has}} a {{date for}} the Christmas party, when he really does not. With Gareth's help, he {{searches}} Internet romance websites for suitable women, and lines up three possible candidates for blind dates. He takes the first to dinner, but accidentally steers the conversation to breasts. He calls from his car to arrange a meeting with the second woman (voiced by Julia Davis), who does not realise who Brent is, and mocks the manager from The Office documentary. Brent hangs up. On the third date, Brent immediately finds the woman unattractive and boring. Dawn returns to Britain and arrives at the office. She and Tim immediately recreate old times by winding up Gareth. Brent pushes Neil's patience too far when he brings his dog into the office to show to the staff. Neil bars Brent from the office and later stops anyone who does not work for Wernham Hogg from going to the Christmas dinner. At the party, Brent anxiously awaits his fourth blind date. When the woman, Carol, arrives, she and Brent hit it off straight away. Lee tells Dawn <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> leave. She and Tim say awkward goodbyes and she leaves with Lee.|$|E

25|$|Mating threats {{along the}} opponent's back rank often enable one to swindle. An example {{is seen in}} Rhine–Nagle, U.S. Masters 1997 (left-most {{position}}). Black, a pawn up with White's king in danger, decides <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> finish White off, forgetting that even a losing position may have defensive resources. Black continued 26...Rg5 27.Rhg1 Ra2?? A powerful-looking move, threatening mate in two, but it actually loses by force. Black could have kept a winning position with (for example) 27...Qf4+ 28.g3 Qf2+ 29.Rg2 Qf7, or 28.Kh1? Rg3 29.Qd1 Raa3 (threatening Rxh3+) 30.Qf1 Qh4 (renewing the threat) 31.Kh2 g6! (31...Ra2 32.Qf5! is weaker) and now Black is winning after 32.Ra1 Qxb4; 32.Rb2 Rgd3; or 32.Rc1? Ra2! (threatening mate on h3) 33.Kh1 Raxg2! 28.d6+ Kh8 The only reasonable move. White wins after 28...Qf7 29.dxc7! Ra8 30.Rgd1! Qxb3 31.Rd8+ Kf7 32.Rxb3 or 28...Kf8 29.Rbf1! Rxg2+ 30.Rxg2 Qxf1 31.Qxa2. 29.Qxa2!! Qxa2 30.dxc7! (right-most diagram) Turning the tables: Black, although ahead a queen for a rook, is suddenly helpless against White's passed pawn on the seventh rank. 30...Qc2 30...Qa8 31.Rbd1 Rf5 32.Rd8+ Rf8 33.Rgd1, and 30...Qg8 31.Rgd1 Rf5 32.Rd8 Rf8 33.Rbd1, also win for White. 31.Ra1! The threat of a back-rank mate decides the game. 31.Rbc1? Rxg2+! 32.Rxg2 Qxc1 33.Ra2! Qf4+ 34.Kg2 Qg5+ would allow Black to draw by perpetual check. 31...h6 If 31...Qxc7, 32.Ra8+ and mate next move. The game concluded: 32.Ra8+ Kh7 33.c8=Q Qe4 34.Qg8+ Kg6 35.Rf8 1–0.|$|E
