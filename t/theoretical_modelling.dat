In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of hollow fibers, three <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> (the parallel/series model, quadrate model and cylindrical model) and finite element method carried out by ANSYS simulation were studied. The results showed that different <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> gave quite different effective thermal conductivities. The results from <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> and simulations were completely identical in the case when models had regular structures and the heating surface was {{the same kind of}} material. The ETC of hollow fibers from all of <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> and simulations decreased exponentially with the increase of air volume content. In addition, the ETC of hollow fibers from the first <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> were a bit higher than the results from simulation, whereas those from the second <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> were smaller than the results from simulation, and those from the third <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> were identical to the results from simulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the stresses in V-section band clamps by examining the correlation between experimental work and <b>theoretical</b> <b>models.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> <b>models</b> incorporating traditional beam-bending theories and allowing for friction were developed to calculate the stress distribution and displacements within the clamps. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> demonstrated that the normal manufacturing tolerances associated with this type of component, combined with the uncontrolled operating parameters, will produce a wide variation in working stresses. These <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> were validated using strain and displacement measurements from a test with a V-section band clamp positioned around rigid anges. The experimental results all fell within the range of stresses predicted by the <b>theoretical</b> <b>models.</b> The paper provides a knowledge base for the rational design of V-section band clamps...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{international}} sport migration has been burgeoning recently. This article considers the dominant <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> used to explore these movements {{and suggests that}} it is time to rethink some of our theoretical presumptions. Recent permutations of these <b>theoretical</b> <b>models,</b> shifting from globalization to network <b>theoretical</b> <b>models,</b> make this reconsideration of migration-related theories necessary. Drawing on the groundbreaking work done in the 1990 s and on Rafaelle Poli’s rapidly expanding body of work, it becomes apparent that a more flexible, open-ended <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is necessary. This article reviews these <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> before making a suggestion of how international sport migration might be better framed for understanding how migration is structuredand experiencedin multiple locations around the world. Considering that migrants are bodies moving through space, it seems crucial to return migrants to space-based models of movement thereby advocating a <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> that takes into account the complexly dynamic relationships between migrants, institutions, and places...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{main subject}} of this thesis is <b>theoretical</b> <b>modeling</b> of bright and dark {{magneto-optical}} resonances observable on the D 1 spectral line of alkali metals. A <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> based on the rate equations for Zeeman coherences is em- ployed in the research. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> was developed from the optical Bloch equations, applying the rotating wave approximation and the decorrela- tion approach to stochastic dierential equations. In this thesis the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is adapted to describe magneto-optical resonances observed in alkali metal vapor that is conned in either an ordinary cm-sized cell or an extremely thin cell, whose thickness {{is comparable to the}} ex- citation wavelength. A method for estimating the parameters of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> for either of the experimental conditions is developed in the paper. The adapted <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is tested by comparing its results to the ex- perimentally registered data. The experimental results are obtained by exciting atoms with laser radiation and observing the dependence of the uorescence sig- nal on a magnetic eld. Atomic vapor of 85 Rb, 87 Rb, and Cs is used. Rubidium atoms are studied in both types of cells, but Cesium atoms only in ordinary cells. Altogether the results of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> describe the experimental results well. Aside from describing experiments, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is employed as an independent tool to study the saturation of the contrast of the dark magneto- optical resonances and the formation of the dark states...|$|R
