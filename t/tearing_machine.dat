Method: We use the method of testing maximum weighting of dynamic ropes. Measurement was done on a horizontal <b>tearing</b> <b>machine</b> in the Strojirensky zkusebni ustav in Jablonec nad Nisou. Results: Bigger breaking strength achieved the rope Beal Buster. It was 23. 61 kN. The rope Beal Booster achieved the breaking strength 18. 46 kN. The difference between these ropes is 5. 5 kN. We recommend the eight knot as a connecting knot for the rope Unicore, whose breaking strength was 15. 4 kN. This knot decreased the breaking strength of the rope at least. We found out the nine knot as the most sufficent knot for the ropes Beal Booster. Its breaking strength was 15. 58 kN. Key word: dynamic rope, connecting knot, knot, breaking strengt...|$|E

Each machine {{is supposed to be}} able to provide several throughputs corresponding to different operating conditions. The purpose is to provide a production scheduling that maximizes the production horizon. The use of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results in the form of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) allows to adapt the schedule to the wear and <b>tear</b> of <b>machines.</b> This work comes within the scope of Prognostics Decision Making (DM). The key point is to configure the platform, i. e., to select the appropriate profile for each machine during the whole production horizon so as to reach a total throughput based on a customer demand as long as possible. In the homogeneous case, the Longest Remaining Useful Life first algorithm (LRUL) is proposed to find a solution and its optimality is proven. The NP-Completeness of the general case is then shown. A Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) model which allows to find optimal solutions for fixed time horizons has been defined. As solving such a BILP is NP-Complete, solutions can however be computed in reasonable time only for small size instances of the problem. Many heuristics are then proposed to cope with large scale decision problems and are compared through simulation results. Exhaustive simulations assess the efficiency of these heuristics.

The objective of this work was to analysis the chemical composition which are pineapple leaf, corn stalk and Napier grass; to investigate the properties of hand sheet made from those crops; to determine the influence of different pulping process and process variables on the physical and chemical properties. Every chemical components analyse; Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Ash and Lignin content by TAPPI Test Method. All of three samples were undergo acidic and alkali pulping process. Fiber Analyser was used for fiber analysis and SEM use for observation on sample. From pulping process, the step will continue for papermaking. Lastly, tensile, bursting, folding, and <b>tearing</b> tester <b>machine</b> will test paper production. Result shows that pineapple leaf gives high cellulose content (66. 2 %) and lower lignin content (4. 2 %) compared corn stalk and napier grass. Alkaline pulping shows a quality of pulp rather than acidic pulping process due to the pulp strength and colour of fiber. Corn stalk gives a high potential to be an alternative for mechanical properties viewed. High tensile index (90. 99 Ndg), burst index (6. 64 kpa*m 21 g) and fold index (3. 51 Nm) by corn stalk paper rather than pineapple leaf and napier grass but lower in tear index (2. 85 ~ m ~ l gT) h. is wass due to the long fiber length by pineapple leaf about 13. 36 mm fi-om SEM images.

Yet, the earliest infrabiological systems may have been devoid of metabolism: such systems would have been extreme heterotrophs. We do not know what level of complexity is attainable for chemical systems without enzymatic aid. Lack of template-instructed enzymatic catalysis may put a ceiling on complexity owing to inevitable spontaneous decay and wear and <b>tear</b> of chemodynamical <b>machines.</b> Views on the origin of metabolism critically depend on the assumptions concerning the sites of synthesis and consumption of organic compounds. If these sites are different, non-enzymatic origin of autotrophy is excluded. Whether autotrophy is secondary or not, it seems that protocell boundaries may have become more selective with time, concurrent with the enzymatization of the metabolic network. Primary heterotrophy and autotrophy imply pathway innovation and retention, respectively. The idea of metabolism–membrane coevolution leads to a scenario of progressive sequestration of the emerging living system from its exterior milieu. Comparative data on current protein enzymes may shed some light on such a primeval process by analogy, since two main ideas about enzymatization (the retroevolution and the patchwork scenarios) may not necessarily be mutually exclusive and the earliest enzymatic system may have used ribozymes rather than proteins...|$|R

One way to handle the resulting large amount of data created by hundreds or even thousands of different sensors in an application is to employ information fusion systems.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} the total stellar mass in rich clusters of galaxies resides in a diffuse intergalactic component usually referred to as the Intra-Cluster Light (ICL). Theoretical models indicate that these intergalactic stars originate mostly from the tidal interaction of the cluster galaxies during the assembly history of the cluster, and that a significant {{fraction of the}}se stars could have formed in-situ from the late infall of cold metal-poor gas clouds onto the cluster. The models make predictions about the age distribution of the ICL stars, which may provide additional observational constraints. However, these models also over-predict the fraction of stellar mass in the ICL by a substantial margin. Here we present population synthesis models for the ICL of a dumb-bell dominated intermediate redshift (z= 0. 29) X-ray cluster for which we have deep MOS data obtained with the FORS 2 instrument. In a previous paper we have proposed that the dumbell galaxy act as a grinding <b>machine</b> <b>tearing</b> to pieces the galaxies that pass nearby thus enriching the intergalactic medium. In this paper we analyze the spectra at different locations within the ICL and find that it is dominated by old metal rich stars, at odds with what has been found in nearby clusters where the stars that dominate the ICL are old and metal poor. While we see a weak evidence of a young, metal poor, component, if real, these young stars would amount to less than 1 % of the total ICL mass, much less than the up to 30 % predicted by the models. We propose that the very metal rich (i. e. 2. 5 times solar) stars in the ICL of our cluster, which comprise approximately 40 % of the total mass, originate mostly from the central dumb-bell galaxy, while the remaining solar and metal poor stars come from spiral, post-starburst (E+A), and metal poor dwarf galaxies.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{introduction of}} intermittent power sources {{combined with the}} de-regulation of electricity markets has led to increased instability in the electrical grid. This has led to increased start-up and shutdown of regulating power sources such as hydro-electric power plants and operation at non-ideal operating states both of which increase the wear and <b>tear</b> on <b>machines.</b> Likewise, the push for a less environmentally intrusive society has raised the importance of utilizing equipment with reduced impact on the natural surroundings. These challenges lead to a need to improve the robustness of existing and new equipment to guarantee their usefulness in a future with increased instability. While many components in hydropower systems require thorough investigation to improve their robustness, this work {{is focused on the}} guide/journal bearings which support the rotating portion of power generating machines. This work addresses the journal bearing problem through a multi scaled approach covering small and large scale laboratory experiments as well as investigations of a full scale machine. A journal bearing test machine was constructed to investigate a number of new synthetic lubricants and polymer bearing materials. These tests found that a significant reduction in power loss could be accomplished without significantly affecting the bearing's minimum film thickness by changing from a traditional mineral oil to a high viscosity index oil of much lower base viscosity grade. The high viscosity index lubricants were then improved to reduce start-up friction as well. Further studies were conducted in small scale to determine the optimum lubricant characteristics for the startup problem. This knowledge was used to develop new lubricants to test in the journal bearing test machine which showed great reductions in power loss in the bearing and pumping system as well as greatly reduced bearing operating temperature. Further experimental work {{led to the development of}} practical guidance for power plant operators contemplating a lubricant change. This technique focuses on the importance of maintaining equivalent viscosity in the minimum film thickness region after a lubricant change. Efficiency improvements can then be calculated by comparing the viscosity in the bulk of the bearing to that with the original lubricant. Experimental work with polymer bearing facing materials demonstrated the dramatic reductions in break away friction that these materials can provide. A number of polymer composite materials were investigated for their friction characteristics at the moment of the start of sliding, finding that PTFE based materials were far superior to traditional Babbitt metal. This work with polymer faced bearings was extended to testing in a tilting pad journal bearing test rig which allowed for identification of the dynamic characteristics resulting from changes in bearing pad material. Investigations in the full scale with the Porjus U 9 unit provided valuable insight into the dynamics of a full scale machine as well as needed data for the improvement of multi-physics models of bearings. Insights from the Porjus U 9 experiments clarify many of the design challenges for large journal bearings. The results from this work demonstrate that significant performance improvement of journal bearings is possible through the use of new lubricants, materials, and adjustments in operational methods.

40|$|The {{development}} of wet gas compressors for installation subsea {{is key to}} increase the recovery {{of oil and gas}} from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Safe operation of the compressor depends on understanding of how wet gas affects the behavior of the machine. The compressor operating range is limited by stall and surge, and it is therefore particularly important to determine how liquid will affect the inception of these phenomena. Measuring pressure transients within the compressor or in the inlet and discharge pipe are widely used in experimental investigation of stall and surge. Spectral analysis of the pressure signal is used to detect aerodynamic instabilities in compressor. Pressure measurements are also {{an important part of the}} anti-surge control systems, and it is used for continuous condition monitoring of the machine. It is therefore important to determine how liquid affect the pressure measurements. This thesis consists of three main parts. The first part describes and explains stall and surge, and introduces various pressure measurement techniques that can be used to measure pressure transients in centrifugal compressors. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors are well suited to this. They have a wide operating range, high stability and sensitivity, and are very robust. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) and stress-sensitive films (S 3 F) are interesting alternatives. These techniques measure global surface pressure, which is very useful when investigating complex flow fields. The second part investigates how wet gas affects compressor stability, and how liquid presence affect pressure measurements in wet gas flows. Results from the test facility for wet gas compression at NTNU have shown that wet gas has a stabilizing effect on the compressor. Unfortunately, it is difficult to interpret the measurements due to large uncertainties around how liquid affects pressure measurements. Liquid presence may cause suppression and/or enhancement of certain frequencies, and also introduce additional frequencies that are specifically related to the dynamic characteristic of the liquid phase. The existing literature on this particular topic is very limited, but evaluation of various multiphase experiments has given some insight. It has been shown experimentally that droplets entrained in a gas phase dampen out pressure fluctuations. High frequency components will be most affected, but experiments have also shown significant dampening of frequencies down to 100 Hz. The presence of a liquid film is believed to cause amplification of random frequencies in the lower frequency range. Turbulence and vortex formation causes a chaotic and highly dynamic flow pattern in the film, and this will affect the pressure measured at the wall. The liquid film will also reduce the performance of PSP and make the use of S 3 F more complicated. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors will not be directly affected. To increase the understanding of how liquid affects the pressure measurements in wet gas flows an experiment is planned to examine how thin liquid films will affect the surface pressure in wet gas flows. More knowledge in this field is important for future research of wet stall and surge. The economical consequences of stall and surge are massive. In particular if the compressor is installed subsea. Safe running of the compressors is therefore dependent on a anti-surge system that prevents the compressor from becoming unstable. The final part of the report investigates anti-surge control in subsea compression, and how the performance of different systems is affected by liquid. Surge control based on surge avoidance is currently the safest and most reliable technique. However, the performance of these systems is significantly reduced in wet gas compression. Liquid changes the compressor characteristic, and affects the wear and <b>tear</b> of the <b>machine.</b> Liquid presence will also reduce the accuracy of flow, pressure and temperature measurements. By installing dynamic pressure sensors inside the compressor or outside in the connected pipeline, condition monitoring of the machine could be significantly improved. However, due to the challenging subsea environment and the high requirements to sensor performance, it is difficult to finding an optimal sensor is challenging. It is also difficult to determine where the sensors should be installed. This requires knowledge of how the liquid is distributed in the compressor, and will also depend on detailed knowledge of the liquid will affect the pressure measuremen...|$|R
