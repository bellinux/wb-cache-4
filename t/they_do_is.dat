25|$|The {{belief in}} angels is {{fundamental}} to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. They are spiritual beings created by God to obey him and implement his commandments. Unlike human beings, angels have no free will and cannot act independently. Under God's command, they bring revelations to the Prophets, bring punishment on the Prophets' enemies, glorify God with his praise, and keep records of human beings' deeds. Angels are not visible to the physical eye. Yet, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, they do sometimes appear to man {{in one form or}} another. This appearance, however, is not physical but a spiritual manifestation. Ahmadi Muslims regards angels as celestial beings who have their own entity as persons. The major role they play is the transmission of messages from God to human beings. According to the Quran, the entire material universe as well as the religious universe is governed by some spiritual powers, which are referred to as angels. Whatever <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> in complete submission to the Will of God and the design that he created for things. According to Islam, as interpreted by Ahmadi Muslims, they cannot deviate from the set course or functions allocated to them, or from the overall plan of things made by God.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, contradictions {{have arisen}} in the {{discussion}} of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.|$|E

500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> work, work, work," [...] Roy commented.

500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

[...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E

[...] After attending an All-American dinner at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Timberlake reported, [...] "There {{is a great deal of}} loneliness in being an All-America[...] [...] [...] I get sick of it. [...] They all want to shake your hand, but they don't really know you. [...] All <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> stick out the glad hand. [...] I don't mind talking to anyone who is interested in ideas, but nothing makes me sicker than having my name dropped by people who don't know anything about me except that I'm an All-America." [...] He joked that he might write an autobiography called, [...] "The Loneliness of an All-America." [...] He was also an A-minus student majoring in sociology, was named a scholar-athlete by National Football Association, and was placed on the Big Ten All-Academic team two years in a row.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{container}} with an ideal gas is expanded instantaneously, {{the temperature of}} the gas doesn't change at all, because none of the molecules slow down.

As a writer of a linear story, [...] "all <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to write the script," [...] he said. [...] "In game design, the writer should think about the gameplay and background story first before developing any of the characters. However, the constraints of an interactive medium {{is no excuse for}} a poorly constructed story, the big thing {{is that we have a}} different medium. We have to accept that we have not only huge advantages in the interactive medium but also big constraints. And these constraints often lead to some really shitty stories.

Bangalter elaborated that the newly recorded elements were implemented {{in a way that was}} equivalent to [...] "creating fake samples [...] where people think there are samples from disco records or funk records." [...] Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo estimated that half of the sampled material on Discovery was played live and re-recorded by the duo, and emphasized that the resulting quality of the music was more important than the ego of who played which instruments.|$|E

In 2002 she {{suffered}} an accident falling from a horse; in the accident, the horse trampled her jaw and crushed her facial bones, which required massive reconstructive surgery. Her mouth was wired shut, and she convalesced for months, using the time to write songs. The song [...] "Equus," [...] from the 2004 album Misery is a Butterfly, refers to the accident. Makino has stated that she often gains inspiration from horses while writing music: [...] "They are so musical in their movements and in the sounds they make.
