5|$|Despite the Great Depression, Silverman's travels {{expanded}} in the 1930s, {{when she began}} spending 6 months each year outside the U.S. As early as 1932, land purchase programs to buy and settle refugees on permanent homes in Palestine were being pursued by Jewish organizations. Silverman not only supported the plans and raised funds for them, but she planted the first tree in the colony at Wady Havarith. With Hitler's rise to power, Silverman's pleas for {{a safe haven for}} Jews became more urgent and her first-hand reports from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland contained explicit accounts of conditions. In 1938, Silverman was working with the Youth Aliyah Movement in conjunction with Hadassah in the U.S. to relocate 10,000 refugee children <b>to</b> <b>Palestine.</b> As a fund-raiser, Silverman's goal was to raise {{a quarter of a million}} dollars for resettlement and youth training in agricultural and vocational pursuits. In 1939, she ended her Polish tour studying the conditions and desperation, shortly before the Polish invasion, but the effort was successful in relocating some 7,000 young people from Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania <b>to</b> <b>Palestine</b> before the end of 1940.|$|E

The illegal immigration was known as Aliyah Bet ("secondary immigration"), or Ha'apalah, and was organized by the Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, {{as well as by}} the Irgun. Immigration was done mainly by sea, and to a lesser extent overland through Iraq and Syria. During World WarII and the years that followed until independence, Aliyah Bet became the main form of Jewish immigration <b>to</b> Mandatory <b>Palestine.</b>|$|R

In the 1930s, he formed bands of local fighters and launched attacks against British and Jewish targets. He was eventually killed in a manhunt following his alleged role {{in the killing of}} a British policeman. Israeli historian Tom Segev has called him 'the Arab Joseph Trumpeldor'.

In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local <b>to</b> <b>Palestine,</b> and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the sun.|$|E
