500|$|As {{with the}} ISKCON-inspired [...] "Awaiting on You All", Allison views the {{conditions}} that Harrison imposes in the song's choruses as a rare exception within the singer's work. Elsewhere, Allison continues, Harrison's songwriting reveals [...] "a strong belief in the efficacy of unmerited divine grace". In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a [...] "flexible" [...] one, adding: [...] "In one way, I'm never going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> [...] unless it's by His grace, but then again … he amount of grace I would expect from God should be equal {{to the amount of}} grace I can gather or earn." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Experience bassist Noel Redding, Hendrix {{told him}} it was about Hendrix's girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan. [...] Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also {{included}} her sister Maddy, although their house was brown. Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. [...] Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor, as the [...] "red house", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed [...] "Red House" [...] at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added [...] "I got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> because my Linda don't live here no more" [...] to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix's post-Experience groups, explained, [...] "As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place or thing. [...] It was just a blues number that Jimi put together".|$|E

2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here.</b> Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E
2500|$|The catchphrase [...] "I have a cunning plan" [...] {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the pilot episode, {{but it is not}} regularly used until the third series; Blackadder had mentioned the phrase twice in the first series and Baldrick once.

In the final episode of the last series, Blackadder Goes Forth, Baldrick announces that he has a cunning plan to save the main characters from [...] "going over the top", although it is never revealed what this plan might be (other than that it is [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University"). Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely, dismisses it, telling Baldrick [...] "Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> by pretending to be mad.
