5|$|Organothallium {{compounds}} {{tend to be}} thermally unstable, in concordance {{with the}} trend of decreasing <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also {{the lowest in the}} group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable + ion in aqueous solution: like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and 2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, <b>thermal</b> <b>stability,</b> thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
40|$|The high {{alternation}} of nematic <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> {{found in}} the series of ω-phenylalkyl 4 -(4 '-phenylbenzylideneamino) cinnamates as the homologous series was ascended has been further exaggerated by substituting the terminal phenyl ester ring with methyl or chloro substituents in the 3 "- or 4 "-positions. Nematic phases were found only when an even number (n) of methylene units occurred in the alkylene chain. Smectic <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> also alternated as {{each of the four}} series of esters was ascended. However, the smectic A <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> decreased and the smectic B <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> increased on passing from even to odd values of n. In some cases this caused the <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the smectic A and B phases to coincide for odd values of n. When this occurred, a unique texture was observed microscopically at the I-S transition. Although no SA-SB transition could be detected microscopically or by D. T. A., miscibility studies indicated that a transitional SA phase still existed. This suggests {{that it is necessary to}} form a transitional SA phase intermediate between the amorphous liquid and a SB phase, both on heating and cooling. This transition has been called SAB-I. Smectic E phases were also found for many of the sixteen new esters, and the <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> of SE phases, like those of SB phases, increased for odd values of n. The relative effects of 3 "- and 4 "-methyl- and chloro-substituents on N, SA, SB and SE <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> are discussed...|$|R

The {{introduction of a}} 4 -cyano group in a liquid crystal (LC) molecule is not accompanied by significant changes in mesophase <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> but it leads to materials with a considerable positive dielectric anisotropy.

5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its <b>thermal</b> <b>stability</b> allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower <b>thermal</b> <b>stability.</b> Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

The amount of bound water with the myofibrils in case such acidic amino acids as sodium asparaginate and sodium glutamate were added were greater than those in case either other or no amino acids were added; and their KD) values were very small showing high <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities.</b> The amount of bound water with the myofibrils in case the acidic amino acids of asparagine and glutamine, the basic amino acids of ornithine and lysine, and the neutral amino acids (six kinds) such as glycine were added were greater than those in the case of no amino acid added; and their KD values were smaller than those in the case of no amino acids. The amount of bound water with the myofibrils in case the basic amino acids of arginine and the neutral amino acids (five kinds) such as leucine were added were almost the same as those of no amino acid added, but their kD values were great showing low <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities.</b> The above-mentioned results suggest that the higher the <b>thermal</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the amino acids, the greater are in most cases the amount of bound water; and the structuralization of the water surrounding myofibrillar proteins due to the added amino acids is an important factor to suppress the denaturation of the myofibrils upon heating...|$|R
