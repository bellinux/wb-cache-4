500|$|Several Midwestern lawmakers {{commented that}} they {{continued}} to oppose EPA's consideration of the [...] "dicey science" [...] of indirect land use that [...] "punishes domestic fuels". House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson said, [...] "... to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> credibly measure the impact of international indirect land use is completely unrealistic, and I will continue to push for legislation that prevents unreliable methods and unfair standards from burdening the biofuels industry." ...|$|E

[...] "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hold our heads high because of that.

500|$|The most {{meaningful}} {{outcome of the}} Franklin expedition was the mapping of several thousand miles of hitherto unsurveyed coastline by expeditions searching for Franklin's lost ships and crew. As Richard Cyriax noted, [...] "the loss of the expedition probably added much more [...] knowledge than its successful return would have done". At the same time, it largely quelled the Admiralty's appetite for Arctic exploration. There was a gap of many years before the Nares expedition and when Nares declared there was [...] "no thoroughfare" [...] to the North Pole, his words {{marked the end of}} the Royal Navy's historical involvement in Arctic exploration, {{the end of an era}} in which such exploits were widely seen by the British public as worthy expenditures of human effort and monetary resources. As a writer for The Athenaeum put it, [...] "We <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> fairly make out the account between the cost and results of these Arctic Expeditions, and ask whether it is worth while to risk so much for that which is so difficult of attainment, and when attained, is so worthless." [...] The navigation of the Northwest Passage in 1903–05 by Roald Amundsen with the Gjøa expedition effectively ended the centuries-long quest for the Northwest Passage.|$|E

And {{in the period}} of Fukuda ruling, this diplomacy contemporarily withdrew from Japanese diplomatic stage, but its democratic values concept is still displayed in diplomatic activities. After Tarou Asou Taro Aso became the prime minister, what would be the position of values diplomacy in Japanese strategy and national policy? On this issue, it is necessary to have a deep exploring into Japanese values diplomacy. In this text, the author <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> not just regard this kind of diplomacy as an ideological method of blocking Sino-Russian strategic space. It is more {{an important component of the}} comprehensive security cooperation strategy in the 21 st century, and it preoccupies an important status in Japanese national strategy and policy...|$|R
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

According to Richmond, Nate still has plenty more to give and the studio would continue to create new Uncharted experiences as long as fans want it. Speaking to VentureBeat, Richmond pointed out that the studio never set out to make a trilogy. Instead it has always [...] "sort have seen it as a stand-alone adventure", with each game existing as a self-sustaining gaming experience.

2500|$|Kahane {{proposed}} an [...] "exchange of populations" [...] that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: [...] "A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely {{it is time}} for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago." [...] Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who [...] "don't want to leave", and he encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: [...] "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus." ...|$|E

60|$|POWER also {{is another}} of those simple ideas which we receive from {{sensation}} and reflection. For, observing in ourselves <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do and <b>can</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> at pleasure move several parts of our bodies which were at rest; the effects, also, that natural bodies are able to produce in one another, occurring every moment to our senses,--we both these ways get the idea of power.|$|R
2500|$|Drews <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{go farther}} and ascribe {{the change to}} Pope Gelasius I (492-96). A very old {{tradition}} connects his name with at any rate, some important work about the Canon. The second oldest Roman sacramentary known, although it is really later than St. Gregory, {{has been called the}} [...] "Sacramentarium Gelasianum" [...] since the 9th century (Duchesne, Origines, 120). Gennadius I says that he composed a sacramentary (De. vir. ill., c. xciv). Moreover, the Liber Pontificalis refers to his liturgical work (Origines, 122) and the Stowe Missal (7th century) puts {{at the head of the}} Canon the title: [...] "Canon dominicus Papæ Gelasi" [...] (ed. Warren, 234). Baumer has collected all the evidences for Gelasius's authorship of some important sacramentary (Histor. Jahrb., 1893, 244 sqq.). It is known that Gelasius did not compose the text of the Canon. Its component parts have been traced back to a far earlier date. But would not so vital a change in its arrangement best explain the tradition that persistently connects the recent Canon with the name of Gelasius? ...|$|R

Then I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all owe something to Harry, and <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> at least, endeavor {{to carry out his}} wishes.

40|$|Theory of Orrin Klapp {{about social}} types draws {{attention}} to important functions that these types have within certain societies {{as well as that}} it is preferable to take them into consideration if our goal is more complete knowledge of that society. For Klapp, social types are important social symbols, which in an interesting way reflect society they are part of and for that reason this author dedicates his work to considering their meanings and social functions. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> not understand a society without the knowledge about the types with which its members are identified and which serve them as models in their social activity. Hence, these types have cognitive value since, according to Klapp, they assist in perception and "contain the truth", and therefore the knowledge of them allows easier orientation within the social system. Social types also offer insight into the scheme of the social structure, which is otherwise invisible and hidden, but certainly deserves attention if we wish clearer picture about social relations within specific community. The aim of this work is to present this very interesting and inspirative theory of Orrin Klapp, pointing out its importance but also its weaknesses which should be kept in mind during its application in further research...|$|R
