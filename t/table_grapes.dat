5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as <b>table</b> <b>grapes.</b> Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt.|$|E

50|$|The grape was {{originally}} bred to be a <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> variety but {{fell out of}} favor for <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> growers due to how quickly the freshly picked grapes spoiled and the tendency of berries to fall off the stem in transit.|$|R
25|$|Seedlessness is an {{important}} feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of seedless fruits. Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially grapefruit, mandarin oranges, navel oranges), satsumas, <b>table</b> <b>grapes,</b> and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness {{is the result of}} parthenocarpy, where fruits set without fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit set may or may not require pollination, but most seedless citrus fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit.|$|E
25|$|The Muscat {{family of}} grapes include over 200 grape {{varieties}} {{belonging to the}} Vitis vinifera species {{that have been used}} in wine production and as raisin and <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> around the globe for many centuries. Their colors range from white (such as Muscat Ottonel), to yellow (Moscato Giallo), to pink (Moscato rosa del Trentino) to near black (Muscat Hamburg). Muscat grapes and wines almost always have a pronounced sweet floral aroma. The breadth and number of varieties of Muscat suggest that it is perhaps the oldest domesticated grape variety, and there are theories that most families within the Vitis vinifera grape variety are descended from the Muscat variety.|$|E
25|$|When Filipino American {{farm workers}} {{initiated}} the Delano grape strike on September 8, 1965, to protest for higher wages, Chavez eagerly supported them. Six months later, Chavez and the NFWA led a strike of California grape pickers on the historic farmworkers march from Delano to the California state capitol in Sacramento for similar goals. The UFW encouraged all Americans to boycott <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> {{as a show}} of support. The strike lasted five years and attracted national attention. In March 1966, the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held hearings in California on the strike. During the hearings, subcommittee member Robert F.

25|$|Other {{agricultural}} products cultivated in the Coachella Valley include fruits and vegetables, especially <b>table</b> <b>grapes,</b> citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit; onions and leeks; and peppers. The valley floor served to grow bounties of alfalfa, artichokes, avocados, beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, corn, cotton, cucumbers, dandelions (salad greens), eggplant, figs, grains (i.e. barley, oats, rye and wheat; plus rice fields kept wet or moist in the Salton Sea area), hops, kohlrabi, lettuce, mangoes, nectarines and peaches, persimmons, plums and prunes, pomegranate, potatoes, radishes, spinach, strawberries, sugar cane, tomatoes, {{a variety of}} herbs and spices, and other vegetable crops. The Coachella grapefruit originated in the region. The city of Coachella is the primary shipping point for agricultural goods. Domesticated grasses, flowers and trees are widely grown for warm-weather or desert climates, and sold for use in golf courses and landscape.|$|E
25|$|The first {{vineyard}} {{planted in}} the Okanagan was at the Oblate Mission in Kelowna in 1859, planted by French Catholic priest Charles Pandosy and was solely intended {{for the production of}} sacramental wine for the celebration of the Eucharist. Several small vineyards, planted mostly with Vitis labrusca sprang up until prohibition encouraged the uprooting and replanting with other agricultural crops. For most of the 20th century after prohibition, what limited wine production {{that took place in the}} Okanagan was mostly fruit wines made from berries, apples, cherries or even <b>table</b> <b>grapes.</b> One winery, Calona Wines founded in 1932, still remains from that period and was the first commercial winery in British Columbia and remains the oldest continuously running winery in the province. Eventually the use of French-American hybrid grapes, such as Marechal Foch and Vidal blanc took hold, led by the Stewarts of Quails' Gate Estate Winery.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, the South African wine {{industry}} received minimal international attention. Its isolation was exacerbated by the boycotts of South African products in protest against the country's system of Apartheid. It {{was not until the}} late 1980s and 1990s when Apartheid was ended, and the world's export market opened up, that South African wines began to experience a renaissance. Many producers in South Africa quickly adopted new viticultural and winemaking technologies. The presence of flying winemakers from abroad brought international influences and focus on well-known varieties such as Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. The reorganisation of the powerful KWV co-operative into a private business sparked further innovation and improvement in quality. Vineyard owners and wineries who had previously relied on the price-fixing structure that bought their excess grapes for distillation were forced to become more competitive by shifting their focus to the production of quality wine. In 1990, less than 30% of all the grapes harvested were used for wine production meant for the consumer market with the remaining 70% being discarded, distilled into brandy, or sold as <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> and juice. By 2003, the numbers had been reversed with more than 70% of the grapes harvested that year reaching the consumer market as wine.|$|E

25|$|Medina {{began working}} {{full-time}} for the UFW in 1966. He worked in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, helping {{to ensure that}} non-union grapes were not shipped overseas and that wine made from non-union grapes was not sold in stores. He worked closely with Dolores Huerta, and was jailed. In the fall of 1967, César Chávez sent him to Chicago, Illinois, to launch the Midwestern segment of the national boycott that formed {{the second part of}} the Delano grape strike. He was so shy that he often could not speak during interviews or press conferences, but he built one of the most successful boycott operations in the country, which ultimately helped force the growers to sign historic contracts in 1970. While in Chicago, he also raised several thousand dollars for the UFW. In January 1968, Medina crossed the nation with a school bus of farmworkers to build support in the Northeast for a secondary boycott of products made from Delano grapes. He concluded that Ross' organizing techniques did not translate well into urban areas and to secondary boycotts, and he began developing his own techniques and ideas about building support among non-farmworkers based on his Chicago experiences. Medina returned to the Midwest, and began holding sit-ins in supermarket chains to publicize the farmworkers' plight, encourage consumers to stop eating <b>table</b> <b>grapes,</b> and pressure stores to stop carrying the produce. Many supermarket chains stopped selling grapes. He won widespread praise for his Midwest campaign.|$|E
40|$|<b>Table</b> <b>grape</b> cv 'Red Globe' is {{produced}} in Sicily and {{in other areas of}} Southern Italy. This produce is very appreciated by consumers, having the best rankings in the world market for exports and quality. Nevertheless, despite it is a non-climacteric fruit, <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> is very perishable, both after harvest, and during postharvest handling and cold storage. In fact, also at low temperatures, <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> is very sensitive to fungal infection (Botrytis cinerea) and other diseases, like gray mold, which is very aggressive. For this reason, a standard practice is to fumigate <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> with sulphur dioxide (SO 2), after storage in chambers. The growing market request of <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> cv. 'Red Globe' enhanced postharvest research on better techniques aimed to maintain the grapes for longer periods, in order to satisfy the demand. Therefore, the object {{of this study is to}} assess the effect of cold storage, at 1 ± 0. 5 °C and 93 ± 2 % relative humidity (RH), of <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> cv 'Red Globe', for 4 months, with low concentrations of SO 2 (0. 20 %), with the aim to extend their post-harvest shelf life. Two samples of Red Globe <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> were stored at 1 ± 0. 5 °C, the first for control without SO 2, and the other treated with low concentration of SO 2. Both samples were moved every 15 days, to 20 °C for 3 days, for simulating shelf life and berry decay. Results showed that, 'Red Globe' <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> treated with low concentration of SO 2, prolonged its shelf life for three months after harvest. More particularly, firmness, weight loss, total soluble solids content and titratable acidity maintained good values, and rachis and berry decay were inhibited. This technique is a good alternative to the SO 2 one or dual release generating pads for maintaining grape quality in extended storage, with lower impacts for the environment and lower costs...|$|R

2500|$|Commercially {{cultivated}} grapes {{can usually}} be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (<b>table</b> <b>grapes)</b> or used to make wine (wine grapes). While {{almost all of them}} belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. Table grape cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight.
