25|$|WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina (a {{station that}} re-joined NBC in February 2016) is {{currently}} testing the upcoming ATSC 3.0 <b>television</b> <b>standard,</b> {{which will allow}} the transmission of 2160p ultra-high-definition television (UHD), through a secondary experimental station (WRAL-EX); it has transmitted limited NBC programming in UHD through a secondary subchannel, and is currently the only station overall which transmits NBC's schedule in 1080p on its main subchannel.|$|E
25|$|The nominal 1.5Gbit/s {{interfaces}} support most high-definition video formats. Supported formats include 1080/60i, 1080/59.94i, 1080/50i, 1080/30p, 1080/29.97p, 1080/25p, 1080/24p, 1080/23.98p, 720/60p, 720/59.94p, and 720/50p. In addition, {{there are}} several 1035i formats (an obsolete Japanese <b>television</b> <b>standard),</b> half-bandwidth 720p standards such as 720/24p (used in some film conversion applications, and unusual because it has an odd number of samples per line), and various 1080psf (progressive, segmented frame) formats. Progressive Segmented frames formats appear as interlace video but contain video which is progressively scanned. This is done to support analog monitors and televisions, {{many of which are}} incapable of locking to low field rates such as 30Hz and 24Hz.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, René Barthélemy {{developed}} an 819-line <b>television</b> <b>standard.</b> During {{the years of}} occupation, Barthélemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the liberation of Paris. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, François Mitterrand decreed a broadcast standard of 819 lines; broadcasting began {{at the end of}} 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7MHz.|$|E

2500|$|A {{few years}} later , the FCC held {{hearings}} to address early cross-ownership issues; specifically, whether newspaper companies owning radio stations was in the public interest. These [...] "newspaper divorcement hearings" [...] were held between 1941 and 1944, though it appears that these hearings were geared mostly towards discussion by industry stakeholders. Around the same time, the Commission held hearings {{as a part of}} its evaluation of the national <b>television</b> <b>standard,</b> and in 1958 held additional hearings on the television network broadcasting rules. Though public hearings were organized somewhat infrequently, there was an obvious public appeal. In his now famous [...] "vast wasteland" [...] speech in 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow noted that the commission would hold a [...] "well advertised public hearing" [...] in each community to assure broadcasters were serving the public interest, clearly a move to reconnect the Commission with the public interest (at least rhetorically).|$|E
