Władysław's death {{marked the end}} of relative stability in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as conflicts and <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> had been growing over several decades came to a head with devastating consequences, notably the largest of the Cossack uprisings – the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648) – and the Swedish invasion ("the Deluge", 1655–60).|$|E
5|$|In The Artist Among the Missing (1949), Manning {{illustrates}} the racial <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind {{in which the}} British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The School for Love (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment {{in a city that}} is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.|$|E

During the lock-out, team owner {{and chairman of the}} board, Harley Hotchkiss, attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden. While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
5|$|The Hockey Sweater is Carrier's {{most famous}} work and is {{considered}} an iconic piece of Canadian literature. The story has sold over 300,000 copies and has been republished in numerous anthologies. It exemplifies the nation's passion for hockey, {{and while it is}} often considered an allegory of the relationship and <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> exist between francophones and anglophones, the story is popular throughout the entire nation. A line from the story appears on Canadian five-dollar bills printed between 2001 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room {{had to be made}} for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, {{the pursuit of}} {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions and was often used to attach superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661–62, which involved 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. There may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> contributed to accusations may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{previous}} volume, Explorers on the Moon, The Calculus Affair was created {{with the aid}} of the Hergé's team of artists at Studios Hergé. The story reflected the Cold War <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> Europe was experiencing during the 1950s, and introduced three recurring characters into the series: Jolyon Wagg, Cutts the Butcher, and Colonel Sponsz. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Red Sea Sharks, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Calculus Affair was critically well-received, with various commentators having described it {{as one of the best}} Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king, Edward I {{rebuilt the}} status of the monarchy, restoring and extending key castles that had fallen into disrepair. Uprisings by the princes of North Wales led to Edward mobilising a huge army, defeating the native Welsh and undertaking a programme of English colonisation and castle building across the region. Further wars were conducted in Flanders and Aquitaine. Edward also fought campaigns in Scotland, but was unable to achieve strategic victory, and the costs created <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> nearly led to civil war. Edward II inherited the war with Scotland and faced growing opposition to his rule {{as a result of his}} royal favourites and military failures. The Despenser War of 1321–22 was followed by instability and the subsequent overthrow, and possible murder, of Edward in 1327 at the hands of his French wife, Isabella, and a rebel baron, Roger Mortimer. Isabella and Mortimer's regime lasted only a few years before falling to a coup, led by Isabella's son Edward III, in 1330.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were more tightly {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. There {{may also have been}} a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused ethnic <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{escalated}} between foreign traders on Samoa and {{the local}} populace, {{due in part to}} controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American biologist doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> he sent a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the copra crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by California representative Julius Kahn and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire {{had been}} in {{transition}} since the 1920s, and the pace accelerated {{in the wake of}} the Second World War. More and more member states demanded independence, and a series of crises erupted during the 1950s, including the 1952 Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya and the Suez Crisis of 1956. During the same period immigration into Britain from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean was on the increase, causing some resentment among elements of the native population. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts black communities in Nottingham and London came under attack from mobs of white Britons; Kneale became keen to develop the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> culminated in the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.|$|E

5|$|The first ship of the class, Reşadiye, {{was ordered}} on 8 June 1911. Work stopped in 1912 {{following}} {{the start of}} the First Balkan War due to the probability that the Ottoman government would run out of funds. Work resumed in May 1913 following the conclusion of the conflict. The second ship, Fatih Sultan Mehmed, was ordered on 29 April 1914 in response to the Greek order for Vasilefs Konstantinos in early 1914. The British government ordered work to stop in late July 1914, {{as a result of the}} growing <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> culminated in the outbreak of World War I on the 28th; what material that had been assembled was dismantled on the slipway in August.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors, and blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social <b>tensions</b> <b>that</b> erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E
