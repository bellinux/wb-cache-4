It went on to sell about 8 million copies in the U.S. and 12 million copies worldwide. During 1998 and 1999, Hill earned $25million from record sales and touring. Hill, along with Blige, Missy Elliott, Meshell Ndegeocello, Erykah Badu, and others, found a feminist voice with the neo soul genre.|$|E

In addition to Miseducation works, the nominations included her rendition of [...] "Can't <b>Take</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> Off You" [...] for the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory, which had appeared on Billboard charts, and Hill's writing and producing of [...] "A Rose Is Still a Rose", which became a late-in-career hit for Aretha Franklin. She appeared on several magazine covers, including Time, Esquire, Rolling Stone, Teen People and The New York Times Fashion Magazine. During the ceremony, Hill broke another record by becoming the first woman to win five times in one night, taking home the awards for Album of the Year, Best R Album, Best R Song, Best Female R Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist. During an acceptance speech, she said, [...] "This is crazy. This is hip-hop!" [...] Hill had brought forth a new, mainstream acceptance of the genre.|$|E

500|$|Veronica Mars {{was also}} {{positively}} received by other writers.

Seriously, I've never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn't making, and maybe even more than those [...] These guys know what they're doing on a level that intimidates me. It's the Harry Potter of shows." [...] Kevin Smith, who guest starred in the episode [...] "Driver Ed", said that Veronica Mars was [...] "hands-down, the best show on television right now, and proof that TV can be far better than cinema." [...] Stephen King described the series as [...] "Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is Veronica Mars so good? It bears little resemblance to life as I know it, but I can't <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> off the damn thing."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} at every {{show on the}} 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour. Concerts from this tour were elaborate multimedia spectacles that Bono performed as a variety of characters, but {{for the end of}} the main set, the group reverted to playing classics, including [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", straight. Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree photo shoot. The video was speeded up for humorous effect—NME described the effect as giving it a [...] "silly, Charlie Chaplin quality"—and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens. This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360° Tour. Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys' synthpop cover of the song (titled [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can't <b>Take</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> off You)"). Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys' interpretation. Critics welcomed the song in the group's set list: The Independent said the song [...] "induces instant euphoria, as U2 do what they're best at, slipping into epic rock mode, playing music made for the arena". In two other local newspaper reviews, critics praised the song's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits.|$|E
500|$|Like other teams, {{the team}} also {{have a history of}} {{adopting}} or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events, themes, players or personas. These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as [...] "The Bells are Ringing," [...] along with more pun-laden or humorous efforts, such as chanting former player Paolo Di Canio's name to the canzone [...] "La donna è mobile" [...] by Giuseppe Verdi, or D.I. Canio to the tune of Ottawan's [...] "D.I.S.C.O.", or the chant of [...] "Who Let The Potts Out?" [...] to the tune of Baha Men's [...] "Who Let the Dogs Out?" [...] when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or [...] "That's Zamora" [...] to the tune of Dean Martin's 1953 [...] "That's Amore" [...] in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora. Other former players to be serenaded include Christian Dailly with vastly-altered lyrics to Frankie Valli's [...] "Can't <b>Take</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> Off You", Joe Cole and Carlton Cole with Spandau Ballet's [...] "Gold" [...] song title sung as [...] "Cole" [...] and Luděk Mikloško. A song for West Ham favourite Bobby Moore, [...] "Viva Bobby Moore", is also sung based on The Business's [...] "Oi!" [...] rendition of the song, based on The Equals' 1969 release [...] "Viva Bobby Joe".

2500|$|In 1989, Jobs {{first met}} his future wife, Laurene Powell, when [...] {{he gave a}} lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene [...] "was {{right there in the}} front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy." [...] After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, {{for the rest of his}} life. Powell's father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she {{received}} her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports. She also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did and was more of a private than public person. Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with [...] "a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers." [...] They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. Fifty people, including his father, Paul, and his sister, Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs's guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike (during which Laurene's brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: [...] "You see, Mona , Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John Muir." ...|$|E
