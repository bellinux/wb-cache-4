25|$|The {{doctrine}} {{in the criminal}} field that the Government can invoke its evidence privileges only {{at the price of}} letting the defendant go free has no application in a civil forum, where <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the moving party, but is a defendant only on terms to which it has consented.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{majority}} of the school buildings are above their standards, <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> responsible for the school's maintenance. Replacements of plant and machinery as well as the upkeeping of existing facilities require substantial sums of money. The Brothers, Principal Brother Francis, and some old boys initiated the idea of a foundation whose sole aim was to provide sufficient funds to do this. In early 1992, the La Salle Foundation was established with Michael Sze as the first chairman.|$|E
25|$|All {{circulating}} notes, {{issued from}} 1861 to present, {{will be honored}} by the government at face value as legal tender.

25|$|The Flemish {{government}} {{sees this}} as a worrying trend, and enacted policies designed to keep the periphery of Brussels Dutch-speaking. One effect of this policy was a very literal interpretation of the linguistic facility laws, including the Peeters directive. This circulaire stipulates, among other things, that when French-speakers in those six Municipalities with language facilities deal with the government, they can request a French version of documents or publications but need to do so every time they want one; <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> allowed to register their preference.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the same}} {{application}} of vertical transactions MMT {{argues that the}} holder of the bond is irrelevant to the issuing government. As {{long as there is}} a demand for the issuer's currency, whether the bond holder is foreign or not, governments can never be insolvent when the debt obligations are in their own currency; this is because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> constrained in creating its own currency (although the bond holder may affect the exchange rate by converting to local currency). Similarly, according to the FX theory outlined above, the currency paid out at maturity cannot leave the country of issuance either.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of the Comorian franc is founded on tight monetary and credit discipline, underpinned by two specific safeguard measures: the central bank is required to maintain 20% foreign-exchange cover of its sight liabilities, and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> allowed to draw more than 20% of the previous year's budget receipts from their central bank funds. The ministers of finance of the franc area (France, the CFA zone and Comoros) meet biannually.

It is a continuation of a relationship of monetary cooperation between the two countries that has existed for more than a century.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{believed}} the Court's holding in Dusenbery that actual notice {{is not required}} implied that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> required to take additional steps when it becomes aware that its attempt at notice has failed. He accordingly characterized the Court's ruling as [...] "little more than a thinly veiled attack on Dusenbery." [...] Thomas stated that the majority's logic would require a State to consider additional means every time a doubt is raised as to whether notice has been achieved, imposing a requirement with [...] "no natural end point" [...] that Thomas thought effectively required [...] "something close to actual notice." ...|$|E

[...] Labelling Gordon Brown's tactic a [...] "scorched-earth policy" [...] that a future Conservative government would have to clear up, Osborne continued: [...] "His view is he probably won't win the next election.

Alkatiri said that he would only resign if his party Fretilin wanted him to, and on 25 June, a meeting of Fretilin leaders confirmed Alkatiri's status as Prime Minister. In response, Foreign and Defence Minister José Ramos-Horta resigned from office [...] "because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> functioning properly", according to his spokesperson.|$|E

The government has claimed that the actions of the activists are within freedom of expression, and has appealed to the activists not to commit provocations towards North Korea. Chairman Kim Moo-sung of the Saenuri Party was concerned that hardline anti-North Korea activists might not be helping inter-Korean relations, after a balloon launch provoked a shoot-out across the Korean Demilitarized Zone on 10 October 2014. As a response to the criticism that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> doing enough to stop the balloon launches, president Park Geun-hye said that the issue would be [...] "dealt with in a way that considers both freedom of expression and the safety of local residents".|$|E
