30|$|The {{solution}} to the inter-cluster duplicate coverage problem necessitates the neighbor clusters to exchange their CSP values, member list, <b>target</b> <b>IDs</b> covered by the members, and their TCP values. Following the same procedure used in the intra-cluster duplicate coverage problem, each CH determines the sensor nodes that can go to sleep mode and ignores sending data for a specific target. If the TCP values of the member nodes in different clusters, which have duplicate coverage, are the same, then the conflict resolution works as follows: the CH having a lower CSP value performs the further actions. Thus, our proposed TCDC system would save {{a significant amount of}} energy and network bandwidth wastage through lightweight improvements.|$|R

50|$|Host-based zoning {{is usually}} {{referred}} to as persistent binding or LUN, and is perhaps the least implemented form of zoning. Because it requires the host configuration to be correct {{in order to avoid}} zoning conflicts, this form of zoning creates a greater opportunity for administrative errors and conflicting access to targets. Moreover zoning interfaces vary among different host operating systems and HBA's — increasing the possibility for administrative errors. If a host is not configured with the zoning software, it can access all devices in the fabric and create an even higher probability of data corruption. Host-based zoning is often used when clusters are implemented to control the mapping of devices to specific <b>target</b> <b>IDs.</b> However, it should never be the only form of zoning. Augmenting host-based zoning with storage- and fabric-based zoning is the only acceptable method to reliably control device access and data security.|$|R

3000|$|To {{estimate}} empirical discriminability (i.e., {{to measure}} the ability of participants to correctly sort innocent and guilty suspects into their true categories), an area under the curve measure is computed. As noted above, lineup ROCs are usually based only on positive <b>IDs</b> (positive <b>Target</b> <b>IDs</b> from target-present lineups and positive foil IDs from target-absent lineups), which yields a truncated, partial ROC compared to the ROCs obtained from non-lineup tasks. In non-lineup tasks, the FAR typically ranges from 0 to 1, but in a fair lineup ROC, it only ranges from 0 to 1 / 6 (. 167). That is the maximum possible FAR because even if every witness presented with a fair target-absent lineup identified someone (i.e., if responding were maximally liberal such that a “yes” response were made to every target-absent lineup), witnesses would land on the innocent suspect by chance only 1 / 6 {{of the time and}} would land on a filler the other 5 / 6 of the time. In actual practice, the obtained FAR is typically much less than [...]. 167 (as it is in Fig. 4) because, typically, responding is not maximally liberal.|$|R
40|$|Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) act in cell type- and gene-specific manner through {{interactions}} with coregulatory proteins to regulate numerous physiological and pathological processes {{at the level}} of gene regulation. Binding of steroid receptor modulator (SRM) ligand leads to allosteric changes in SHR to exert positive or negative effects on the expression of target genes. Due, in part, to the fact that current SRMs generally target ligand binding domain (LBD) /AF 2 and neglect intrinsically disordered (ID) N-terminal domain (NTD) /AF 1, clinically relevant SRMs lack selectivity and are also prone to the development of resistance over time. Therefore, to maximize the efficacy of SHR-based therapeutics, the possibility of developing unique modulators that act to control AF 1 activity must be considered. Recent studies targeting androgen receptor′s (AR′s) ID AF 1 domain for the castration-resistant prostate cancer has provided the possibility of therapeutically <b>targeting</b> <b>ID</b> NTD/AF 1 surfaces by allosteric modulations to achieve desired effects. In this review article, we discuss how inter- and intra- molecular allosteric regulations controlled by AR′s structural flexibility and dynamics particularly the ID NTD/AF 1 is an emerging area of investigation, which could be exploited for drug development and therapeutic targeting of prostate cancer...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{discipline}} of Combat ID, as related to high performance fighters, a problem of significant proportion that arises is how to determine quickly and accurately a <b>target’s</b> <b>ID.</b> Various algorithms, {{many of which are}} proprietary, that address this problem have been developed over the last decade. But their robustness in handling a new and unforeseen target threat environment leaves much to be desired. In this paper we explore two candidate classes of algorithms for achieving this objective, namely, an evidential reasoning and a cumulative scoring technique. We present the results via a comparative analysis where we look at the problem not only from a timeliness and accuracy of identification perspective, but also {{from the point of view}} of computational throughput. The analysis is based on simulation results using the sensor fusion system of a high performance fighter program. This system accomplishes the fusion of attribute data from a diverse set of sensors in a real time, computationally constrained processing environment. We will show some of the performance advantages evidential reasoning exhibits over a cumulative scoring approach. This is demonstrated on a typical scenario that the fighter in question has to show performance against. Furthermore, we will discuss a methodology for usin...|$|R
40|$|Person re-identification (re-ID) models {{trained on}} one domain {{often fail to}} generalize well to another. In our attempt, we present a "learning via translation" framework. In the baseline, we {{translate}} the labeled images from source to target domain in an unsupervised manner. We then train re-ID models with the translated images by supervised methods. Yet, being {{an essential part of}} this framework, unsupervised image-image translation suffers from the information loss of source-domain labels during translation. Our motivation is two-fold. First, for each image, the discriminative cues contained in its ID label should be maintained after translation. Second, given the fact that two domains have entirely different persons, a translated image should be dissimilar to any of the <b>target</b> <b>IDs.</b> To this end, we propose to preserve two types of unsupervised similarities, 1) self-similarity of an image before and after translation, and 2) domain-dissimilarity of a translated source image and a target image. Both constraints are implemented in the similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) which consists of a Siamese network and a CycleGAN. Through domain adaptation experiment, we show that images generated by SPGAN are more suitable for domain adaptation and yield consistent and competitive re-ID accuracy on two large-scale datasets.

40|$|Surveillance systems {{typically}} perform target identification by fusing <b>target</b> <b>ID</b> declarations {{supplied by}} individual sensors with a prior knowledge-base. <b>Target</b> <b>ID</b> declarations are usually uncertain {{in the sense}} that: (1) their associated confidence factor is less than unity; (2) they are non-specific (the true hypothesis belongs to a subset A of the universe ⊙). Prior knowledge is typically represented {{by a set of}} possibly uncertain implication rules. An example of such a rule is: if the target is Boeing 737 than it is neutral or friendly with probability 0. 8. The uncertainty again manifests itself here in two ways: the rule holds only with a certain probability (typically less than 1. 0) and the rule is non-specific (neutral or friendly). The paper describes how the fusion of ID declarations and the implication rules can be handled elegantly {{within the framework of the}} belief function theory as understood by the transferable belief model (TBM). Two illustrative examples are worked out in details in order to clarify the theory. SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Diffuse {{intrinsic}} pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal {{brain cancer}} that arises in the brainstem of children, with no effective treatment and near 100 % fatality. The failure of most therapies {{can be attributed}} to the delicate location of these tumors and to the selection of therapies on the basis of assumptions that DIPGs are molecularly similar to adult disease.

40|$|Sequential Monte Carlo {{methods have}} {{attracted}} the attention of the tracking community as a solution to Bayesian estimation particularly for nonlinear problems. Several attributes of particle filters support their use in jointly tracking and identifying ground targets in a road-constrained network. First, since the target dynamics are simulated, propagating a target within a constrained state space is handled quite naturally since the particle filter is not restricted to propagating Gaussian PDFs. Furthermore, a particle filter can approximate the PDF of a mixture of continuous random variables (the target kinematic state) and discrete random variables (the <b>target</b> <b>ID)</b> which is necessary for the joint tracking and identification problem. Given HRRGMTI measurements of a target, we propose to jointly estimate a target’s kinematic state and identification by propagating the joint PDF of the target kinematic state (position and velocity) and <b>target</b> <b>ID.</b> In this way, we capitalize on the inherent coupling between the target’s feature measurement (the HRR profile) and the target’s kinematic state. In addition to the coupling between a target’s feature measurement and the target’s kinematic state, there exists a coupling between a target’s dynamics and the target’s ID which can also be exploited through particle filtering methods. We develop the particle filtering algorithm for tracking and identifying ground targets in a road-constrained environment and present simulation results for a two-class problem...|$|E
