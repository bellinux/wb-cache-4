5|$|<b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> {{called for}} 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be {{defeated}} in Kingston, his supporters {{tried to get}} him to run in the safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35years, he stood there again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> to be held on 21 October.

Cordray was the first Democrat to hold the position since 1977, and he assumed office on December 9, 2002, instead of after January 1 because he was filling Hall's unexpired term.|$|E
5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. <b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the {{responsibility}} of selecting a successor.

5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails.

The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E
