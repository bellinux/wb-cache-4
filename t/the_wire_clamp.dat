40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanism and robust {{control of a}} monolithic wire clamp to achieve fast and precision operations for strong and robust micro device packaging. <b>The</b> <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> is piezoelectrically actuated and a two-stage flexure-based amplification was designed to obtain large and parallel jaw displacements. The grasping forces of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> were evaluated based on finite element analysis (FEA), and the force measurement was presented. <b>The</b> <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> was manufactured using wire EDM technique and the position and force transfer functions were obtained based on the frequency response approach. The position/force switching control strategy was employed to regulate the motion position and grasping force, and the position/force switching controller composed of a PID controller for position control and a sliding model controller (SMC) for force control was designed. Experimental tests were carried out to investigate the performance of wire clamp with the position/force switching controller during the grasping and releasing operations. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>clamp</b> exhibits good performance and demonstrate that high speed and precision grasping operations can be realized through the developed wire clamp and the control strategy. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that <b>clamping</b> a tensioned <b>wire</b> {{can cause a}} reduction in wire tension. Tension (about 1275 N) was applied to a wire that was subsequently clamped, using cannulated bolts, to the steel half-ring of an Ilizarov external fixator. The tension in <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> caused by <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was <b>clamped</b> to <b>the</b> frame, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> tension was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). <b>The</b> drop in <b>wire</b> tension was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (tensioned), and the clamping effect replicated. This analysis showed that <b>clamping</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> could be considered to squeeze <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> outwards (like toothpaste from a tube) and so reduce its tension during fixator assembly. To assess {{the magnitude of this}} effect in the clinical situation, the FE model analysis was repeated to replicate clamping a 1. 8 -mm-diameter wire to a 180 -mm-diameter steel Ilizarov ring component. The analysis showed that for these conditions the tension reduced by 8 - 29 per cent. The results of this study highlight a general engineering problem: how can a tensioned wire be secured to a structure without an appreciable loss of tension? If the performance of the structure depends on <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> tension, this performance will change when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> is secured...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be <b>wire</b> <b>clamps.</b> An obvious design would seem to be simply having a <b>wire</b> around <b>the</b> hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the clamped-wire system used to suspend bones within an Ilizarov external fixator yields when the perpendicular load exceeds 50 N per wire. Cyclic loading was applied to tensioned <b>wires</b> <b>clamped</b> within an Ilizarov ring component, with steadily increasing load amplitude. Wires were tested at four initial tension settings. The amount of energy lost within the clamped-wire system per load cycle was calculated for every test. The results showed {{that there was a}} consistent trend to increasing non-recoverable energy loss per load cycle when peak loads exceed 50 N for all initial tension settings. A finite element (FE) model replicating the experimental conditions was performed to investigate the levels of stress within <b>the</b> loaded <b>wires.</b> <b>The</b> FE model analyses showed that high stresses were generated in <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> close to <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> sites, and that the stress levels could reasonably be expected to exceed the material yield stress when loaded to about 55 N, for all initial tension settings. The results show that material yield, accompanied by some <b>wire</b> slippage through <b>the</b> <b>clamps,</b> is responsible for system yield, in agreement with previous studies. Although <b>the</b> initial <b>wire</b> tension has an appreciable effect on <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> stiffness, it did not affect the elastic load range of the clamped-wire system. To prevent yield of the clamped-wire system in practice, the fixator should be assembled with sufficient wires to ensure that the load transmitted to each <b>wire</b> by <b>the</b> patient does not exceed 50 N...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{high-speed}} and medium-speed wire {{electrical discharge machines}} {{which are}} originally developed in China are playing {{an important role in}} mold making. However, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode wear is a universal problem in the machining process because <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode is used repeatedly. Considering the relative motion between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode and <b>the</b> workpiece, the heat transfer model of wire electrode under moving heat source was established, and the temperature field of wire electrode was simulated in single pulse discharge by FEM. The results indicated that the size of the melted zone along <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode axial direction increased remarkably while the depth size, the width size and the volume of the melted zone reduced apparently when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> running speed increased. It can be concluded that the high relative speed between <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode and <b>the</b> workpiece is beneficial to reduce <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode wear in radial direction. Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> running speed is higher than a certain value, the discharge column will slide over <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode surface before <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> material reaches its melting point, thus the melting and ablation of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> electrode material does not happen, which can almost realize no wire electrode wear...|$|R

50|$|For example, if two <b>wires</b> {{carrying}} <b>the</b> same {{alternating current}} lie parallel to one another, {{as would be}} found in a coil used in an inductor or transformer, the magnetic field of one wire will induce longitudinal eddy currents in <b>the</b> adjacent <b>wire,</b> that flow in long loops along <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> in <b>the</b> same direction as the main current on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> facing away from <b>the</b> other <b>wire,</b> and back in the opposite direction on the side of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> facing <b>the</b> other <b>wire.</b> Thus <b>the</b> eddy current will reinforce the main current on the side facing away from <b>the</b> first <b>wire,</b> and oppose <b>the</b> main current on the side facing <b>the</b> first <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> net effect is to redistribute the current in the cross section of <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> into a thin strip on the side facing away from <b>the</b> other <b>wire.</b> Since <b>the</b> current is concentrated into a smaller area of <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> resistance is increased.|$|R

50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of <b>the</b> hot <b>wire</b> mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of <b>the</b> hot <b>wire</b> anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a <b>wire</b> suspended in <b>the</b> engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> or a constant current through <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>wire's</b> electrical resistance increases as <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, <b>the</b> <b>wire’s</b> temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again.
