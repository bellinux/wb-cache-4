40|$|This study {{examines}} the behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) columns strengthened {{with either a}} RC jacket or an additional RC layer. The main object of this work was to evaluate the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> specimens for different connection procedures used to bond {{the old and new}} concrete. For <b>the</b> column <b>strengthened</b> with a concrete jacket, the effect of the roughness of the interface on the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> specimen was examined. For <b>the</b> column <b>strengthened</b> using an additional RC layer, the presence of shear connectors between the old and new reinforcement was also examined to provide adequate connection between the two concrete members. The strength degradation of the interface because of the cyclic loading was taken into account.

40|$|Cracked {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) beams can be repaired effectively by using externally bonded CFRP sheets. However, when <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> beams {{are subjected to}} marine environment, long-term performance {{will be affected by}} the material and the interface deterioration of concrete and CFRP. Therefore, to evaluate the service life of <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> beams, this study investigates the behavior of precracked RC beams strengthened with CFRP sheets exposed to marine environment. Accelerated ageing experiments were carried out by exposing specimens to cyclic wetting in sea water and drying in 40 °C air for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. After the environment exposure, four-point bending test was conducted and then the diffusion of chlorides in <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> beams was analysed. The results show that the bonding behavior of the adhesive was weakened and the ductility of <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> beams was slightly reduced due to the marine environment. But there is no obvious strength difference between <b>the</b> <b>strengthened</b> beams suffered from marine environment for 3 months and 6 months. Besides, the precracks in the RC beams accelerated the chloride diffusion, while CFRP bonding reduced the chloride penetration. In addition, NEL method was employed to validate the effect of the cracks on chloride permeability. The results showed that the chloride diffusion coefficients increased with the depth of the cracks...|$|R

The hurricane caused one indirect death and $228,500 in total damages across its path.|$|E
