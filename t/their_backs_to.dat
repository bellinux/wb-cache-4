5|$|When the guecha warriors fought {{battles with}} {{neighbouring}} groups, {{most notably the}} Panche, and also against the Spanish conquistadors, they carried the mummies of their ancestors on <b>their</b> <b>backs,</b> <b>to</b> impress the enemy and receive fortune in battle.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear {{to assist the}} rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture the bridges intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut {{off from the rest of}} the Allied armies with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> the two waterways. If the Germans retained control over the bridges, they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|While Wellesley was {{preoccupied with}} re-taking the gun line, Pohlmann rallied his {{infantry}} and redeployed {{them into a}} semicircle with <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> the Juah; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye. However, most of the Maratha cannon, which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley's infantry, had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield. Reluctant to join the fray, the Maratha cavalry lingered in {{the distance to the}} west. Most were Pindarries: loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose traditional role was to cut down fleeing enemy troops, harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory. They were not trained to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and did not play a further part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Ukuku: {{clad in a}} dark {{coat and}} a woolen mask, the ukukus (spectacled bear) {{represent}} the role of tricksters; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims. Some also {{go up to the}} glacier to spend the night. They cut blocks of glacier ice and carry them on <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> their people at the festival in the valley. When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E

5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn <b>their</b> <b>backs</b> <b>to</b> prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

Later that day, 14 June 1982, General Menéndez surrendered all Argentinian forces. The cost to the two battalions was 40 dead and 93 wounded.|$|E
