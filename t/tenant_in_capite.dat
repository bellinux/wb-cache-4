50|$|The tenants were termed mesne lords, {{with regard}} to those holding from them, the {{immediate}} tenant being <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> <b>capite.</b> The lowest tenant {{of all was the}} freeholder, or, as he was sometimes termed tenant paravail. The Crown, who in theory owned all lands, was lord paramount.|$|E
25|$|In England in the 12th and 13th Centuries, {{the legal}} {{ownership}} of land was defined through a hierarchical system of estates. The monarch {{was the ultimate}} owner of all land in the realm, {{and out of his}} estate lesser estates existed, held by individuals known as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>capite.</b> Further estates could be created out of these estates in a process called subinfeudation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} Statute Quia Emptores is obvious. By declaring that every freeman might sell his lands {{at his own}} pleasure, it removed the feudal {{restraint}} which prevented the tenant from selling his land without the license of his grantor, who was his feudal lord. Hence {{by virtue of the}} Statute, passed in 1290, subinfeudation was abolished and all persons except the King's <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>capite</b> were left at liberty to alien all or any part of their lands at their own pleasure and discretion. Quia Emptores is by express wording, extended only to the lands held in fee simple. Included in its applications, however are leases in fee and fee farmlands. Property in the U. S., with few exceptions, is allodial. This is by virtue of state constitutional provisions, organic territorial acts incorporated into legal systems of states subsequently organized, statutes and decisions of the courts. They are subject to escheat only in the event of failure of successors in ownership.|$|R
60|$|There {{were few}} of the English who in the late {{disturbances}} had not either been active against the Normans or shown great disinclination to them. Upon some right, or some pretence, the greatest part of their lands were adjudged to be forfeited. William gave these lands to Normans, to be held by the tenure of knight-service, {{according to the law}} which modified that service in all parts of Europe. These people he chose because he judged they must be faithful to the interest on which they depended; and this tenure he chose because it raised an army without expense, called it forth at the least warning, and seemed to secure the fidelity of the vassal by the multiplied ties of those services which were inseparably annexed to it. In the establishment of these tenures, William only copied the practice which was now become very general. One fault, however, he seems to have committed in this distribution: the immediate vassals of the crown were too few; the <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>capite</b> {{at the end of this}} reign did not exceed seven hundred; the eyes of the subject met too many great objects in the state besides the state itself; and the dependence of the inferior people was weakened by the interposal of another authority between them and the crown, and this without being at all serviceable to liberty. The ill consequence of this was not so obvious whilst the dread of the English made a good correspondence between the sovereign and the great vassals absolutely necessary; but it afterwards appeared, and in a light very offensive to the power of our kings.|$|R
