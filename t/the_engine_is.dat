5|$|In chronological order, {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft {{powered by the}} Merlin to enter service were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, and Supermarine Spitfire. Although <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> most {{closely associated with the}} Spitfire, the four-engined Avro Lancaster was the most numerous application, followed by the twin-engined de Havilland Mosquito.|$|E
5|$|This new 'dreamworld' {{engine was}} {{successfully}} {{released to the}} public for use on the live servers on June 25, 2015. While <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> still in a 'beta' state, it is available for use with the 'live' production servers.|$|E
5|$|The California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{classified}} the Volt as Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV), as CARB tests do {{not account}} for the Volt electric range. With all tests conducted under conditions where <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> running the CARB rated the Volt's carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at 1.3 g/mile (0.81 g/km), missing the limit for SULEV classification by 0.3 g/mile (0.19 g/km).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} specifically for the GEN H-4 helicopter, in which four of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> mounted to provide redundancy.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> a {{powerful}} liquid-cooled Isotta-Fraschini Asso XI R.C.40 engine capable of [...] driving a three-bladed metal propeller. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> cooled by two radiators {{either side of}} the fuselage in ducts just behind the cockpit. Fuel for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> housed in two fuel tanks located mid-fuselage along with an oil tank.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were few}} factors that made #28 {{a good choice}} for {{operational}} restoration. One, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> retired in 1965 in operating condition. Two, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> stored indoors to protect it from vandalism and weather. And three, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> kept on display indoors for the entire time it was at the museum.|$|R
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} {{oxygen and}} low-pressure fuel turbopumps were mounted 180° apart on the orbiter's aft fuselage thrust structure. The {{lines from the}} low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' {{first major}} project {{after the company}} split from Valve Corporation in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the {{development}} of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the idea is to have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. The game is powered by Crytek's CryEngine, as they believed that <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> capable of creating the dark and dense forests featured in the game. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> not leading, <b>the</b> {{regulator}} on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could <b>be</b> {{operated by}} a lever worked by compressed air; when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> leading, <b>the</b> control lever could be disconnected, allowing the regulator {{to be controlled by}} hand in the ordinary way.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{capable of}} {{developing}} 350 BHP continuously. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> a development of <b>the</b> Rover Company's <b>engines</b> that has <b>been</b> developed {{as part of}} its connection with Frank Whittle during WW2.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} a {{production}} Honda K20A <b>engine.</b> For <b>the</b> first season <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> tuned by Heini Mader Racing. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> meets FIA Super 2000 regulations, like the WTCC the IFM supports.|$|R
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, an {{intermediate}} performance version of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> introduced with a four-barrel carburetor and 9.0:1 compression, rated at [...] at 4,400 rpm and 300 lbft Nm at 2,800 rpm. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> an option {{on both the}} initial 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang and the Mercury Comet. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> known as <b>the</b> [...] "D-code" [...] from the letter code used to identify <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> in <b>the</b> VIN. [...] <b>The</b> D-code <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> relatively rare, as it was only offered as an optional <b>engine</b> in <b>the</b> {{latter half of the}} 1964 model year.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same 226.2 in³ (3.7 L) four-cylinder L-head design {{used in the}} Model G, {{and that}} car's simple sliding-gear {{transmission}} <b>was</b> also adopted. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> bored out to 255.4 in³ (4.2 L) for 1910 and 286.3 in³ (4.7 L) for 1911 and 1912. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> reworked, with a longer stroke, for 1913, giving 365.8 in³ (6.0 L) of displacement. This same engine served in 1914.|$|R
50|$|After its press release, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{promptly}} {{purchased by}} Tilted Mill Entertainment, a small production company out of Massachusetts. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> also available out for purchase to anyone for US$250,000 at its release.|$|R
5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine's</b> mascot <b>is</b> Bob <b>the</b> Hamster, {{the protagonist}} of the game of which <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} built for, Wandering Hamster.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> {{featured}} in both Titanic films, [...] "A Night To Remember" [...] (1958) and the made-for-TV film [...] "S.O.S. Titanic" [...] (1979). <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> {{very similar to}} <b>the</b> actual <b>engines</b> on board <b>the</b> Titanic albeit <b>the</b> Titanic's <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> 4 cylinders as opposed to three. Yet <b>the</b> Kempton <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> correct size (4 stories tall) and of the correct type (triple expansion). Alas, land based pumping engines, Like Kempton Park's engines have flywheels: Marine Steam Engines have no flywheels.|$|R
5000|$|Unusually, the {{turbopump}} for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> mechanically {{driven from}} outside. A mechanical drive shaft from the accessory drive {{of the main}} turbojet provided the [...] needed at 5,070 rpm, provided that <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> running at full speed. As the propellants <b>are</b> hypergolic, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> can <b>be</b> ignited repeatedly simply by engaging the clutch drive to the pump.|$|R
5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds {{the most fun}} in designing original mecha, thinking about how a pilot enters and where <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is.</b> With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs. He drew square ones later on when cars in reality started to become sleek and aerodynamic.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1938 <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> bore <b>was</b> {{increased}} to 77.47 mm and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> renamed E 4. The increase in bore increased the following: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1914, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> sold to <b>the</b> Stockton Terminal and Eastern Railroad, {{and served}} that road until 1953. In that year, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> retired from service and {{donated to the}} Travel Town Museum, where it is {{currently}} displayed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> of an {{inverted}} vertical triple-expansion type, 62 ft tall from basement {{to the top}} of the valve casings and each weighing over 800 tons. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> thought to be the biggest ever built in the UK.|$|R
25|$|The Stemme S10 is a self-launching {{sailplane}} {{produced by}} Stemme AG in Strausberg (Germany) since the 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> mounted amidships and it features an unusual folding propeller which is stowed inside the aircraft's nose-cone when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> not in use.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{designated}} the General Electric F103 in United States Air Force service on KC-10 Extenders and Boeing E-4s.|$|E

50|$|The sole {{preserved}} Ps-4 {{is number}} 1401 of the 1926 order, which was saved in 1951 by the railroad's outside legal counsel and later president Graham Claytor, who requested that <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>be</b> donated to <b>the</b> Smithsonian Institution. The Southern Railway management obliged, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> placed in storage while the institution prepared its new home. In 1961, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> placed inside <b>the</b> Smithsonian's newly built National Museum of American History {{which opened in}} 1964. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> currently remains displayed in this museum.|$|R
25|$|When <b>the</b> AE1A <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{accepted}} by <b>the</b> IJNAS, its coded designation was dropped {{and it was}} name after the Atsuta factory where <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> manufactured.|$|R
50|$|Like most {{stationary}} <b>engines</b> of <b>the</b> time, Zimmerman's new <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> water-cooled - {{a jacket}} around the cylinder {{was filled with}} water to keep <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> cool while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> in use. Generally, the water evaporated as <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> operated and more water had {{to be added to}} the water jacket of <b>the</b> typical <b>engine</b> throughout <b>the</b> day.|$|R
