To assess the role of B. vexillum populations in the transfer of matter at the water-sediment interface of the lagoon ecosystem, in situ measurements were performed of individual biodeposition of <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> particulate organic matter, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and pheopigments. Fluxes of particulate matter in sediment traps, with and without individuals placed in cages, were compared at various seasons (66 experiments) and related to concentrations in seston. Particulate matter biodeposit production was significantly linked to B. vexillum biomass and to suspended chlorophyll a and pheopigment concentrations, but not to temperature or to other particulate material concentrations in seston. Daily average biodeposit production of <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and particulate organic carbon by unit of biomass were 298 mg g AFDW− 1 d− 1 and 45 mg g AFDW− 1 d− 1, respectively.

40|$|Exposure {{of small}} animals to {{cigarette}} smoke {{is widely used}} as a model to study the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, protocols and exposure systems utilised vary substantially and {{it is unclear how}} these different systems compare. We analysed the gene expression profile of six publically available murine datasets from different cigarette smoke-exposure systems and related the gene signatures to three clinical cohorts. 234 genes significantly regulated by cigarette smoke in at least one model were used to construct a 55 -gene network containing 17 clusters. Increasing numbers of differentially regulated clusters were associated with higher <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> concentrations in the different datasets. Low total particulate matter-induced genes mainly related to xenobiotic/detoxification responses, while higher <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> activated immune/inflammatory processes in addition to xenobiotic/detoxification responses. To translate these observations to the clinic, we analysed the regulation of the revealed network in three human cohorts. Similar to mice, we observed marked differences in the number of regulated clusters between the cohorts. These differences were not determined by pack-year. Although none of the experimental models exhibited a complete alignment with any of the human cohorts, some exposure systems showed higher resemblance. Thus, depending on the cohort, clinically observed changes in gene expression may be mirrored more closely by specific cigarette smoke exposure systems.

We found that one method gave better overall correlations and slopes closer to 1 than did the other methods, but the method overes-timated the nonalgal fraction when the nonalgal absorption to <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> absorption proportion in the sample was low. As a result, a correction is suggested and results are compared with those of the other methods, showing that the combined use of the original algorithm and the correction do configure a suitable basis for differentiating the algal and nonalgal fractions using as input only the total particulate light absorption data. Optical variability of oceans is controlled to a large extent by the amount of biogenic particulate matter present in the water column.

Emission sources considered here include wood and charcoal burning, charcoal making, open waste burning, and vehicles including trucks, cars, buses and two-wheeled vehicles. Emission factors of <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter,</b> black carbon, primary organic carbon and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) have been established. In addition, emission factor measurements were performed in combustion chambers in order to reproduce field burning conditions for tropical hardwood, and obtain particulate emission factors by size (PM 0. 25, PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10). Aerosol samples were collected on quartz filters and analysed using gravimetric and thermal methods. The emission factors of 50 NMVOC species were determined using systematic off-line sampling. Emission factors from wood burning for black carbon, organic carbon and <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> were 0. 8 ± 0. 4  g/kg of dry matter (dm), 9. 29 ± 3. 82  g/kg dm and 34. 54 ± 20. 6  g/kg dm, respectively. From traffic sources, the highest emission factors for all particulate species were emitted from two wheeled vehicles with two-stroke engines (2. 74  g/kg fuel for black carbon, 65. 11  g/kg fuel for organic carbon and 496  g/kg fuel for <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter).</b> The emissions of NMVOCs were lower than those of particles for all sources aside from traffic.

Phytoplankton absorption aph(440) and aph(675) ranged from 0. 03 to 8. 39 m– 1 and from 0. 02 to 5. 21 m– 1, respectively, including a large variability for particles and phytoplankton concentrations (total suspended matter: 1. 6 – 191 mg L– 1; chlorophyll a: 0. 4 – 477. 1 µg L– 1). For the best model, model 6, tripton absorption was modeled using an exponential model with a background constant. The ratios of aph(380) /aph(505), aph(580) /aph(692. 5) and aph(510) /aph(412) were used to model the spectral absorption of phytoplankton.

For a given chlorophyll a concentration (TChla), the concentrations of photosynthetic carotenoids (PSC), photoprotective carotenoids (PPC), and total accessory pigments (AP) were consistently lower in spring than in summer. The chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> were also lower in spring, which can be partly attributed to lower proportions of PPC, PSC, and AP in spring. The spring values of the green-to-blue band ratio of the absorption coefficient were higher than the summer ratios. The blue-to-green ratios of backscattering coefficient were also higher in spring. The higher b(sub b) values and lower blue-to-green b(sub b) ratios in summer were likely associated with higher concentrations of detrital particles in summer compared to spring. Because the product of the green-to-blue absorption ratio and the blue-to-green backscattering ratio is a proxy for the blue-to-green ratio of remote-sensing reflectance, we conclude that the performance of ocean color band-ratio algorithms for estimating pigments in the north polar Atlantic is significantly affected by seasonal shifts in the relationships between absorption and TChla as well as between backscattering and TChla. Intriguingly, however, fairly good estimate of the particulate beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm (potential measure of <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> or particulate organic carbon concentration) can be obtained by applying a single blue-to-green band-ratio algorithm for both spring and summer seasons...|$|E
40|$|Port causes {{environmental}} and health concerns in coastal cities if its operation and development {{are not made}} environmentally compatible and sustainable. An emission inventory is necessary {{to assess the impact}} of port projects or growth in marine activity as well as to plan mitigation strategies. In this study, a detailed emission inventory of <b>total</b> suspended <b>particulate</b> (TSP) <b>matter,</b> respirable <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> (PM(10)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) for a port having operation and construction activities in parallel is compiled. The study has been done for 1 year. Results show that the maximum contribution of emission of air pollutants in the port area was from TSP (68. 5 %) and the minimum was from SO(2) (5. 3 %) to the total pollutants considered in this study. Total TSP emission from all activities of the port was 4, 452 tyr (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) and PM(10) emission was 903 tyr (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) in the year 2006. Re-suspension of dust from paved roads was the major contributor of TSP and PM(10) in the road transport sector. Construction activities of the port had contributed 3. 9 % of TSP and 7. 4 % of PM(10) to <b>total</b> emission of <b>particulate</b> <b>matter.</b> Of the <b>total</b> <b>particulate</b> emissions from various port activities approximately 20 % of TSP could be attributed to PM(10). The sectoral composition indicates that major contribution of SO(2) emission in the port was from maritime sector and major contribution of NO(x) was from road transport sector...|$|R
40|$|<b>Total</b> {{suspended}} <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> {{in ambient}} air was sampled by high-volume samplers at four sites at the Asian Institute of Technology campus, {{west of the}} Phahonyothin Road, Phathumthani Province, 40 km North of Bangkok, Thailand. The concentrations of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), were measured by gas chromatography with flame ionisation and/or liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The PAH profile with relatively high concentrations of benzo(ghi) perylene and coronene, decreasing with {{the distance from the}} road, suggested a substantial contribution from the traffic. The concentrations in the core of the campus were in the same range as those reported for residential areas in the Bangkok Metropolitan. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{short supply chain}} of available biomass from forest and agriculture residues locally available aims to gain environmental benefits deriving from reduced transportation, avoided abiotic depletion of resources and reduced net emissions of green-house gases. The main objective {{of the present study}} was to analyze possible environmental impacts arising from domestic burning of residual biomasses, in terms air pollution. Three different types of woody residual biomasses (Robinia pseudoacacia, Picea abies and Vitis vinifera) were collected within the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in the form of wood chips, converted into pellets and used in controlled combustion tests in a domestic stove. The efficiency of the combustion process and the amount of selected emitted pollutants (carbon monoxide, organic gaseous carbon, nitrogen oxides, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and <b>total</b> suspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter)</b> were evaluated. Moreover, the same analysis and combustion tests were carried out on three commercially available pellets (Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica and softwood mix) to achieve a better interpretation and contextualization of the results obtained. Picea abies developed significantly high concentrations of organic gaseous carbon, benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and rather high carbon monoxide emissions. Vitis vinifera was characterized by the highest <b>total</b> suspended <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and carbon monoxide emissions. Robinia pseudoacacia was a very promising fuel showing both combustion and emission properties similar to the commercial pellets. Thus, with the outcomes of our work we highlighted that possible environmental drawbacks due to air pollution arising from residual biomass burning should be evaluated. Moreover, the scientific community of life cycle assessment scientists may benefit from having updated experimental measurements of air pollutants emitted by a domestic stove loaded with different locally available residual biomasses...|$|R
