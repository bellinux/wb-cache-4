They have a molecular weight of approximately 5000 Daltons and are composed entirely of amino acids. [...] <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> were discovered by Henry Sherwood Lawrence in 1954.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the immunologic specificity of <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> using a chromatographically purified <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> preparation. The specificity of transfer was examined utilizing immunity to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and tuberculin. <b>Transfer</b> <b>factor</b> prepared from a donor immune to KLH successfully transferred KLH skin test reactivity to 10 out of 10 recipients. In contrast, comparable amounts of <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> from two donors not immune to KLH failed to transfer immunity to KLH in 11 recipients despite evidence for successful transfer of tuberculin reactivity. Unlike prior studies {{with a variety of}} antigens, the immunity to KLH in recipients of KLH immune <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> appeared comparable to that of the donor since both could be elicited with the same skin test antigen dose. These observations indicate that <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> can initiate a specific immune response to an antigen not previously encountered by the recipient and that in certain circumstances this immune response can be comparable to that of the donor. These observations on specificity and potency of <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> have important implications for the clinical use of this material...|$|R

40|$|There is recent {{interest}} in whether dialysable <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> can specifically increase immune responses when added to lymphoid cells in vitro. This report demonstrates that <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> preparations (human leucocyte dialysates) `augment' rather than `transfer' lymphocyte transformation responses (DNA synthesis) to tuberculin PPD in vitro {{and that the}} magnitude of this augmentation is proportional to the level of DNA synthesis induced by PPD in the absence of added <b>transfer</b> <b>factor.</b> Experiments showed that <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> preparations from Mantoux-positive or Mantoux-negative `donors' were equally effective in augmenting `recipient' lymphocyte transformation responses to PPD. Thus the extent of augmentation was related, not to the tuberculin sensitivity of the <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> donors, but to that of the recipients. In the absence of tuberculin PPD, <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> preparations sometimes stimulated lymphocyte DNA synthesis, but the extent of this was small and inconstant. The results therefore provide evidence for an antigen-dependent, but not an antigen-specific effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> in increasing lymphocyte DNA synthesis in vitro. It is suggested that leucocyte dialysates contain an augmenting factor which may facilitate the response of antigen-sensitive cells to PPD in vitro, or may facilitate the recruitment into DNA synthesis of cell populations responding to mitogenic lymphokine produced during lymphocyte transformation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> {{are small}} {{proteins}} that "transfer" {{the ability to}} express cell-mediated immunity from immune donors to non-immune recipients. We developed a process for purifying specific <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> to apparent homogeneity. This allowed us to separate individual <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> from mixtures containing several <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> and to demonstrate the antigen-specificity of <b>transfer</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> {{have been shown to}} be an effective means for correction of deficient cellular immunity in patients with opportunistic infections, such as candidiasis or recurrent Herpes simplex and to provide prophylactic immunity against varicella-zoster in patients with acute leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> of bovine and murine origin were purified by affinity chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Cyanogen bromide digests were sequenced. The properties of an apparently conserved sequence on expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by transfer factor recipients were assessed. RESULTS: A novel amino acid sequence, LLYAQDL/VEDN, was identified in each of seven transfer factor preparations. These peptides would not transfer expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity to recipients, which indicates that they are not sufficient for expression of the specificity or immunological properties of native <b>transfer</b> <b>factors.</b> However, administration of the peptides to recipients of native <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> blocked expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by the recipients. The peptides were not immunosuppressive. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the peptides may represent the portion of <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> that binds to the "target cells" for <b>transfer</b> <b>factors.</b> Identification of these cells will be helpful in defining the mechanisms of action of <b>transfer</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} {{cellular}} derived <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> {{as a treatment}} effectively ended in the early 1980s. While the research world was initially excited by the discovery of Dr Lawrence {{and the possibility that}} a small molecule could effect the immune system, the concept of small molecules having such profound biologic effect had not been proven. Despite several successes in using <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> to treat human disease and uncover immune effects, one then-prominent researcher was exposed for falsifying data related to his work on <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> and guinea pigs; effectively casting all of <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> science in a negative light. [...] This scandal was followed shortly thereafter by the discovery of the Interleukin-1 alpha molecule and thus attention further shifted towards research on interleukins. By 1973, it was discovered that blood products could harbor viruses such as hepatitis A, indicating that <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> treatments derived from human or cow blood cells had the potential to transmit these diseases. With the eventual discovery of HIV/AIDS as an additional blood-borne disease most researchers viewed a product derived from blood as an unsafe treatment since screening for hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS would not be developed until after 1985. [...] Some studies using <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> have been conducted after the discovery of HIV/AIDS, but almost all have been outside of the United States.|$|R

The plant-soil (CS) -C- 137 <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> varied maximally 12 -fold among soils and 35 -fold among species when grown on the same soil. Single correlations between <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> and soil properties were found, but they varied widely with plant type and can hardly {{be used as a}} predictive tool because of the few soils used. The variation of (CS) -C- 137 concentrations in plants among soils was related to differences in soil solution Cs- 137 and K concentrations, consistent with previous observations in hydroponics and pot trials. Absolute values of <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> could not be predicted based on a model validated for pot trials. The Cs- 137 activity concentration in soil solution decreased significantly (11 - to 250 -fold) for most soils in the 1997 - 1999 period and is partly explained by decreasing K in soil solution. <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> of lettuce showed both increasing and decreasing trends between 2 consecutive years depending on soil type.
