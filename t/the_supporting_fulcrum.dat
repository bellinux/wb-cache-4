Twenty-one animals were infected and harboured {{a total of}} 82 pentastomids, all belonging to the family Sebekidae and representing at least two genera and three species. Sebekia okavangoensis Riley & Huchzermeyer, was present in the body cavity and lungs; the other two species were restricted to the lungs. Alofia parva n. sp. (14 female; 10 male) was unusual in that <b>the</b> <b>fulcrum</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>the</b> anterior hooks carried a cowl-like extension. The remaining species, provisionally allocated to the genus Sebekia, could not be classified to the generic level with certainty.

6000|$|And again, of the axioms of mechanics: “As we admit no such [...] propositions, {{other than}} as truths inductively {{collected}} from [...] observation, even in geometry itself, it {{can hardly be}} expected [...] that, in a science of obviously contingent relations, we should [...] acquiesce in a contrary view. Let us take one of these axioms and [...] examine its evidence: for instance, that equal forces [...] perpendicularly applied at the opposite ends of equal arms of a [...] straight lever will balance each other. What but experience, we may [...] ask, in the first place, can possibly inform us that a force so [...] applied will have any tendency to turn the lever on its centre at [...] all? or that force can be so transmitted along a rigid line [...] perpendicular to its direction, as to act elsewhere in space than [...] along its own line of action? Surely this is so far from being [...] self-evident that it has even a paradoxical appearance, which is [...] only to be removed by giving our lever thickness, material [...] composition, and molecular powers. Again, we conclude, that the two [...] forces, being equal and applied under precisely similar [...] circumstances, must, if they exert any effort at all to turn the [...] lever, exert equal and opposite efforts: but what a priori [...] reasoning can possibly assure us that they do act under precisely [...] similar circumstances? that points which differ in place are [...] similarly circumstanced as regards the exertion of force? that [...] universal space may not have relations to universal force—or, at all [...] events, that {{the organization of the}} material universe may not be [...] such as to place that portion of space occupied by it in such [...] relations to the forces exerted in it, as may invalidate the [...] absolute similarity of circumstances assumed? Or we may argue, what [...] have we to do with the notion of angular movement in the lever at [...] all? The case is one of rest, and of quiescent destruction of force [...] by force. Now how is this destruction effected? Assuredly by the [...] counter-pressure which <b>supports</b> <b>the</b> <b>fulcrum.</b> But would not this [...] destruction equally arise, and by the same amount of counteracting [...] force, if each force simply pressed its own half of the lever [...] against the fulcrum? And what can assure us that it is not so, [...] except removal of one or other force, and consequent tilting of the [...] lever? The other fundamental axiom of statics, that the pressure on [...] <b>the</b> point of <b>support</b> is <b>the</b> sum of the weights ... is merely a [...] scientific transformation and more refined mode of stating a coarse [...] and obvious result of universal experience, viz., that the weight of [...] a rigid body is the same, handle it or suspend it in what position [...] or by what point we will, and that whatever sustains it sustains its [...] total weight. Assuredly, as Mr. Whewell justly remarks, ‘No one [...] probably ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that the [...] pressure on <b>the</b> <b>support</b> is equal to the sum of the weights.’ ... But [...] it is precisely because in every action of his life from earliest [...] infancy he has been continually making the trial, and seeing it made [...] by every other living being about him, that he never dreams of [...] staking its result on one additional attempt made with scientific [...] accuracy. This would be as if a man should resolve to decide by [...] experiment whether his eyes were useful for the purpose of seeing, [...] by hermetically sealing himself up for half an hour in a metal [...] case.” ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analysis in attachment spacing of tower cranes. Both <b>the</b> <b>support</b> spacing under <b>the</b> rigid <b>support</b> and <b>the</b> flexible <b>support</b> are obtained for this purpose. For deriving <b>the</b> rigid <b>support</b> spacing, differential equation is used. The principle {{is used for}} calculating <b>the</b> <b>support</b> spacing, which <b>the</b> extended segment has the same Euler critical force with the independent segment. <b>The</b> flexible <b>support</b> distance is obtained by setting the integrated stiffness matrix zero, which is equivalent to structural instability. The order of the overall stiffness matrix is big when the tower crane is attached many times. In order to calculate more convenient for solving the matrix determinant, a transfer matrix method is adopted. To verify {{the influence of the}} flexibility caused by <b>the</b> <b>support</b> device, an example is carried out by both rigid and flexible support situations for this purpose, and <b>the</b> <b>support</b> spacing is computed numerically.
