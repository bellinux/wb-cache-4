Still, it remains {{fascinating}} to see how the response to it have varied from place to place. Plus there are some intriguing locales such as Pyongyang are on the horizon. Fortunately, for those who want a quick visual reminder of what’s happened so far, as well as a guide to where the flame is headed, there’s a handy interactive map in the Financial Times. With a name like the FT’s, clever multimedia visuals aren’t the first thing that come to mind, except maybe ones that show bulls and bears fighting it out to illustrate the latest stock market developments. But the FT is often unusually good at covering China, and this is not the only nifty Olympic-related visual at their site. I also like their visual timeline of China’s involvement in the Games, which includes a reminder of the now often forgotten moment in 1960 when an element of protest came into the Rome 1960 Opening Ceremonies, due to a flap over how Taiwan’s team had to describe itself. So much for <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> <b>notion</b> that the Games have never been politicized before, or have only been politicized in a few hot-button years, such as 1936 and 1980...|$|E
40|$|The New Atlantis has {{fired the}} imaginations of its readers since its {{original}} appearance in 1627. Often {{regarded as the}} apotheosis of Bacon's ideas through its depiction of an advanced 'scientific' society, it is also read as a seminal work of science fiction. Standing {{at the threshold of}} early modern culture, this key text incorporates the practical and visionary, utility and utopia. This volume of eight new essays by leading scholars provides a stimulating dialogue between a range of critical perspectives. Encompassing the fields of cultural history, history of science, literature and politics, the collection explores The New Atlantis' complex location within Bacon's oeuvre and its negotiations with cultural debates of the past and present. Contributors consider the book's use of rhetoric, its narrative contexts, its political and ethical implications, its relation to the natural knowledge of the period, and the function of miracles in New Atlantan society. The politics of colonialism and Jewish toleration, its complex representation of gender, and the role and politics of censorship are also explored. This volume will be the ideal companion to Bacon's The New Atlantis and for all students of literature, politics, history, cultural history and history of science [...] . Bacon's complex use of the motif, metaphor, and concept of gender is the subject of Kate Aughterson's lucid discussion, which buries <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> <b>notion</b> that Bacon simply advocates the dominance of a masculine science or a feminine nature...|$|E

The technologies and speculations associated with “virtual reality” and cognate terms (such as “cyberspace”) have recently {{made it possible for}} scores of journalists and academics to develop variations on a favorite theme - the newness of the new, and more specifically, the newness of that new and wildly different world-historical epoch, era, or Zeitgeist into which we are supposedly entering (and on some accounts, have already entered) with the creation of powerful new machines of simulation. The innovative powers of the machines of virtual reality are so extensive, it would seem, that they are even {{supposed to be able to}} achieve the extraordinary feat of revitalizing that tired journalist genre, “gee-whiz” scientific reporting. “Gee whiz,” one can now read, “you just put on a data glove and don the head-mounted display helmet, and step right into a whole new world where the old reality - and even <b>the</b> <b>tired,</b> old-fashioned <b>notion</b> of reality as such - gets replaced by the non-existent reality simulated by the machine.

40|$|By the C 21 st {{the glue}} that bound moral {{communities}} was no longer necessarily a belief in a particular deity or the ritualistic practices that expressed this belief. While notions of the sacred and profane remain, these notions now deal with cultural ideology, economics {{and the politics of}} privilege. Moral communities, Tom Regan 32 argues, continue today, to be founded on the pillars of exclusion. Each community is bound by a 'moral' code that accrues privilege to members and disfavor to non-members. The Australian PhotoJournalist seeks to challenge the orthodoxy developed around journalism with particular reference to photojournalism. In doing this, the publication presents as an exemplar for documentary and journalistic research by combining the work, evidence, conclusions and knowledge developed in-field by leading practitioners of these disciplines. In the context of the work chosen for inclusion in the APJ, journalism and documentary practice is defined as a blending of rigorous investigations and ethnographic research within an aesthetic frame, that combined, disseminate the tacitly understood. Studies of the human condition are studies of the non-rational elements of human practice that have been largely ignored by traditional researchers because they are not conducive to interrogation by scientific methodologies. Pink (2006), a visual ethnographer, argues that the changing paradigms of research methodologies "paved the way for the visual to be increasingly acceptable in researching the human condition "妯r it is no more subjective or objective than written texts" In addition to providing new understanding of human practice each edition of the APJ challenges traditional notions of research and presents documentary practice as legitimate modes of inquiry. Documentary practice and by extension the Australian PhotoJournalist, combines the evidentiary and concrete with the metaphoric and expressive, each of which offers a valuable contribution to the creation and communication of meaning. When used with text, this text image combination stimulates the cognitive and affective spheres of our intelligence allowing us to understand through empathy. Within this context, Epilogue challenges <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> <b>notions</b> of main-stream journalism and documentary practice. It published the work of in-field researchers who undertake long term investigations of their subjects and, in many instances, become stakeholders in the lives of those whose stories are told. The compilation of stories attempt to contextualise human practice within the multidimensional and non-linear frames of human practice. This edition combines the expertise of visually articulate practitioners schooled in research methods and incorporates more holistic research methodologies while exploring the nature of the human condition in the 21 st Century.

50|$|RFV {{can best}} be {{explained}} by example. Assume a perfectly uniform tire mounted on a perfectly round wheel loaded with a constant force against a perfectly round test wheel. As the wheel turns, it turns <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass undergoes repeated deformation and recovery as it enters and exits the contact area. If we measure the radial force between <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> wheel we will see zero change as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. If we now test a typical production tire we will see the radial force vary as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. This variation will be induced by two primary mechanisms, variation in the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and variation in the elastomeric properties of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides {{puncturing}} of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> a flat can {{be caused}} by:failure of or damage to the valve stem;rubbing of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> road, ripping <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> or separation of tire and rim by collision with another object; excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tread allowing explosive tire failure or allowing road debris to tear through it.|$|R
50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the bead of a <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> {{wheel of a}} vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> pressure pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> inside of the wheel rim so that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> stays on <b>the</b> wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{internal}} beadlock is {{very much}} like an inner tube within <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tight against <b>the</b> wheel. The internal beadlock is inflated via its own valve stem. The side of the beadlock closest to the tread, the [...] "case", has a layer of thick fabric, generally polyester, which keeps the beadlock from inflating too far up into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This forces <b>the</b> sides into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which compresses <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R

And by modeling the air in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> cavity-resonance noise is able to simulate. Finite element model also enables to verify easily the effect of structure modification...|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of patching a tire is {{that due to}} the process requiring one to remove <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> from <b>the</b> wheel, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> must be balanced again when it is put back on <b>the</b> wheel. <b>Tire</b> sealant also creates an imbalance in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> but since it is a temporary repair, it is considered less of an issue. However, the issue of disposal of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> sealant, <b>the</b> hazards to the technician, {{as well as the}} required cleaning of both the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> as well as the wheel could all be considered disadvantages of tire sealant.|$|R
50|$|Tires can leak air for {{a variety}} of reasons. These include, but are not limited to: damage to the wheel itself, a damaged valve stem, a {{puncture}} in <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (which can be hard to find if the puncturing object didn't embed itself in <b>the</b> <b>tire)</b> and improper installation of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> which could involve the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> being cut when installed with excessive force.|$|R
50|$|The bicycle pump {{compresses}} air. When {{the cylinder}} is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump {{and then into}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> via <b>the</b> valve, which is forced open by {{the pressure of the}} air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is at <b>the</b> correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> cap can be replaced on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is indexed into the test station {{and placed on}} the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers {{to make contact with}} the upper bead. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and apply <b>the</b> set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract <b>the</b> measurement parameters. <b>Tires</b> are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.|$|R

30|$|As {{the running}} wheel uses rubber <b>tires,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> parts of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> are {{subjected}} to uneven pressure during the crossing of the finger-band, resulting in {{a change in the}} amount of deformation and a vertical vibration of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> [7, 8].|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>the</b> angle between the actual path of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (<b>the</b> angle that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> leans from <b>the</b> vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is fitted by heating to a {{controlled}} temperature, avoiding overheating. This causes <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to expand. <b>The</b> wheel centre, usually already {{mounted on the}} axle, is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which is flange side up. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> cools, and <b>the</b> retaining ring (a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop) is fitted into the groove. Hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down on to the retaining ring.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> bead is <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that {{contacts}} <b>the</b> rim {{on the wheel}}. The bead {{is typically}} reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel {{to ensure that a}} tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports <b>the</b> <b>tire's</b> profile.|$|R

50|$|A {{flat tire}} (British English: flat tyre) is a {{deflated}} pneumatic tire, {{which can cause}} {{the rim of the}} wheel to ride on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tread or <b>the</b> ground potentially resulting in loss of control of the vehicle or irreparable damage to <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> most common cause of a flat tire is puncturing of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> by a sharp object, such as a nail, letting air escape. Depending on the size of <b>the</b> puncture, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> may deflate slowly or rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Overly narrow rims in {{relation}} to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> width may cause poor handling as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> may distort sideways under fast cornering. On motorcycles, a narrow rim will alter <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> profile, concentrating tire wear {{in a very small}} area during cornering, with a smaller contact patch during braking.|$|R
50|$|The {{diameter}} of the circle of forces, and therefore the maximum horizontal force that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> can generate, depends upon many factors, including the design of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and its condition (age and temperature, for example), the qualities of the road surface, and the vertical load on <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{for this}} {{technique}} is the performance characteristics of <b>the</b> modern automotive <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tires</b> on your car have a specific maximum amount of grip (one component of 'grip' being friction). <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is also load sensitive——that is the maximum grip developed at any instant in time is dependent upon the force applied at <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to tarmac interface. The driver has great influence upon the load on a given <b>tire</b> and also <b>the</b> rate at which that load is applied to <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most tire {{chains are}} {{wrapped around the}} {{circumference}} of <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> and held in place with rim chains, which may be chain or cable, elastic or adjustable tensioners. Automatic chains do not wrap around <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> but swing under <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> from devices permanently mounted under the vehicle which deploy via an electronic solenoid activated in the cab. Spikes-Spider (registered trademark) mount onto <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> from one side. FlexTrax (registered trademark) uses a ratcheting system for easier installation.|$|R
50|$|Tire {{forces are}} divided into three axes: radial, lateral, and {{tangential}} (or fore-aft). The radial axis runs from <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> center toward <b>the</b> tread, and is the vertical axis running from the roadway through <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> center toward <b>the</b> vehicle. This axis supports the vehicle’s weight. The lateral axis runs sideways across the tread. This axis is parallel to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> mounting axle on the vehicle. The tangential axis is {{the one in the}} direction of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> travel.|$|R
5000|$|Skid marks {{are divided}} into [...] "acceleration marks" [...] created on acceleration, if the engine {{provides}} more power than <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> can transmit; [...] "braking marks," [...] if the brakes [...] "lock up" [...] and cause <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to slide; or [...] "yaw marks", if <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> slides sideways. Each has a characteristic appearance, and an experienced accident reconstructor or forensic engineer can often determine what the vehicle was doing by examining the marks left by <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A {{bead breaker}} {{is a tool}} used for {{separating}} <b>tires</b> from rims. <b>The</b> inner-most diameter of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that interfaces with a wheel is called <b>the</b> <b>Tire</b> Bead. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> bead is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the Bead Bundle. [...] The inner-most surface of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> bead creates <b>the</b> air seal between <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and rim on a radial-ply tire and a bias-ply <b>tire.</b> Often, <b>the</b> bead can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring {{the use of a}} bead breaker in order to be removed.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of ted tire {{sealants}} which act {{in a similar way}} to self-sealing tires. These compounds are normally injected through <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> valve. <b>The</b> rotating force then distributes the compound onto the inner surface of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to act as a self-sealing lining within <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The final method, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> plug, can be {{performed}} without removing <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> penetrating object is removed from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and a plug coated in rubber cement then inserted with a handle, typically supplied with the kit. Many technicians consider plugs less reliable than patching though more reliable than sealant.|$|R
50|$|It is {{extremely}} important for owners to {{have an understanding of}} what is safe and what is not {{when it comes to their}} <b>tires.</b> <b>The</b> three major areas to keep an eye on is the tread, sidewall, and air pressure of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Having <b>the</b> correct air pressure in your vehicle's tires lets your vehicle perform in the most efficient way possible. When objects such as a screw or nail puncture a tire, it creates a small leak in <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This leads to under-inflation of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> When a tire is under-inflated, it causes the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to heat up. This heat compromises the internal structure of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which can lead to a blowout. When a tire is over-inflated, it wears the tread down faster, and becomes more prone to catching nails or screws in <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> best way to check tire maintenance is to check the air pressure, because that will lead you to whatever problem your tire might have.|$|R
50|$|Sticky {{materials}} such as mud may adhere to <b>the</b> smooth outer <b>tire</b> surface, while smooth loose objects such as stones can become temporarily embedded in the tread grooves as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> rolls over <b>the</b> ground. These materials can be ejected {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> at high velocity as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> imparts kinetic energy to the attached objects. For a vehicle moving forward, the top of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is rotating upward and forward, and can throw objects into the air at other vehicles or pedestrians in front of the vehicle.|$|R
