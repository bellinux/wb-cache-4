5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> inland centers of Norte Chico were {{at the center of a}} broad regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E

Jose Sarria was approved and entered the Army Reserve, continuing his studies as he waited to be called up to active duty. Shortly before he was scheduled for induction in the regular Army, his beloved second father, Charles Millen, died of a heart attack. Sarria's induction was delayed a month, then he was sworn in and ordered to Sacramento, California, for basic training with the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

In the same year, he survived a revolt in Constantinople (the Nika riots), which solidified his power but ended with the deaths of a reported 30,000 to 35,000 rioters on his orders. The western conquests began in 533, as Justinian sent his general Belisarius to reclaim the former province of Africa from the Vandals {{who had been in}} control since 429 with their capital at Carthage.

5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics.

Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting.

Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E
5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthenware furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears of the grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E

5|$|The first {{televised}} prime ministerial {{debate was}} organised by the state-owned broadcaster Finnish Broadcasting Company on 31 March in Tampere and included the chairpersons {{of the four}} parties leading in the opinion polls. The European sovereign debt crisis featured prominently in the debate; {{the leaders of the}} governing coalition, Katainen and Kiviniemi, defended Finland's participation in guaranteeing the loans to crisis-ridden EU countries claiming that Finland would otherwise risk plunging into a new recession as the country is dependent on exports to other European countries. As the chairpersons of the leading opposition parties, Soini and Urpilainen denied this claim and insisted that the debt-ridden countries should rather be allowed to go into their own debt restructuring. Urpilainen was not entirely against emergency measures aimed at saving these countries, but insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> European banks ought to play a larger role in the guarantees. Soini continued his criticism of the euro, reiterating that no referendum was ever called on the currency union — he remained steadfast on his party's opposition to Finland guaranteeing the loans and presented the upcoming election as a referendum on the issue. On other economic issues, Kiviniemi continued to insist that spending cuts are not necessary in the following years — a claim repudiated by the other party leaders. Urpilainen and, initially, also Katainen were willing to make cuts on military spending; Soini, however, contested the cut but was instead ready to cut development aid and immigration-related expenses.|$|E

5000|$|Actually, Verstein argues, {{this data}} {{strongly}} supported a different theory of manipulation. <b>The</b> <b>majors</b> bought up potential hot oil {{that was being}} priced below <b>the</b> market—oil <b>that</b> if included in calculating the benchmark (for example, if bought up {{by one of the}} jobber middlemen whose purchases were included in the benchmark) would have lowered the benchmark and thus lowered <b>the</b> prices <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> received for all of their oil. But <b>the</b> prices <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> paid for <b>the</b> potential hot oil did not go into the benchmark, and the prices the jobbers would have paid did not go into the benchmark (because the jobbers never bought that oil). [...] "By buying up any oil priced more cheaply than the current benchmark price, the oil companies could support the benchmark price against falling with the market." [...] Since 91% of the potential hot oil <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> bought was bought below the benchmark price, and <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> disqualified <b>that</b> oil from inclusion in the benchmark by buying it themselves, the dancing-partner program prevented a huge drop in the spot market benchmark. Apparently, the government failed to realize this.|$|R
