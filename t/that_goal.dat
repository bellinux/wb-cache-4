5|$|After Inhaúma had punched {{through the}} {{defenses}} at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains {{stretched across the}} river at Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a cove that became known as Porto Elisiário (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained full control of the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute <b>that</b> <b>goal.</b> The Brazilian had, however, developed second thoughts about the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{set goals}} {{to achieve a}} variety of {{objectives}} such as losing weight, saving for retirement, and achieving better health. A large body of literature in psychology and consumer behavior shows <b>that</b> <b>goals</b> can help consumers achieve these objectives. However, {{there is almost no}} research that examines how we should set optimal goals. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a parsimonious framework <b>that</b> examines how <b>goals</b> can help performance and how we should set optimal goals. We use the literature on hyperbolic discounting to model these issues. Our results show <b>that</b> <b>goals</b> can often increase performance but can also sometimes encourage procrastination. We show <b>that</b> some <b>goals</b> are worse than having no goals, even when the goals are achieved and the consumer exerts more effort because of the goal. We also find that the presence of goals can lead to myopic consumers behaving as if they were hyperopic. Our results also show that the most difficult goals should be assigned to consumers with moderate levels of motivation and self-control problems. We also find that it is sometimes optimal to set <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> are never achieved. hyperbolic discounting, optimal goal setting, behavioral economics...|$|R

During its first year, the IEDC closed more transactions than similar efforts had during the previous two years combined. Between 2005 and 2008, 485 businesses committed to creating more than 60,000 new jobs and invest $14.5 billion into the Indiana economy.

50|$|Determining a {{successful}} return to netball from injury for most athletes {{is the ability}} to train and compete at pre-injury levels and standards. Measuring this includes things such as; reaching past endurance fitness test levels (beep tests); the ability to perform and complete sport-specific training exercises; and maintaining performance. Achieving these goals at training will best prepare an athlete for what they will experience during competition standards. It is important for the athlete to set realistic <b>goals</b> <b>that</b> they are able to achieve. They must understand <b>that</b> these <b>goals</b> may need to be long term, as not everything can be achieved over night.

5|$|Winning the {{contract}} to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF {{would be a huge}} boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued <b>that</b> <b>goal</b> as soon as the Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the Pratt & Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt & Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.|$|E
5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish <b>that</b> <b>goal,</b> and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, prior of Gregory's own monastery of St Andrew in Rome, to {{head the}} mission to Kent. Gregory {{selected}} monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish kings. The pope wrote {{to a number of}} Frankish bishops on Augustine's behalf, introducing the mission and asking that Augustine and his companions be made welcome. Copies of letters to some of these bishops survive in Rome. The pope wrote to King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, as well as their grandmother Brunhilda of Austrasia, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King Chlothar II of Neustria for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and were asked to allow some Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to ensure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which enjoyed the evident support of his wife's relatives and people. The Franks at that time were attempting to extend their influence in Kent, and assisting Augustine's mission furthered <b>that</b> <b>goal.</b> Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came {{for the company to}} develop a new broiler, it turned to its {{equipment}} manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met <b>that</b> <b>goal</b> by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999.|$|E

Daniel and Henrik became the fourth pair of twins to have played in the NHL. Three days later, Daniel scored his first career NHL goal against goaltender Dan Cloutier of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Assisted by Henrik, the goal tied the game at 4–4 with 1:13 minutes left to go in a 5–4 regulation win. On 30 November 2000, he suffered a shoulder injury, sidelining him for four games. During his recovery, he was reprimanded by Canucks Head Coach Marc Crawford, who told him that playing through pain is part of being in the NHL. Later in the season, he missed an additional three games due to a back injury, shortening his rookie season to 75 games. He became the first rookie in 2000–01 to reach 20 goals when he scored on 21 March 2001, in a 1–1 tie against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Finishing the campaign with <b>that</b> <b>goal</b> total, he tied for second among League rookies in scoring with Shane Willis, behind Brad Richards. He also had 14 assists for 34 points in total. Making his Stanley Cup playoff debut against the Colorado Avalanche, Daniel recorded an assist in the opening game of the first-round series, a 5–4 loss for the Canucks. He added his first NHL playoff goal later in the series as the Canucks were eliminated in four-straight games. He and Henrik played primarily on the Canucks' third line. Daniel received one third-place vote from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year, finishing eighth in award balloting overall.|$|E

40|$|Although {{self-control}} {{often requires}} behavioral inaction (i. e., not eating {{a piece of}} cake), the process of inhibiting impulsive behavior is commonly characterized as cognitively active (i. e., actively exerting self-control).

Experiment 1 used a delay discounting task to assess the ability to delay gratification with respect to money. Experiment 2 used a Go/No-Go task to assess the ability to inhibit a dominant but incorrect motor response to the words “condom” and “sex”.
