25|$|The {{point about}} {{remoteness}} of damages under s 2(1) was {{treated in the}} controversial case of Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson. Here Mr Rogerson bought a car on hire purchase, from a Honda dealer, financed by Royscot Trust Ltd. When Mr Rogerson fell behind in his repayments and sold away the car, Royscot Trust Ltd sued the Honda dealer, because they found it had misrepresented {{the proportion of the}} deposit Mr Rogerson had put down for the car. On this basis they argued that Honda was liable for them not being able to recover the cost of the loan (Mr Rogerson had no money). Royscot Ltd argued that the loss was too remote, or that Mr Rogerson's wrongful sale was a break in <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>chain.</b> But the Court of Appeal held that in any event the test under s 2(1) was the same as in the tort of deceit, that one should be liable for all consequences. Balcombe LJ said this followed from the clear wording of the Act.|$|E
2500|$|Causal {{determinism}} is [...] "the {{idea that}} every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions {{together with the}} laws of nature". However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that [...] "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>chain</b> that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, {{it is still the}} case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way". Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that {{there is nothing in the}} universe that is uncaused or self-caused. Historical determinism (a sort of path dependence) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions. In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding eventsa combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature. Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).|$|E

Most of model-based diagnosis systems based on physical parametric models cannot cope with such phenomena, and thus the deeper causes underlying the faults remain untouched. This article describes a diagnosis method based on the fault event models, which represent generic abnormal transitions which could commonly occur in components in terms of conceptual attributes such as existence and shape. A framework and {{an example of the}} reasoning integrated with the conventional methods are presented.
