5|$|As {{proposed}} by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences {{in order to reduce}} the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with <b>time-delay</b> fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.|$|E

The proposed algorithm employs higher order harmonic-balance approximations (HBA’s) for the predicted periodic solutions of the <b>time-delayed</b> systems. As compared to the same study of feedback systems without time delays, the HBA’s used in the new algorithm include only some simple modifications.

Note that research on synchronization between <b>time-delayed</b> chaotic systems has been extensively carried out, see, for example, [19 – 21]. Recently, dual-anticipating, dual and dual-lag synchronization [22] between two identical <b>time-delayed</b> chaotic systems, lag synchronization [23] were investigated, where lag or anticipatory dynamics occurred, i.e., there existed a lag time or anticipatory time phase shift between state vectors. While results about zero lag time difference between synchronized state shifts, i.e., isochronal synchronization [24, 25] are also obtained between <b>time-delayed</b> systems. Note that projective synchronization [26, 27] between <b>time-delayed</b> chaotic systems was extensively investigated. However, results about isochronal function projective synchronization between chaotic and <b>time-delayed</b> chaotic systems are still few. In this article, isochronal function projective synchronization scheme between chaotic and <b>time-delayed</b> chaotic systems with unknown parameters is proposed. The method is shown to be effective by applying to Lorenz and hyper-chaotic Chen systems.|$|R
