500|$|Next, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being like Captain Kirk from the Star Trek series, with the slide showing [...] "Being like Meeting Captain Kirk". Meeting Captain Kirk”] Pausch explained that he realized that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> he just could not do, {{and that was one}} of them. He eventually changed the goal into meeting William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk. Shatner had written a book on the science of Star Trek, and had gone to Pausch for help with the virtual reality section of the book. Pausch met and worked with Shatner for this purpose. Pausch concluded the section with the story of his becoming an Imagineer at Disney, as well as his achieving the goal of [...] "being one of those guys who wins stuffed animals", which was at a carnival with his wife and children.|$|E
2500|$|In her stipulation, Ambuhl {{admitted}} that between October 20 and December 1, 2003, she was derelict {{of duty in}} that she had [...] "willfully failed to protect Iraqi detainees from abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment." [...] Specifically, Ambuhl stipulated that she witnessed [...] "numerous acts" [...] of abuse, cruelty, and maltreatment, writing that [...] "This time was very confusing for me, and things were done to detainees that I questioned, but that apparently were permissible. But <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that were done that I knew were wrong at the time, and I did not act to stop this behavior to protect the detainees." ...|$|E
2500|$|My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness {{was written}} and drawn by Kabi Nagata, with art colored in a {{two-tone}} palette. According to Nagata, {{she does not}} hesitate to expose her private life {{for the sake of}} creating interesting content for a manga, despite being more introverted when speaking to people in person. She decided to do this {{because of a lack of}} work after she had become a manga artist, thinking that the only way for her to create something interesting that could earn her a living was to base her creation on her own experiences. The writing process involved her writing down things that have happened to her, and her feelings, in the form of a bulleted list, and rearranging the items to form a narrative. When writing, she strove towards neither lowering or glorifying herself, to avoid spreading too negative feelings and making readers unable to relate to the stories. She said that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> she [...] "couldn't touch on" [...] in the manga, that she would like to use in a future work.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which <b>some</b> minds cannot understand; so, instead of answering, changed the subject.|$|R
60|$|FIRST, <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> {{and those}} not a few, {{that we are}} ignorant of, for want of ideas.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> a chappie's mind {{absolutely}} {{refuses to}} picture, and Aunt Julia singing 'Rumpty-tiddley-umpty-ay' {{is one of}} them.|$|R
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E
60|$|As for me, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that I did {{not like}} so well as others, and I suppose {{that that was the}} case with all of you.|$|E
60|$|Will was put {{entirely out of}} countenance by her {{expression}} and the ring of her voice. He held his peace, concluding that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> about this girl beyond his comprehension--in which he was exactly right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, to London; I {{will have}} this matter settled <b>some</b> way; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> Eleanor, which I cannot bear." ...|$|R
60|$|The Attorney-General looked puzzled, as well he might; for <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which <b>are</b> {{beyond the}} {{learning}} of even an Attorney-General.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, dear, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> {{about our}} {{establishment}} {{that are not}} just as I should feel pleased to receive them to." ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy did {{not notice}} his insinuation. [...] "I suppose <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> {{they did in the}} army, and then they couldn't get over the habit. But General Grant says in his 'Life' that he never used a profane expletive." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{although}} Captain Bream {{was a heavy}} sleeper and {{addicted to}} sonorous snoring, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> in nature through which even he could not slumber; and {{one of these things}} proved to be a hymn as sung by the fishermen of the North Sea! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked down}} the street from the hotel to the Arno, and in a few moments he stood on the bridge, where he had talked with that joker in the morning, as they looked down {{together}} on the boiling river. He had a strange wish that the joker might have been with him again, to learn that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which could not be joked away.|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll {{probably}} {{understand it}} even less {{as time goes}} on. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> you'll never understand. There's no particular need you should." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> {{into which}} it is wisest not to pry, {{and one of them}} is the first agony of a strong man's grief.|$|R
60|$|The {{very next}} evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody {{to buy the}} dress, {{determined}} to get the worst over and have done with it. It would be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; {{but he knew he}} would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress.|$|E
60|$|At breakfast {{that morning}} Phonny asked his mother {{if that would}} not be a good day for them to go and see Mary Erskine. Mrs. Henry said that it would be an {{excellent}} day, and that she should be very glad to have them go, for <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> there to be brought home. Besides Beechnut was going to mill, and he could carry them as far as Kater's corner.|$|E
60|$|But {{first we}} all went {{to the office of}} the American Consul, and {{consulted}} him in regard to the proper measures to be taken for searching for the little Corinne in Paris. After that, for some days, Jonas and Pomona spent all their time, and Euphemia and I part of ours, in looking for the child. Euphemia's Parisian exhilaration continued to increase, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> that disappointed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Allardyce. I'm not superstitious as a rule, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which <b>are</b> {{more than}} a sailor can {{be called upon to}} stand." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> in {{this world}} so {{unbelievable}} that even when we know them to be true we still remain {{in a state of}} semi-scepticism.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} care of yourself," [...] she said briefly. [...] "Come, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which I wish {{to say to you}} before Antoinette is ready." ...|$|R
60|$|The Inquisitive Dwarf {{had three}} {{servants}} whom he employed {{to attend to}} his most important business. These were a Gryphoness, a Water Sprite, and an Absolute Fool. This last one was very valuable; for <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> he would do which {{no one else would}} think of attempting. The Dwarf called to him the Gryphoness, the oldest and most discreet of the three, and told her of the departure of the Princess.|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> in Gondour {{which one}} could not shut his eyes to. One was, that ignorance and {{incompetence}} had {{no place in the}} government. Brains and property managed the state. A candidate for office must have marked ability, education, and high character, or he stood no sort of chance of election. If a hod-carrier possessed these, he could succeed; but the mere fact that he was a hod-carrier could not elect him, as in previous times.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, Sir," [...] she said, with {{a secret}} air, [...] "you have heard true. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> of value--why should we hide it from you, our good friend? But, alas! that greedy rogue, the Abbot of Blossholme, has them. He has {{stripped}} my poor Lady as bare as a fowl for roasting. Get them back from him, Sir, and on her behalf I say she'll give you half of them, will you not, my Lady?" ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{the series}} {{takes place in}} [...] "Miami", <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> in the anime's Miami that don't {{fit in with the}} real Miami, Florida. Such as: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it, my dear; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> {{which a man}} cannot bear:--I cannot bear that;" [...] and he put {{his hand}} upon the newspaper.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel considered. [...] "I think you're right; but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> I can't help minding: for {{instance}} when my friend's attacked or when I myself am praised." ...|$|R
60|$|So much I knew; {{the rest}} I {{was left to}} suppose. The Doctor and Marcella told me much, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> too sacred to be told, even to me. So that to this day I don't know how the doctor found out that Marcella loved him. All I know is that one day, just a month before her sixteenth birthday, the two came hand in hand to Miss Sara and me, as we sat on Miss Sara's veranda in the twilight, and told us simply that they had plighted their troth to each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{him all the}} {{way through}} he was {{generally}} even tempered," [...] one has said who met him at that time. [...] "But occasionally there was a flash from his eye that made his opponent draw back in quick order. He would stand a good deal, but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> he wouldn't take, and they knew it. One thing is certain, after he was in the Assembly for a few months everybody knew perfectly that to come to him with any bill that was the least bit shady {{was a waste of time}} and effort. Roosevelt wouldn't stand for it a minute." ...|$|E
60|$|Fan was {{prepared}} for this. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> not to be revealed; she remembered that Mary had looked into her very soul when she had heard the strange story, and her quick apprehension and knowledge of human nature had no doubt supplied the links that were missing in it. Now by anticipation she had prepared a narrative which would run smoothly, and began it without further delay; and {{for half an hour}} Constance listened with intense interest, only interrupting to bestow a kiss and whisper a tender consoling word when her friend was at last compelled, with faltering speech, to confess that she was no legitimate child of her father.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot blame you, Suzanne, for <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which <b>are</b> {{not to be}} borne. Do {{therefore}} as {{your conscience}} teaches you, {{if you have the}} means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] I answered, [...] "but, Louis, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> {{which one}} <b>is</b> forced to do, {{whatever}} the risk may be. This {{was one of}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Feeling of {{all sorts}} is out of date," [...] he {{admitted}} patiently, [...] "yet <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> which endure. I should be honoured by your friendship, Lady Maggie." ...|$|R
