5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed the idea of <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> as a completed action, viewing it {{from start to finish}} as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} the processing of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> from <b>the</b> music terminology according to the lexicographical raster for a German-Czech dictionary of music terminology that {{will be available in}} the form of an online database by the end of the year 2014. For processing <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> I used an empiric method based on research in the online linguistic corpuses, where relevant examples of the use of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> were searched. One of the main aspects this thesis is dedicated to is specifying the group of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> that will be included into the database. The main source for the selection of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> was <b>the</b> Duden Universal Wörterbuch (DUW). In the inventorying of the German musical terms, its macrostructure has shown itself to be insufficient. The group of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> intended for processing was therefore expanded by other entries...|$|R

5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. <b>The</b> <b>verb</b> {{comes at}} the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> of the matrix clause.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} {{chemical}} element {{is not related to}} <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> of the same spelling, which is derived from Proto-Germanic *laidijan- ("to lead").|$|E
5|$|Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals {{follow the}} noun they modify. Adverbs {{likewise}} follow <b>the</b> <b>verb.</b> Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. Adjectives are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a copula.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{languages}} {{that have}} <b>verb</b> serialization, <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> must appear consecutively with nothing intervening. In other languages, however, {{it is possible}} for arguments, normally the object of one of <b>the</b> <b>verbs,</b> to come in between <b>the</b> serialized <b>verbs.</b> <b>The</b> resulting construction is a sequence of verb phrases rather than of plain <b>verbs.</b> <b>The</b> following example is from the Nigerian Yoruba: ...|$|R

50|$|Within <b>the</b> groups, <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> tend to {{have similar}} forms, but often vastly differing {{conjugation}} possibilities and behaviours. Some of <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> are only used {{in a handful of}} tenses and moods; some verbs indicate negation by negating <b>the</b> deficient <b>verb</b> itself, some by negating <b>the</b> main <b>verb,</b> and some may do either (or even both at the same time).|$|R
5|$|Negation {{is mostly}} {{expressed}} by -güj after participles {{and by the}} negation particle biš after nouns and adjectives; negation particles preceding <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> (for example in converbal constructions) exist, but tend {{to be replaced by}} analytical constructions.|$|E
5|$|Nominal {{morphology}} {{is significantly}} less complex {{than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>verb.</b> There {{are a number of}} case suffixes, denoting ergative, absolutive, dative, allative, locative, ablative, semblative, temporal, instrumental and so on.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd person {{singular}} and plural nominative forms, ngonggega and bogo, {{are labeled}} 'rare' {{because they are}} gradually becoming disused. Speakers prefer to use non-personal pronouns such as gayh- 'that' or gayh-gorden 'those'. Moreover, since the person and number of the subject is contained in the prefix of <b>the</b> <b>verb,</b> nominative free pronouns are often dropped.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>verbs</b> of {{this group}} begin with a weak {{consonant}} in the simple form of the continuative aspect of the neutral voice. However, in the causative voice, <b>the</b> <b>verbs</b> begin with <b>the</b> corresponding strong consonant.|$|R
5|$|The Imperfect portrays <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E
5|$|The Nahuatl verb {{is quite}} complex and inflects for many {{grammatical}} categories. <b>The</b> <b>verb</b> {{is composed of}} a root, prefixes, and suffixes. The prefixes indicate {{the person of the}} subject, and person and number of the object and indirect object, whereas the suffixes indicate tense, aspect, mood and subject number.|$|E
5|$|The accusative pronouns on {{the other}} hand, may be accusative or dative, {{depending}} on the syntactic requirements of <b>the</b> <b>verb.</b> In the traditional terminology, these pronouns can be either direct or indirect objects.|$|E

5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight verbs {{are heavily}} inflected, being marked for tense, aspect, mode, voice, person, and polarity. Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to <b>the</b> <b>verb,</b> while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E
5|$|English has {{two primary}} tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected {{by using the}} preterit form of <b>the</b> <b>verb,</b> which for the regular verbs {{includes}} the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or {{a change in the}} stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.|$|E

The structure is the future tense of <b>the</b> main <b>verb</b> with either preterite of <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>verb.</b> <b>The</b> structure of the negative frequentative preterite is the negative future tense of <b>the</b> main <b>verb</b> with either preterite of <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>verb.</b>|$|R

5|$|For the {{expression}} of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of <b>the</b> <b>verb.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by <b>the</b> <b>verb</b> by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
