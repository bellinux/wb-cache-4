5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> was to relieve traffic heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> to MD 355 south of MD 80. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
5|$|By 1997, {{the start}} of {{construction}} of the Hampstead Bypass was proposed {{for three to four}} years in the future; at that time, most of the engineering phase was complete but most of the highway right-of-way had yet to be purchased. The three-year timeframe was again put forth in 2001. Finally, in 2004, officials announced that <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> would begin construction in autumn 2005. Construction finally got underway in summer 2006. Houcksville Road's bridge over <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> and the highway's bridges over Shiloh Road and Indian Run were completed in 2007. The roundabouts at MD 482 and {{at the southern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> opened, without connections to the under-construction bypass, in April and May 2009, respectively. The roundabout at the northern end of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> opened when <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> opened to traffic on August 6, 2009. To minimize disruption to the bog turtle habitat, MDSHA installed tunnels under <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> for the turtles to use and employed goats to consume invasive species in the habitat area near <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> rather than remove them with mechanical mowers. Old MD 30 through the center of Hampstead was redesignated MD 30 Business when <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> opened.|$|E
5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> route. The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of <b>the</b> <b>bypass,</b> in 1993 <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> would promote suburban sprawl. The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, several {{changes were}} made to US12's routing. A {{southern}} bypass of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti was converted to a freeway. US12 was rerouted to follow <b>the</b> <b>bypass,</b> supplanting the M-17 and Bypass US112 designations used previously on <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> US112 was also rerouted, and it ran concurrently with US12 along <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> The former route of US12 along Plymouth Road from Ann Arbor east to Detroit was renumbered M-14, and the M-112 designation on the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways was replaced by US12. At {{the same time as}} these {{changes were made}}, the Jackson bypass was upgraded to a full freeway. By the middle of 1958, the Kalamazoo bypass was converted to a full freeway.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft.

40|$|In {{translational}} bypassing, a peptidyl-tRNA::ribosome complex skips over {{a number}} of nucleotides in a messenger sequence and resumes protein chain elongation after a “landing site” downstream of <b>the</b> <b>bypassed</b> region. <b>The</b> present experiments demonstrate that the complex “scans” processively through <b>the</b> <b>bypassed</b> region. This conclusion rests on three observations. (i) When two potential “landing sites” are present, the protein sequence of the product shows that virtually all ribosomes land at the first and virtually none at the second. (ii) In such a sequence with two landing sites, the presence of a terminator triplet in phase in the coding region immediately after the first landing site drastically reduces <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>bypassing.</b> (iii) Internally complementary sequences that can form a stable stemloop in <b>the</b> <b>bypassed</b> region significantly reduce <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>bypassing.</b> We analyze bypassing from a given “takeoff” site to “landing sites” at different distances downstream so as to derive estimates of the frequency of ribosome takeoff and of the stability of <b>the</b> <b>bypassing</b> complex...|$|R
5|$|A Caversham bypass was {{constructed}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's one-way street system. With the construction of <b>the</b> <b>bypass,</b> Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> with Dunedin Southern Motorway.|$|E
5|$|A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: local traffic made up {{of people who had}} moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in the Baltimore area; and truck traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> was continually delayed. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E

5|$|Half a {{mile from}} the start of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> and a short {{distance}} before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast, US20 and NY5 meet NY21 at a four-way intersection. Like US20 and NY5, NY21 once continued directly into downtown, in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction, but now follows US20 and NY5 along the east–west leg of <b>the</b> <b>bypass.</b> Past Bristol Street, <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> widens from two to four lanes and, after meeting two local streets, enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited-access Western Boulevard, albeit with no exits. The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street, where US20, NY5 and NY21 meet the southern terminus of NY332. NY21 departs <b>the</b> <b>bypass,</b> following NY332 into downtown, while US20 and NY5 continue onto the four-laned, median separated Eastern Boulevard, the original section of the US20 and NY5 bypass of Canandaigua.

5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt.

5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. The alternative to <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E

5000|$|There are 2657 km of {{national}} secondary roads in Ireland, making up slightly over 50% {{of the entire}} national route (national primary and national secondary) network. National secondary routes are generally more poorly maintained than primary routes (although their quality can vary widely), but often carry more traffic than regional roads. Almost the entire network {{of national}} secondary roads is single carriageway, {{although there are some}} short sections of dual carriageway on <b>the</b> Tallaght <b>bypass</b> section of <b>the</b> N81, on the N52 at Dundalk, on the N85 at Ennis, on the N62 at Athlone, on the N69 at Tralee and on the N71 between Cork and Bandon. Typically, national secondary roads are of a similar standard or higher than regional roads although some are of lower quality than the better sections of regional roads. Many of them have been resurfaced with higher quality pavements in recent years with relatively smooth surfaces and good road markings and signposting. However, road widths and alignments are often inadequate, with many narrow and winding sections.

5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to follow the same style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E
