Lena Philipsson's use of a microphone stand in her performance of [...] "Det gör ont" [...] at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the semifinals to show what had happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> stand in the years since her win. Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of Dagens Media criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was [...] "the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition" [...] and the event had become [...] "a cross between [...] Fame Factory and [...] Stadskampen".|$|E
500|$|Ono {{influenced}} Lennon {{to produce}} more [...] "autobiographical" [...] output and, after [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", they {{decided it would be}} better to form their own band rather than put the material out under the Beatles name. In 1969, the Plastic Ono Band's first album, Live Peace in Toronto 1969, was recorded during the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival. This first incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and performed an avant-garde set along with the band, finishing with music that consisted mainly of feedback, while she screamed and sang.|$|E

As Durand continues singing, several individuals enter and exit the room while getting their picture taken, each leaving with a CD in their hand. The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha makes a cameo appearance posing in the booth {{with members of the}} band. Durand sings into a microphone while Chase and Schlesinger play their guitars.

30|$|The sound {{activity}} represents {{whether or}} not sound is active in each time frame. This sound activity estimation enables sound detection.

30|$|In [29], the {{decomposition}} of the multichannel Wiener filter into a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and a single-channel Wiener post filter for an arbitrary microphone arrangement is presented. The approach {{is based on}} the assumption that the wind noise is uncorrelated at <b>the</b> <b>microphones,</b> while having equal noise power spectral densities, but arbitrary acoustic transfer functions (ATFs). From these assumptions follows for closely spaced microphones that a simple delay-and-sum (DS) beamformer achieves maximum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) beamforming, because equal ATFs from <b>the</b> speech source <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> can be assumed for low frequencies.|$|R
2500|$|Like Crosby, Paul and Ford {{used the}} now-ubiquitous {{recording}} technique known as close miking, where <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> {{is less than}} [...] from the singer's mouth. This produces a more-intimate, less-reverberant sound than is heard when a singer is [...] or more from <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> When implemented using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in <b>the</b> voice due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone's</b> proximity effect and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard. The result is a singing style which diverged strongly from the unamplified theater-style singing that is heard in the musical comedies of the 1930s-40s.|$|R
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down the phone is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps as she ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
500|$|Madonna and Bray {{started on}} the {{re-recording}} and changed some portion of the lyrics. Bray commented on the recording sessions as: [...] "I've always kind of made the rib cage and the skeleton [...] of the song already– she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut [...] She writes in a stream of mood really." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted {{that at one point}} of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing {{with the rest of the}} composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and sang the words [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me".

500|$|Swift {{performed}} a medley, which included [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Wearing casual white blouse and black skinny jeans, Swift performed [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] and then announced, [...] "Its a fairly tale and {{an honor to}} share the stage with Stevie Nicks". Following, the two {{performed a}} cover of Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Rhiannon" [...] (1976). Swift then grabbed her acoustic guitar for {{the third and final}} part in her medley, jumping into a twangy version of [...] "You Belong with Me". Nicks stood back, tapping her tambourine and nodding, every so often stepping up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> to sing with Swift. Eric Ditzian of MTV News was disappointed at Swift's and Nicks' harmonies, but said the two [...] "made for a compelling twosome". The performance followed much backlash in regards to Swift's off key singing, which caused Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, to issue a statement defending the performance.|$|E

500|$|Before Waters' performance, {{his band}} backed Otis Spann, {{who was the}} band leader, and John Lee Hooker. At about 17 p.m., Waters entered the stage, wearing black, {{while the rest of}} the band wore white formal dress. At Newport 1960 opens with then-unreleased [...] "I Got My Brand on You", which was {{recorded}} one month prior, and [...] "(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man", both written by Willie Dixon. Next are the Big Joe Williams cover [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", Oden's [...] "Soon Forgotten", Dixon's [...] "Tiger in Your Tank" [...] and Broonzy's [...] "I Feel So Good". During the latter he performed hip swings, and during [...] "I've Got My Mojo Working", which he played a second time, he performed Elgin movements, then a foxtrot with Cotton. At the end he did a jitterbug; when he returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and performed the move a second time, he received massive cheers from the audience. At the end of this song, every bluesman gathered at the stage to perform medleys of blues standards. Jazz poet and directorate of Newport Langston Hughes spontaneously wrote a finishing song, the slow [...] "Goodbye Newport Blues", this time Spann with as singer, as Waters was too exhausted to perform.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, Vespertine {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} both art and dance music. For example, the instrumentation of choir, strings, and harp is suggestive of Romantic art music, while the [...] "synthesised keyboard sonorities, filtering effects and complex percussive sounds" [...] are elements characteristic of dance-based pop. According to Nicola Dibben: ...the way in which classical and dance-based elements are made to sit alongside one another {{as part of the}} same texture mediates the relationship between the two: the spiritual and the sensual are shown to be compatible, perhaps even suggesting that the sensual is spiritual, and that it can facilitate transcendence and hence grant access to a utopian world. Vespertine is also characterized by [...] "the obsession with sonic traces of analog technology — that is, the pervasive use of loops, static and white noise— despite the obviously digital orientation of twenty-first-century electronics." [...] Unlike previous albums like Debut and Post, [...] "electronic sounds are the norm, and the acoustic sounds become the interjections." [...] Björk's voice is used as a supplement to [...] "the complex electronic textures". Her vocals often appear to be recorded close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and with little treatment, and sung in a sometimes [...] "unstable whisper", conveying a sense of close proximity and reduced space suitable for the intimate lyrics.|$|E
500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] is {{the sixth}} track on the 1985 {{worldwide}} reissue of Like a VIrgin; {{it has never}} been part of Like a Virgin on any North American release. Madonna's inspiration behind the song was the dance floor, and she wrote it while watching a handsome Puerto Rican man across her balcony. Initially written for her friend Mark Kamins, Madonna later decided to use it in the soundtrack of her 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. Unlike the other songs on Like A Virgin, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, and produced by Madonna and Steve Bray. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted that at one point of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing {{with the rest of the}} composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and sang the words [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: [...] " [...] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck." [...] The song consists of instrumentation from drums, percussion, congas and whistles. Madonna's voice is double-tracked in the chorus. The lyrics are simple, and written as an invitation to dance with the singer, with sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning.|$|E
25|$|Microphones are {{categorized}} by their transducer principle, such as condenser, dynamic, etc., {{and by their}} directional characteristics.

30|$|Using a {{sampling}} frequency of 8 kHz, the impulse responses were truncated to 128 samples {{such that the}} adaptive filters could, in theory, perfectly model the impulse responses with the chosen K= 128.

500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from {{an old man who}} said he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice so close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E
