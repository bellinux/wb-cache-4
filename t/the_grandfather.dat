5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a grandfather who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, and desires to give her every luxury. <b>The</b> <b>grandfather</b> turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that luck would favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter with Mrs. Jarley. <b>The</b> <b>grandfather,</b> seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money and proceeds to gamble it away. <b>The</b> <b>grandfather</b> is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her grandfather again. Exhausted and feeble in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet. The schoolmaster takes the two in, but it is too late to save Nell and she dies. Her grandfather is brokenhearted and is found dead on her grave several days later.|$|E

His son Tudur ap Goronwy became a knight in the service of Edward III, and was <b>the</b> <b>grandfather</b> of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur (through his son Maredudd ap Tudur, grandson to Goronwy ap Tudur Hen). Owain Anglicised his name, becoming Owen Tudor, and was himself <b>the</b> <b>grandfather</b> of King Henry VII of England, the founder of the House of Tudor.|$|E

5|$|Jacob (2005) {{attempts}} {{to establish a}} genealogical relationship between Tuisto and Ymir based on etymology and a comparison with (post-)Vedic Indian mythology: as Tvastr, through his daughter Saranyū and her husband Vivaswān, {{is said to have}} been <b>the</b> <b>grandfather</b> of the twins Yama and Yami, so Jacob argues that the Germanic Tuisto (assuming a connection with Tvastr) must originally have been <b>the</b> <b>grandfather</b> of Ymir (cognate to Yama). Incidentally, Indian mythology also places Manu (cognate to Germanic Mannus), the Vedic progenitor of mankind, as a son of Vivaswān, thus making him the brother of Yama/Ymir.|$|E

5000|$|Frank Hayes {{recorded}} a parody version in which <b>the</b> <b>grandfather's</b> wish, expressed in his will, {{is to be}} buried in the clock. Unfortunately the clock is too large to fit through the door of the house, and equally unfortunately <b>the</b> <b>grandfather's</b> body gets stuck inside the clock and cannot be extricated. The song culminates with <b>the</b> dead <b>grandfather</b> standing in <b>the</b> clock, in the house's hallway, [...] "making faces at us" [...] and [...] "ringing the blasted chimes/Ev'ry goddamned night".|$|R

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} works by the bard Iolo Goch was based on Tudur Hen; Iolo may have studied at the Bangor Priory. Tudur Hen's most significant legacy was his name. The naming practice {{of the time in}} Wales was to attach the father's name to the new first name, thus his son was named Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. Goronwy had children, one of whom was named Tudur, becoming another Tudur ap Goronwy. The younger Tudur was noticed by King Edward III of England and was made a knight in his service, and he was <b>the</b> <b>grandfather</b> (through Maredudd ap Tudur) of Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur.

5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} <b>the</b> <b>grandfather</b> {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia.
