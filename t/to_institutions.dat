5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information {{that could not be}} released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice <b>to</b> <b>institutions</b> like the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E

25|$|During the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve {{introduced}} {{a number of}} short-term credit and liquidity facilities to help stabilize markets.

By 1770, Glasgow was the largest linen manufacturer in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Home care {{programs}} are operating throughout Ontario. In October 1975 pilot-test chronic home care (CHC) programs were added in three areas. Whether the Kingston CHC program prevented or delayed admission <b>to</b> an <b>institution</b> providing long-term care was {{studied in the}} 218 patients admitted to the program up to mid-March 1976. Forms were completed for all 218 patients admitted, for the 109 still in the program 6 months later, and for the 131 who had left the program by August 1976. Of the 218 patients 20 % had applied for admission <b>to</b> an <b>institution</b> providing long-term care before applying for CHC, and another 22 % had seriously considered applying <b>to</b> such an <b>institution.</b> The CHC staff judged that 61 % would have needed institutional care without CHC. Only 12 % of the 218 patients left the CHC program <b>to</b> enter an <b>institution,</b> only 1 of the 48 patients discharged to self-care at home was considering a move <b>to</b> an <b>institution,</b> and only 2 receiving CHC for 6 months applied <b>to</b> an <b>institution</b> during that time. CHC therefore seems to delay greatly admission <b>to</b> an <b>institution</b> providing long-term care for a substantial group of patients...|$|R
