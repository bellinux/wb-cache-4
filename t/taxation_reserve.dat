40|$|The paper explores one {{rationale}} behind {{the existence of}} financial repression, with the latter being represented through the obligatory "high" reserve requirement for the banks. Using an overlapping generation production-economy-monetary model characterized {{by the possibility of}} banking crisis, we try and answer whether at all these high reserve requirements are related to discipline the banks. Results indicate that economies with higher probability of banking crisis should optimally choose higher income taxation. The correlation between optimal reserve requirements and probability of crisis is positive only when the social planner has exhausted his ability of income <b>taxation.</b> <b>Reserve</b> requirements; Tax evasion; Information Asymmetry in Financial Markets; Costly state verification. ...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia’s Fourth Post-Program Monitoring discussions {{highlight}} that short-term {{macroeconomic indicators}} and near-term prospects have deteriorated. Financial sector vulnerabilities {{have increased in}} the face of rising interest rates and a slowing economy, but the overall banking sector remains resilient to moderate credit, interest, and depreciation risks. Improved budget execution could help cushion the downturn. Reducing delays in disbursing funds to executing agencies and better project implementation would help offset the expected decline in private consumption.

This is especially true for the following features of corporate taxation: loss compensation, <b>taxation</b> of hidden <b>reserves,</b> financing and transfer pricing. However, some tax rules, particularly the <b>taxation</b> of hidden <b>reserves</b> have not been dealt with in detail in the proposals.|$|R
40|$|Empirical studies {{indicate}} that official reserves increase the creditworthiness of highly indebted countries. This evidence cannot be explained by existing bargaining models of sovereign debt because sovereign immunity shelters official reserves from creditors' seizure. In the model proposed here, to service foreign debt the government must raise revenue through distortionary <b>taxation.</b> Large <b>reserves</b> reduce the fiscal burden of debt service, weakening the bargaining position of the debtor and resulting in larger transfers to foreign creditors. In these circumstances, the debtor country may be better-off repurchasing debt on the secondary market rather than accumulating official reserves.

40|$|Acknowledged by the {{accounting}} regulations {{conform to the}} European directives inside the alternative assessment norms, the revaluation of tangible assets is also accepted by the International Accounting Standards as an allowed alternative treatment. As {{there is a real}} interaction between accountancy and taxation, the present study aims to analyze the fiscal vision on the revaluation, {{the manner in which the}} above mentioned accepts the revaluation of tangible assets. It is a known fact that {{the accounting}} information is used by the taxation as an object and a support in order to determine and to settle the assessments, the taxes and the contributions. Still, the <b>taxation</b> authority <b>reserves</b> the rights to punctually impose some financial treatments distinct to the accounting rules.

5000|$|Julie McDowall of The Herald {{writes that}} the debate started off slowly, but came to life after twelve minutes when Galloway was asked a {{question}} about employment, but chose instead to speak about fiscal matters. Galloway was booed on several occasions. Much of the debate focused on topics relating to <b>taxation,</b> oil <b>reserves,</b> banking, poverty and how to protect NHS Scotland, over which there were some heated exchanges. McDowall also notes that some [...] "comical directions from the stage" [...] were required because of the venue's size. [...] "James Cook had to call for questions from 'the man clapping with your hands in the air' or 'the boy pointing at your own head!'". Writing for The Times about the event 18 months later, Matt Chorley reflected that [...] "The sight of" [...] Galloway, [...] "in his large black fedora telling the audience to ask their grandparents about the Nazis {{became one of the}} most memorable things about the evening".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} inevitable transitions between {{fixed and}} floating exchange-rate regimes in a balance—of—payments model where individual preferences are explicitly specified. The {{goal is to}} assess the analogy between speculative attacks in foreign exchange markets and attacks on official price—fixing schemes in natural resource markets. In discrete time the analogy with resource markets is only partially correct, for in a deterministic model {{the collapse of a}} fixed rate may be characterized by two, successive attacks. The two-attack equilibrium is peculiar to discrete-time analysis, however. In the continuous-time limit of discrete—time models there is a single attack timed so as to rule out an anticipated discrete jump in the exchange rate. Balance—of—payments models differ from nonrenewable resource models in that foreign exchange reserves may be borrowed from abroad. The paper therefore asks whether there are limits to central-bank borrowing possibilities. In an idealized world where all private income is subject to lump—sum <b>taxation,</b> central-bank <b>reserves</b> can become infinitely negative with no violation of the public sector's intertemporal budget constraint. Nonetheless, a growth rate of domestic credit exceeding the world interest rate, if maintained indefinitely, leads to violation of the constraint in the paper's model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a monetary growth {{model in which}} banks provide liquidity, and in which a government finances a deficit by printing money and selling bonds. In this context, I examine {{the possibility that the}} government may want to impose binding reserve requirements on banks' holdings of both money and government bonds. Conditions are established under which doing so increases steady state welfare and reduces the scope for indeterminacies. Furthermore, under a binding system of multiple reserve requirements we have that money is superneutral. On the other hand, if reserve requirements are imposed on cash holdings alone, increases in the steady state inflation rate adversely affect capital accumulation and long run real activity. Thus systems of multiple binding reserve requirements can insulate real activity from the consequences of inflationary <b>taxation.</b> Spatial separation, <b>Reserve</b> requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|Constitutional {{change in}} the UK in 1998 led to the {{establishment}} of devolution for Scotland, and the Scottish Parliament was reconvened in 1999 after a gap of nearly 300 years. Devolution promised the development of policies that were more in tune with ‘Scottish needs’, and was heralded as delivering ‘Scottish solutions for Scottish problems’. Now with a Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) Government in power in Edinburgh committed to greater devolution for Scotland and with a goal of full independence for Scotland, it is timely to assess {{the ways in which the}} SNP have approach the question of social policy – and more specifically poverty and inequality. While key areas of social welfare policy, notable in relation to benefits, employment policy and most areas of <b>taxation</b> remain <b>reserved</b> to the UK parliament in London, the Scottish Parliament enjoys powers over most areas of social policy as they affect Scotland: health, housing, education, community development, regeneration and criminal justice. This paper considers some of the main influences on SNP policy making, and in particular explores its concern to develop policies that promote solidarity, cohesion and fairness. However, these are secondary to a strategy which promotes economic growth and Scottish economic competitiveness. The paper also considers the importance of nationalism for the analysis of social welfare arguing that social policy making is often central to nation building, and particularly so in the context of multi-national devolution of the kind that has developed in the UK and elsewhere in recent times...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} the protracted process of shaping {{the rules governing}} oil operations in São Tomé and PrÃ­ncipe. It analyzes the institutional framework for oil sector development, which applies Milton Friedman''s permanent income hypothesis to the management of oil resources. São Tomé and PrÃ­ncipe is the first country in Africa to adopt this rule. Finally, the paper offers a preliminary quantitative analysis {{of the impact of}} oil sector development on government consumption and savings. It shows that the country''s oil wealth could be significant, which would enable sustainable government consumption and intergenerational equity through a gradual buildup of the Permanent Fund for Future Generations.

5000|$|Justices McLean, Wayne, Catron, McKinley and Grier all concurred {{with the}} {{judgment}} of the United States Supreme Court in both cases. All five of the concurring Justices wrote a concurring opinion. The opinions of McLean and Wayne addressed the various issues which each considered to be implicated in both cases. Catron's opinion addressed only the Smith (New York) case; Grier's opinion addressed only the Norris (Massachusetts) case. Catron and Grier unequivocally joined each other's respective opinions. Wayne also endorsed Catron's and Grier's opinions. McKinley's opinion was limited to a discussion of the First Clause of Section Nine of Article I of the United States Constitution. (McKinley's opinion on this topic was also endorsed by Wayne.) McKinley may be deemed to be joining Grier's opinion (concerning the Norris case) as he stated that such opinion had expressed their [...] "joint views in the cause coming up from Massachusetts" [...] and that the writing of such opinion by Grier [...] "has been done to McKinley's entire satisfaction." [...] As to the various issues involved in the Smith case, McKinley's views require more labor to decipher. McKinley remarked that he had [...] "examined the opinions of ... McLean and ... Catron, and concur with the whole reasoning upon the main question." [...] What McKinley views as that [...] "main question" [...] is not explicated but probably refers to the apparently harmonious views of McLean and Catron concerning the nature of the Commerce Clause and its implications with respect to the <b>reserved</b> <b>taxation</b> and police powers of the States. The sequence in which these concurring opinions appear in the official reports follows the seniority of the respective concurring Justices who authored each opinion.|$|R
