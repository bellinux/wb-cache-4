5|$|The film follows JB (M. G. Ramachandran), {{a wealthy}} {{industrialist}} who goes on vacation to his bungalow in Shimla, {{only to discover}} that his caretaker (Sambandam) and his wife have left for Varanasi after renting the bungalow to a family of three. The rest of the film revolves around JB's response <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> a small, D-shaped stone fortification {{was built}} to protect Fowey Harbour in Cornwall, then an important centre for trade. The harbour was reached through the Fowey estuary, which the local town had protected in the previous century with two blockhouses positioned along the river's edge—the Fowey and Polruan blockhouses—and a boom chain strung between them. The new castle replaced these and was located high on the headland overlooking {{the entrance to the}} estuary itself, St Catherine's Point, from which it took its name.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E

25|$|Jesuits unsuccessfully {{tried to}} peacefully {{assimilate}} the aboriginals into the European culture {{brought by the}} Spanish conquistadores.

25|$|LeChuck's Revenge {{is set in}} the fictitious Tri-Island Area of the Caribbean, {{several months}} after The Secret of Monkey Island.

25|$|With {{the influx}} of foreigners, the {{population}} of non-English speaking foreigners in Singapore offers new challenges {{to the concept of}} language proficiency in the country.

Thus, {{it is not uncommon to}} encounter service staff who are not fluent in English, especially those who do not use English regularly. In response <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation,</b> the Straits Times reported that from July 2010, foreigners working in service sectors would have to pass an English test before they can obtain their work permits.|$|E

25|$|After enjoying {{success at}} the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the electric car began to lose its position in the automobile market. A number of developments contributed <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b> By the 1920s an improved road infrastructure required vehicles with a greater range than that offered by electric cars. Worldwide discoveries of large petroleum reserves led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline, making gas-powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances. Electric cars were limited to urban use by their slow speed (no more than 24–32km/h or 15–20mph.) and low range (30–40 miles or 50–65km), and gasoline cars were now able to travel farther and faster than equivalent electrics.|$|E
25|$|MBO {{situations}} {{lead management}} teams often into a dilemma as {{they face a}} conflict of interest, being interested in a low purchase price personally {{while at the same}} time being employed by the owners who obviously have an interest in a high purchase price. Owners usually react <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> by offering a deal fee to the management team if a certain price threshold is reached. Financial sponsors usually react to this again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the purchase price is low. Another mechanisms to handle this problem are earn-outs (purchase price being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|E
25|$|The Serbian {{victory in}} the First World War was {{supposed}} to serve as compensation <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> {{and there was an}} open debate between the followers of the Greater Serbia doctrine, that defended the incorporation of the parts of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire where Serbs lived to Serbia, opposed by the ones that supported an idea of uniting not only all the Serbian lands, but also to include other South Slav nations into a new country. Among other reasons, but also because of the fear of the creation of a bigger and stronger Orthodox Serbia, that could eventually became a Russian allied, the decision of making an ethnically mixed South Slav state, where other nationalities would balance the Serb hegemony, was made.|$|E

25|$|As Bedouin (nomadic Arabs), most Numayrid emirs avoided settled life in {{the cities}} they controlled; rather, they ruled their emirates (principalities) from their tribal encampments in the countryside, while entrusting {{administration}} of the cities to their ghulams (military slaves). An exception <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> was the emir Mani' ibn Shabib (r. ca. 1044–1063), under whose reign the Numayrids reached their territorial peak. Mani' resided in Harran itself, transforming its Sabian temple into an ornate, fortified palace. The Numayrids were Shia Muslims and initially recognized the religious sovereignty of the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate, at least nominally, but later switched allegiance to the Shia Fatimid Caliphate after the latter extended its rule into northern Syria in 1037. By 1060, they likely reverted to the Abbasids.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{protection}} {{actions are}} geared towards children who {{could potentially be}} trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and conditional cash transfer programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the I.L.O, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Another way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities {{from all over the}} world dedicating a week <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b> Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.|$|E

Meanwhile, House begins to regret recruiting former CIA doctor Samira Terzi (Michael Michele) when she fails to demonstrate the intelligence he witnessed at Langley. Wilson, who believes that House is being distracted by Terzi's looks, offers up the solution to quickly fire her and then ask her out on a date. He also notes House's propensity to hire attractive women, which led him <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>situation.</b> House argues that he's [...] "not that guy"; Wilson retorts [...] "every guy is that guy". During the episode the film crew also interviews Cameron, asking why she resigned and making it look like she was romantically attracted to House.|$|E

30|$|The {{importance}} {{of an alternative}} approach <b>to</b> redress <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> has also been identified in this research. When two distant nodes named N 1 and N 2 of different networks come within communication range of each other, they exchange their MANET identities.
