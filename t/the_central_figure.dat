5|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> shines {{a single}} small star {{at the very}} top of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> herself. The {{distance}} of the star from <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure,</b> and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Altar 4 is a {{circular}} monument. It {{was also found}} {{in the northern part of}} the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4. It depicts three seated prisoners, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him. Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of the altar. The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Disney remains <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in {{the history}} of animation. Through {{technological}} innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the college's {{incorporation}} was Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence, who sought an institution that would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island.|$|E
5|$|Modifications and {{expansions}} {{on several}} traditional royal rituals under Andrianampoinimerina {{enabled him to}} develop a state religion {{in which he was}} <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure.</b> The tradition of the fandroana festival established by the 17th century Merina king Ralambo was made a much larger event intended to symbolically renew the nation and the cosmic power that legitimized and strengthened Andrianampoinimerina's reign as well as the power of the state. This served to further unify his citizens while legitimizing and strengthening his rule.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-82 is {{the northernmost}} {{structure}} adjoining the East Platform. The {{first version of}} this building {{was built in the}} 4th century AD.

40|$|The {{presentation}} of the heroes and heroines in Ibsen's early, middle and later plays is undeniably different. In the early plays, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> as represented by Brand and Peer Gynt, stand as super human beings who in following their extreme desires perform all the incredible deeds in their own imaginative worlds. In the middle plays, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> as represented by Nora, Mrs. Alving and Dr. Stockrnann are the midelle class people who struggle against the false values of society for truth and freedom. And in the later plays, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> as represented by Solness, Borkman and Rubek, are mystical frustrated <b>central</b> <b>figures,</b> who gain triumph over their wasted lives through their death. However, beyond all the differences there is one characteristic that makes all Ibsen's <b>central</b> <b>figures</b> similar to one another. The similarity that unites all these <b>central</b> <b>figures</b> {{is that all of}} them stand as individuals...|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} natural philosopher, a forerunner {{of the modern}} scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's air pump experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, {{but for most of}} the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on {{the left of the}} canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E

5|$|Chancellor Law's Fountain – Unveiled in May 1871, the {{fountain}} was sculpted by Turner and Allen of London. The lions {{are made from}} Ashlar stone and <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> is sculpted iron. The fountain {{was a gift from}} James Thomas Law who was the chancellor of the diocese and gave much to the city, including the statue of Samuel Johnson in the market square. The fountain is located at the centre of the Museum Gardens. In 2011 {{the fountain}} was restored with funding from Lichfield Conduit Lands Trust.|$|E
5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), or simply a victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E
5|$|Inspection under {{infrared}} {{has revealed}} that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions. The legs of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which infrared shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E

5|$|Jesus is <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> of Christianity. Although Christian {{views of}} Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah was <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was}} based on Jinnah's life and his {{struggle}} for the creation of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Alexander Gordon Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet (20 July 1848– 20 May 1930) was a Scottish landowner, soldier, adventurer and socialite. A notorious womaniser, he is {{best known}} for being <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the royal baccarat scandal of 1891. After inheriting a baronetcy he joined the Army and saw service in South Africa, Egypt and the Sudan; he served with {{distinction}} and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> {{waving to}} the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848– January 13, 1929) was an American Old West gambler, {{a deputy}} sheriff in Pima County, and deputy town marshal in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, {{who took part}} in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys. He is often mistakenly {{regarded}} as <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> in the shootout in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal that day, and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
