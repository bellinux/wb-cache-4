5|$|In 2009, {{with the}} {{production}} beginning to coalesce, Scorsese and a production crew went to Nagasaki, Japan, visiting the original sites {{that served as the}} setting for Endō's novel. Additional location scouting was conducted in Canada. However, Silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards, and Scorsese decided to work on Shutter Island and Hugo instead. In December 2011, Scorsese stated <b>that</b> <b>Silence</b> would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it on the back burner and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of Silence. However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated <b>that</b> <b>Silence</b> would come first. In May, the film picked up another producer in the recently revived Cecchi Gori Pictures, which placed the project first on its slate of upcoming films. Cecchi Gori was involved in pre-production for Silence, but years of unrelated legal disputes had interrupted its association to the film.|$|E
5|$|Goldsman took on {{the project}} as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to {{distance}} the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, {{as well as from}} the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> could be very effective cinema.|$|E
25|$|Thomas is {{well known}} for his reticence during oral argument. Beginning when he asked a {{question}} during a death penalty case on February 22, 2006, Thomas had not asked another question from the bench for more than ten years, finally asking a question on February 29, 2016, about a response to a question regarding whether persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence should be barred permanently from firearm possession. He also had a nearly seven-year streak of not speaking at all in any context, finally breaking <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> on January 14, 2013, when he was understood to have joked that a law degree from Yale may be proof of incompetence.|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported repeat-induced gene silencing (RIGS) in Arabidopsis, in which transgene expression may be silenced epigenetically when repeated sequences are present. Among an allelic series of lines comprising a primary transformant and various recombinant progeny carrying different numbers of drug resistance gene copies {{at the same}} locus, silencing was found to depend strictly on repeated sequences and to correlate with an absence of steady-state mRNA. We now report characterization, in nuclei isolated from the same transgenic lines, of gene expression by nuclear run-on assay and of chromatin structure by nuclease protection assay. We find <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> is correlated with absence of run-on transcripts, indicating <b>that</b> expression is <b>silenced</b> {{at the level of}} transcription. We find further <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> is also correlated with increased resistance to both DNase I and micrococcal nuclease, indicating <b>that</b> the <b>silenced</b> state reflects a change in chromatin configuration. We propose <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> results when a locally paired region of homologous repeated nucleotide sequences is flanked by unpaired heterologous DNA, which leads chromatin to adopt a local configuration that is difficult to transcribe, and possibly akin to heterochromatin...|$|R
40|$|I argue <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> (the act of {{preventing}} someone from communicating, broadly construed) {{can be an}} act of both interpersonal and institutional violence. My argument has two main steps. First, I follow others in analyzing violence as violation of integrity and show that undermining someone’s capacities as a knower can be such a violation. Second, I argue <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> someone can violate their epistemic capacities in that way. I conclude by exploring when silencing someone might be morally justifiable, even if doing so is an act of violence...|$|R
500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{narrative}} {{qualities of the}} film, the filmmaking was also praised for the depth and thoroughness of its thematic content. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, who assigned it 3½ stars out of four, wrote <b>that</b> <b>Silence</b> [...] "offers frustratingly few answers but all the right questions" [...] and argued that it is among the director's [...] "most spiritually moving films to date". In Slant, Jesse Cataldo argued, [...] "Tapping into the vast pool of vagueness and uncertainty that exists beneath the veneer of a rigid, righteous belief, Scorsese crafts a versatile, multifaceted work that encourages serious reflection and contemplation." [...] Alissa Wilkinson of Vox wrote <b>that</b> <b>Silence</b> [...] "is beautiful, unsettling {{and one of the}} finest religious movies ever made". John Ehrett of The Federalist praised the film highly, saying, [...] "Silence is a must-see masterpiece about the paradoxes of faith." [...] Ehrett further added, [...] "Complex yet reverent, Silence explores the meanings and dilemmas of Christian faith, and decisively sets a new benchmark for religious films." ...|$|E
500|$|Although giving [...] "sporadic" [...] {{comments}} {{during the}} interview, no answers {{had been given}} that touched upon the case. The Court had not previously considered [...] "whether a suspect can invoke {{the right to remain}} silent by remaining uncooperative and nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes" [...] and the dissent considered <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> throughout a lengthy interrogation [...] "long past the point when he could be deciding whether to respond cannot reasonably be understood other than as an invocation of the right to remain silent". Butler also distinguished between a [...] "sufficient course of conduct" [...] and mere [...] "inculpatory statements".|$|E
500|$|The film also {{garnered}} criticism. Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge found major flaws {{with the}} film, writing, [...] "Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging {{at some of}} its most critical moments. It is too subdued for Scorsese-philes, too violent for the most devout, and too abstruse for the great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian stated in his review, [...] "I fear <b>that</b> <b>Silence</b> expired in the womb during that long gestation period. It is beautiful to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (to say nothing of over-long; Masahiro Shinoda's 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō's 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese). Perhaps that leap toward the devout is needed to savour it fully–and I found I couldn't make it." ...|$|E

500|$|Caesar A. Montevecchio of the University of Notre Dame {{published}} a theological {{assessment of the}} spiritual themes in the film concentrating on the act of priestly renunciation depicted towards the end stating: [...] "This climactic scene of Rodrigues trampling the fumie makes clear <b>that</b> <b>Silence</b> {{is as much about}} the object of Christian faith as it is the experience of that faith. As ambient and live sound are washed out entirely, Rodrigues hears the voice of Christ telling him to trample, that it was to be trampled upon that Christ came into the world. The object of faith becomes a Christ who is a hero of pity, who takes up the weakness and suffering of humankind as his cross, rather than a hero of triumphant resolve. The Jesus of Silence is one of utter kenosis (self-emptying), and one who in the mercy of that kenosis radically sympathizes with the weakness, and frailty, of human beings, even ones like Judas and Kichijiro." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that something did go on but <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but those who read ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his visit}} to Sicily in November 1994, Pope John Paul II praised Puglisi as a [...] "courageous {{exponent}} of the Gospel."

[...] Tutu compared these detentions to those under Apartheid. Tutu also emphasised that when South Africa had used those methods the country had been condemned; however when powerful countries such as Britain and the United States of America had invoked such power, the world was silent and in <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> accepted their methods even though the left charged that they violated essential human rights.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court in Maryland v. West Virginia also {{applied a}} legal {{principle}} known as [...] "prescription" [...] to the boundary dispute. The concept of prescription {{is based on}} the idea that a state or individual's uninterrupted possession to land creates a claim on that land. The assumption of the courts has been that a state or person will seek to possess that which is his, and <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> and/or neglect to regain possession indicates the original owner's intent to relinquish the land. Maryland v. West Virginia is considered a classic case where the doctrine of prescription is applied. Although some legal scholars have attempted to provide criteria which would trigger prescription (e.g., 50 years of uninterrupted possession), in Maryland v. West Virginia the Supreme Court held that such decisions must be intensively fact-specific.|$|E
2500|$|Film critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert each awarded it 3.5 stars out of {{a maximum}} of 4 stars. Ebert stated in his review, [...] "It {{illustrates}} {{one of my favorite}} points, <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x. For extended periods here, nothing at all is happening, and believe me, you won't be bored." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave Paranormal Activity an A− rating and called it [...] "frightening...freaky and terrifying" [...] and said that [...] "Paranormal Activity scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clichés." [...] Bloody Disgusting ranked the film 16th in their list of the [...] "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article saying, [...] "Peli deserves props for milking the maximum amount of tension out of the spare, modern setting—an ordinary, cookie-cutter tract home in San Diego. It doesn't sound very scary, but Peli manages to make it terrifying. If you aren't white-knuckling your armrest at least once or twice while watching it, you probably don't have a pulse." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There is {{a growing}} demand for the {{development}} of experimental strategies for efficient articular cartilage repair. Current tissue engineering-based regenerative strategies make use of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). However, when implanted in a cartilage defect, control of hMSCs differentiation toward the chondrogenic lineage remains a significant challenge. We have recently demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> the antichondrogenic regulator microRNA- 221 (miR- 221) was highly effective in promoting in vitro chondrogenesis of monolayered hMSCs {{in the absence of the}} chondrogenic induction factor TGF-β. Here we investigated the feasibility of this approach first in conventional 3 D pellet culture and then in an in vivo model. In pellet cultures, we observed <b>that</b> miR- 221 <b>silencing</b> was sufficient to drive hMSCs toward chondrogenic differentiation in the absence of TGF-β. In vivo, the potential of miR- 221 silenced hMSCs was investigated by first encapsulating the cells in alginate and then by filling a cartilage defect in an osteochondral biopsy. After implanting the biopsy subcutaneously in nude mice, we found <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> of miR- 221 strongly enhanced in vivo cartilage repair compared to the control conditions (untreated hMSCs or alginate-only). Notably, miR- 221 silenced hMSCs generated in vivo a cartilaginous tissue with no sign of collagen type X deposition, a marker of undesired hypertrophic maturation. Altogether our data indicate <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> miR- 221 has a prochondrogenic role in vivo, opening new possibilities for the use of hMSCs in cartilage tissue engineering...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} identified 28 cofactors {{through which}} a RAS oncoprotein directs transcriptional silencing of Fas and other tumor suppressor genes (TSGs).

RNAi and pharmacological inhibition experiments reveal <b>that</b> <b>silencing</b> requires continuous function of RAS and its cofactors {{and can be}} rapidly reversed, which may have therapeutic implications for reactivation of silenced TSGs in RAS-positive cancers...|$|R
