40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} distinctive significance of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> during <b>the</b> Song dynasty (960 – 1279) through its various literary and visual representations. Simply speaking, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> was an enclosed site specifically used for reading, writing, and art creation. Pre-Song texts have records {{of a few}} early examples of studio sites in China. However, {{it was during the}} Song dynasty that <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> became a prominent cultural space for literati. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> became both an object of scholarly representation and the medium through which the literatus’ everyday practices were effected. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> served as a medium for the reproduction of literati culture itself. This dissertation concentrates on the spatiality of this medium. I argue that in Song literary representations, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> was a porous private space: on the one hand, it provided a confined space for personal practices and self-cultivation; on the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> was open to limited public interactions and was an emblematic display of literati self-identity. 	The main body of this dissertation is divided into five chapters. The first chapter traces the evolution of the literary configuration of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> till <b>the</b> Song dynasty, to demonstrate the pivotal role that Song literature played in the construction of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> space. Chapter two tackles the issue of how <b>the</b> represented <b>studio</b> worked as a private space for Song literati. However, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> was a mostly private space {{in the sense that it}} also allowed for limited interactions and was used for display. Hence, in the third chapter, I argue that <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> can also work as a particular kind of social space. Chapter four analyzes the porous privacy of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> from another dimension, the interrelationship among literati, scholarly objects, and <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> <b>The</b> last chapter examines <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> in its relation to the exterior space—the interplay between <b>the</b> cultural <b>studio</b> and its natural surroundings in literary and pictorial representations...|$|R

It {{then began}} serialisation {{over the border}} in France, in that country's edition of the magazine, from 11 May 1950. During this time, there were changes to how Hergé conducted his work; on 6 April 1950, he established Studios Hergé as a public company. <b>The</b> <b>Studios</b> were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine's main abode. <b>The</b> <b>Studios</b> would provide both personal support to Hergé and technical support for his ongoing work.

5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} <b>the</b> <b>studios,</b> {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. <b>The</b> <b>studios</b> were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to <b>the</b> <b>studios.</b> Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production and advise <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> when changes or cuts were required.|$|E
