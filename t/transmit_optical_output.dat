40|$|We report {{time domain}} {{observations}} of optical instability in high Q silicon nitride whispering gallery disk resonators. At low laser power the <b>transmitted</b> <b>optical</b> power through the disk looks chaotic. At higher power, the <b>optical</b> <b>output</b> settles into a stable self-pulsing regime with periodicity ranging {{from hundreds of}} milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. This phenomenon is explained by the interplay between a fast thermo-optic nonlinearity within the disk and a slow thermo-mechanic nonlinearity of the structure. A model for this interplay is developed which provides good agreement with experimental data and points out routes to control this instability...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{relative}} humidity (RH) sensor is demonstrated using a tapered fiber with an hydrogel coating. Hydroxyethylcellulose/polyvinylidenefluoride polymers {{are used to}} form the hydrogel coating of the tapered fiber as they are sensitive to moisture and thus the humidity of the atmosphere. Changes in humidity level alter the refractive index of the fiber coating and this condition leads to variation in <b>optical</b> <b>output</b> power. A difference of up to 0. 89 dB of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>optical</b> power is observed when RH changes from 50 to 80 %. The proposed sensor has a sensitivity of about 0. 0228 dB/%RH with a slope linearity of more than 99. 91 %. In summary, the hydrogel coating acts as an inner cladding whose refractive index decreases with the rise in humidity and thus allows more light to be transmitted in humid state...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the upper}} and lower bounds for the channel {{capacity}} of dimmable visible light communications(VLC) systems are investigated. Because the information is modulated into the instantaneous <b>optical</b> intensity, the <b>transmitted</b> <b>optical</b> intensity is represented by a nonnegative input that is corrupted by an additive white Gaussian noise. Considering the illumination support in a VLC system, the <b>transmitted</b> <b>optical</b> intensity signal must satisfy the illumination constraint, i. e., the average <b>transmitted</b> <b>optical</b> intensity is constrained by a target illumination intensity, which is determined by the nominal optical intensity of the light source devices and dimming target. An upper bound on the channel capacity is derived based on the signal space geometry via a sphere packing argument. A lower bound on the channel capacity is derived by maximizing the mutual information between the channel input and output. Both {{the upper and}} lower bounds are presented in closed forms. Furthermore, a closed-form optimal intensity distribution of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>optical</b> signal is obtained.

30|$|The {{improvement}} of <b>optical</b> <b>output</b> power for LEDs with Au-coated SACNT thin film {{was due to}} the sheet resistance competition with the p-GaP, although there existed about 20 % optical transmittance loss. According to the estimation, the sheet resistance of p-GaP in this experiment is about 300 to 500 Ω. When the Au-coated SACNT thin film was put on the p-GaP, lots of carriers could spread outside the opaque metal electrode, which could have the possibility to contribute to the <b>optical</b> <b>output</b> power. The 2 -nm-thick Au coating on the SACNTs could form the Au nanowire which may induce an interacting electromagnetic field with multiple quantum wells (MQWs). However, this interaction is a near-field effect. Considering the distance between of Au nanowire and quantum wells in this experiment, output enhancement due to the surface plasmon resonance can be ignored. So further decreasing the sheet resistance and improvement the optical transmittance of the current-spreading layer of SACNT thin film could increase the <b>optical</b> <b>output</b> power.|$|R
