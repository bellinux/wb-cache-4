40|$|New acts of 25 Sept. 1981 have {{substantially}} {{changed the}} legal {{position of a}} State enterprise director. It concerns mainly the situation of a director as the managing organ and as the representative of an enterprise. His proffessional status has also changed. This a resulting, among others, from vesting the employees' council with the competence to appoint and recall the director. A minister supervising the enterprise, called the founding organ, is vested with the same authority. Both organs mentioned above enjoy a reciprocal right <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>objection</b> against decided acts of appointing or recalling the director. Trying the objection is a subject of competence of a law court. Several additional elements consolidating the professional status of the director are created in the new regulation. In particular he is protected against a groundless dismissal. Judicial control of acts of appointing and recalling the director can contribute to limiting as yet arbitrary decisions in nominating for that office. Wide competence of the worker's councils in cases concerning appointing and recalling directors of enterprises are laying grounds for the effective social control of managing and directing processes in State enterprises.

40|$|The Kronoply/Kronotex appeal {{offers the}} ECJ an {{opportunity}} to revisit the conditions applicable to challenge decisions not <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>objections</b> {{in the context of}} the state aids monitoring procedure. These conditions were defined in the Cook and Matra judgments but were not applied consistently in the subsequent case law. After the mentioned appeal, the conditions for private parties, wishing to challenge a decision not <b>raise</b> <b>objection,</b> are the following: they need to prove to be ‘parties concerned’ by the contested decision. This notion is interpreted broadly. Moreover, they should claim that their procedural rights were breached. However, there is no need for these applicants to prove to be ‘directly and individually’ concerned by the decision, within the meaning of the Plaumann/Cofaz case law, and they can use any argument to prove that the Commission wrongly assessed the draft aid measure. This implies that the Kronoply appeal eases the position of private applicants. Two possible consequences of the judgment are the increase of the litigation against decisions not <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>objections</b> and the reduction of the Commission’s considerable discretion in the area of state aid...|$|R

5000|$|A closing argument, summation, or {{summing up}} is the {{concluding}} statement of each party's counsel reiterating the important arguments for the trier of fact, often the jury, in a court case. A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence. A closing argument may not contain any new information and may only use evidence introduced at trial. It is not customary <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>objections</b> during closing arguments, except for egregious behavior. [...] However, such objections, when made, can prove critical later {{in order to preserve}} appellate issues.|$|R

The Muslims said the land belonged to the WAKF board. In March 2015, the Faridabad court ruled in favour of the Muslim community.

On the other hand, if he were accepted, anyone who thought his claims insufficient had the right of instituting judicial proceedings against him. If the decision was adverse, he would lose his office and be further liable to punishment depending on the offence—which could be, for instance, that of unlawfully assuming the rights of a citizen.|$|R
