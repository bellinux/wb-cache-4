The marble staircase and vaulting was rebuilt, while the cornerstones were cleaned. Little was accomplished until 1987, when further repairs to <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> <b>and</b> ceiling of <b>the</b> narthex, including to the architrave, capitals and columns. The following year there was {{reconstruction of the}} nave.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s and 2000s the {{building}} underwent further structural repairs, including {{the replacement of}} the timber structure supporting <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> was rethatched with grant aid from English Heritage.

50|$|The {{sandstone}} {{building is}} severely discolored {{due to the}} polluted air from the surrounding steel factories and heavy traffic. In 1950 during a ferocious snowstorm, the top floor collapsed, destroying <b>the</b> ornate <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> tower. Instead of reconstructing <b>the</b> mansard <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> tower, <b>the</b> county officials decided to keep <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> flat, cutting <b>the</b> number of floors to five.|$|R
5|$|Bellew's Gartership also {{witnessed}} {{changes to}} {{the fabric of the}} College of Arms. Although it had survived the Blitz, structural problems with <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> brickwork forced the heralds to decide between leaving the College's buildings on Queen Victoria Street or attempting expensive repairs. In 1954, they approached the Ministry of Works to ask for financial assistance in the building work; the Ministry agreed to cover half the cost. A successful public appeal for the remaining funds followed and the restoration work carried out. The College of Arms Trust was established in 1956 to oversee funds for the building's maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused {{the surface of the}} frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, a {{landmine}} exploded {{near the}} south {{aisle of the}} cathedral, resulting in {{the roof of the}} nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> <b>and</b> made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti had added to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E

Several additional buildings were demolished, including city hall, St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Church.

The final tornado, an F0, produced minor damage to the East Hartland fire station.|$|E
5|$|Meare Pool was drained {{after the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries {{and the fish}} house fell into disrepair. It {{suffered}} {{a fire in the}} 1880s, which destroyed <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> gutted the interior. In 1893 some repairs were made to the walls, although the roof was not replaced until work was undertaken by the Ministry of Works in the 1920s, with further conservation being carried out in the 1960s. A piece of timber from the building was subject to dendrochronology testing in an attempt to provide a more specific date for the buildings construction, but the results proved inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|Passenger service {{along the}} Wallkill Valley line ceased in 1937, {{due to the}} {{increased}} usage of automobiles. By December 1958 the building (then owned by the New York Central Railroad) was no longer used as a railroad station. It was sold off in 1959, and hosted a number of local endeavors, serving as a chapter house for the Knights of Columbus and as an office for a public-access television station. Under the ownership of the television station, <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> floorboards were repaired.|$|E

Amongst other assistance provided they restored <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> power to the ports hospital and repaired the leprosarium at Befaria, near Diego-Suarez.

5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>and</b> crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
