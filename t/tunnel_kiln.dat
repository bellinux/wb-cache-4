5|$|The {{shale oil}} {{industry}} at Kohtla-Järve and Kiviõli was redeveloped. In 1945, the first <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> was restored, {{and by the}} end of the 1940s four tunnel kilns located in Kiviõli and Kohtla-Nõmme had been restored. German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour. Between 1946 and 1963, 13Kiviter-type retorts were built in Kohtla-Järve and eight in Kiviõli. In 1947, a pilot Galoter retort was built at the Ilmarine engineering plant in Tallinn. This unit, in operation until 1956, was capable of processing 2.5tonnes of oil shale per day and was used for modelling the next generation of commercial-scale retorts. The first Galoter-type commercial-scale pilot retorts were built at Kiviõli in 1953 and 1963 with capacities of 200 and 500tonnes of oil shale per day, respectively. The first of these retorts closed in 1963 and the second in 1981. The Narva Oil Plant, annexed to the Eesti Power Station and operating two Galoter-type 3,000-tonnes-per day retorts, was commissioned in 1980. Started as a pilot plant, the process of converting it to a commercial-scale plant took about 20years.|$|E

2500|$|Gladding, McBean & Co.’s ware {{would be}} {{produced}} in a new patented earthenware clay body known as Malinite. Dr. Andrew Malinovsky developed the high talc one-fire body using an amorphous flux in 1928 for Gladding, McBean & Co. Malinite was developed {{for use in the}} production of one-fire clay tile; however the company made the decision to use Malinite for their dinnerware production. By using the Malinite and adjusting the kiln temperature for a one fire process, the company solved the crazing problem in their own product. Glaze was applied to the unfired body, and the glaze and body matured together in the kiln, saving the company the time and expense of separate bisque firing for the body. [...] For the new line of pottery, Gladding, McBean & Co. decided to use Prouty tunnel kilns. The Prouty <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> patents were acquired in the purchase of the West Coast holdings of the American Encaustic Tiling Company in 1933. Prouty tunnel kilns allowed for the continuous flow of ware through the kiln to fire pottery. Thus the plant “combined mills, jiggering units, conveyors, dryers and kilns into a model of straight line output.” ...|$|E

Another company, Punchbowl Brick and Pipe Company Pty. Ltd., is purchased. In 1961, Brickworks Limited is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and a new plant in Wallgrove is opened. In 1965, three <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> were in full operation at the Wallgrove site. Then in 1965, a second plant in Wallgrove was opened, and additional kilns were built in 1969 to handle the demand for production. (A third plant at Wallgrove follows shortly in 1972). In 1969, Brickworks entered into a cross-holding agreement with Washington H. Soul Pattinson (WHSP).|$|R

50|$|The <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> {{produced}} 70% of the country's {{gas fire}} radiants (white ceramic grills that {{sit in the}} front of many domestic gas fires) in the mid 20th century and was difficult to visualise from the archaeological evidence alone. The digital reconstruction has assisted in understanding how the technology worked. The later design of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> enabled continuous firing thereby minimising delays while waiting for it to cool before loading and unloading. The product was slowly passed through a central chamber using gas to fire it.|$|E

50|$|Potters were {{attracted}} to the Ger area due to the availability of clay and wood. In the 18th century, potters formed associations around large <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns,</b> and by the 19th century there were 21 such associations in the Ger area employing 700 people. The museum {{is located in the}} restored buildings of Le Placitre, a pottery production site that was run by the Véron and Esneu families. When ceramics were largely replaced by other materials in the early 20th century, pottery manufacture died out in Ger. In 1988, the Conseil général de la Manche invested in restoration of Le Placitre buildings and in archaeological research. The museum opened to the public in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Tunnels totalling 200 metres {{in length}} radiate from a chalk pit which also {{contains}} a disused lime <b>kiln,</b> and the <b>tunnels</b> and <b>kiln</b> are used by five species of bat for hibernation between September and April, and the surrounding vegetation helps to maintain a suitable micro-climate in the caves.

40|$|Carbon {{footprint}} is {{broadly defined}} as carbon dioxide (CO 2 center dot) emissions normalized per unit mass {{of a product}} or per unit of an activity. It is considered as an important environmental indicator for comparing various products or activities. Fired solid clay brick is a popular walling material in India. Manufacturing of fired clay bricks involves combustion of fossil fuels during the firing process and during other unit operations and activities. Due to combustion of fossil fuels, dissociation of mineral calcite in the soil during the firing of green bricks and combustion of diesel during transportation of raw materials, the greenhouse gas emissions {{are associated with the}} manufacturing of fired clay bricks. About 250 billion bricks are manufactured annually in India. To fire the green bricks, mainly two types of brick kilns are used in India: Bull's trench kiln and Clamp kilns. The Bull's trench kilns are mainly used in northern and central India whereas the clamps are used in peninsular India. In the present study, carbon footprint of bricks manufactured in the clamps of a major clamp cluster in peninsular India is estimated and is compared with that of bricks manufactured in other types of kilns in India. Karad, District Satara, Maharashtra (India) located in peninsular India has a major cluster of clamp type brick kilns which has more than 300 clamp kiln sites with annual production of approximately 120 million bricks. A field survey of the clamps of Karad is conducted to collect the data about use of soil, fuels and water and its transportation. The CO 2 emissions due to various unit operations and activities in a typical clamp are estimated using guidelines provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These total emissions are normalized per unit mass of fired brick and are presented as carbon footprint of a brick. The statistical mean of the carbon footprints of bricks manufactured in all the surveyed clamps is presented as the carbon footprint of bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad. The average carbon footprint of the bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad is estimated as 195 g CO 2 /kg of fired brick and 162 g CO 2 /kg of fired brick respectively, when the CO 2 emissions due to the combustion of biofuels and transportation of raw materials are included or excluded. This is comparable to the carbon footprint of the other popular brick-making technologies, and defies the common notion that clamps are highly inefficient. The carbon footprint of bricks manufactured in the clamps of Karad is lower than that reported for the clay bricks manufactured in <b>tunnel</b> <b>kilns</b> in the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom.

This new pottery came to Japan alongside immigrants from Korea, possibly southern Korea which was under attack from Goguryeo.|$|E
5000|$|... 2015 was the bi-centenary of {{the opening}} of the Worcester and Birmingham canal (1815-2015). This {{connected}} Birmingham to Worcester and the River Severn, and then to Gloucester with its International trade routes. The speed with which the canal system was constructed is phenomenal, perhaps due to the war with France that began in 1793, and the need to transport the heavy minerals - coal, iron-ore, and limestone from the Black Country. Selly Port was the centre of activity.The Worcester and Birmingham Canal Act of 1791 approved the construction and with two further Acts authorised the raising of £379,609 to pay for it. Barracks to accommodate the navvies at were established Bournbrook for 120 men, and Gallows Brook, Stirchley for 100 men. Between Selly Oak and Ley End to the south of the Wast Hill <b>Tunnel</b> six brick <b>kilns</b> were in operation. The network included three canals: the Worcester-Birmingham, the Netherton, or Dudley Canal line No. 2, and the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal.|$|R
5000|$|They are {{one type}} of [...] "cross-draught" [...] kilns, where the flames travel more or less horizontally, rather than up from or down to the floor. The kilns were {{normally}} made of brick; sometimes most of the structure was dug out below the loess soil, with only the dome and chimney protruding above ground. In either case the interior was normally lined with a refractory fireclay. In some cases, especially in later periods, the fire box was approached by a <b>tunnel.</b> Initially the <b>kilns</b> were fired with wood, but during the Northern Song period (960-1127) {{there was a general}} switch to coal, easily found in north China, which required a smaller fire box, but the introduction of saggars to protect the pieces from gritty coal ash. This changed the reducing quality of the atmosphere during firing, which affected the colours of various wares, wood giving a reducing atmosphere and coal an oxidizing one. A firing might take as long as two weeks, including the cooling time.|$|R

50|$|Clinkers {{consist of}} bits and ends, field-late and white-burning or red-burning clays. Through {{different}} mixtures {{of the raw}} ingredients, many varied colour nuances can be achieved. For the production of masonry units the source materials—clay and water—are mixed and formed industrially in a string extrusion process. For special purposes, for example the restoration of listed buildings, hand-formed clinkers are used. During the drying process, the water concentration decreases to approximately 3%. Then clinkers are fired at temperatures between 1100 °C and 1300 °C in a <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln</b> (earlier in ring kilns), {{in contrast to the}} 800 °C to 1200 °C temperature range seen with normal bricks.|$|E
5000|$|A {{continuous}} kiln, {{sometimes called}} a <b>tunnel</b> <b>kiln,</b> {{is a long}} structure in which only the central portion is directly heated. From the cool entrance, ware is slowly transported through the kiln, and its temperature is increased steadily as it approaches the central, hottest part of the kiln. From there, it continues through the kiln, and the surrounding temperature is reduced until it exits the kiln nearly at room temperature. A continuous kiln is energy-efficient, because heat given off during cooling is recycled to pre-heat the incoming ware. In some designs, the ware is left in one place, while the heating zone moves across it. Kilns in this type include: ...|$|E

50|$|Shuttle Kilns: {{this is a}} car-bottom kiln with a door on one or both ends. Burners are {{positioned}} top and bottom on each side, creating a turbulent circular air flow. This type of kiln is generally a multi-car design and is used for processing whitewares, technical ceramics and refractories in batches. Depending upon size and mass of ware, shuttle kilns may be equipped with car moving devices to transfer fired and unfired ware {{in and out of}} the kiln. Shuttle kilns can be either updraft or downdraft in design.
