5|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the New Guinea crocodile native to Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea, and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the New Guinea crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their <b>two</b> <b>samples</b> for the New Guinea crocodile, one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{abnormal}} DNA methylation in {{the progression of}} disease is a growing area of research that relies upon the establishment of sound statistical methods. The common method for declaring there is differential methylation between two groups at a given CpG site, as summarized by the difference between proportions methylated db=b 1 -b 2, has been through use of a Filtered <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test, using the recommended filter of 0. 17 (Bibikova et al., 2006 b). In this dissertation, we performed a re-analysis of the data used in recommending the threshold by fitting a mixed-effects ANOVA model. It was determined that the 0. 17 filter is not accurate and conjectured that application of a Filtered <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test likely leads to loss of power. Further, the <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test assumes that data arise from an underlying distribution encompassing the entire real number line, whereas b 1 and b 2 are constrained on the interval. Additionally, {{the imposition of a}} filter at a level signifying the minimum level of detectable difference to a <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test likely reduces power for smaller but truly differentially methylated CpG sites. Therefore, we compared the <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test and the Filtered <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test, which are widely used but largely untested with respect to their performance, to three proposed methods. These three proposed methods are a Beta distribution test, a Likelihood ratio test, and a Bootstrap test, where each was designed to address distributional concerns present in the current testing methods. It was ultimately shown through simulations comparing Type I and Type II error rates that the (unfiltered) <b>Two</b> <b>Sample</b> t-test and the Beta distribution test performed comparatively well...|$|R

40|$|The present {{disclosure}} describes micromechanical {{devices and}} methods for using such devices for characterizing a material's strength. The micromechanical devices include an anchor pad, a top shuttle platform, a nanoindenter in movable {{contact with the}} top shuttle platform and at least <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> stage shuttles. The nanoindenter applies a compression force to the top shuttle platform, and the at least <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> stage shuttles move apart {{in response to the}} compression force. Each of the at least <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> stage shuttles is connected to the top shuttle platform and to the anchor pad by at least one inclined beam. Methods for using the devices include connecting a sample between the at least <b>two</b> <b>sample</b> stage shuttles and applying a compression force to the top shuttle platform. Application of the compression force to the top shuttle platform results in a tensile force being applied to the sample. Measuring a tip displacement of the nanoindenter is correlated with the sample's strength. Illustrative materials that can be studied using the micromechanical devices include, for example, nanotubes, nanowires, nanorings, nanocomposites and protein fibrils...|$|R

25|$|Two-color microarrays or two-channel microarrays are {{typically}} hybridized with cDNA prepared from <b>two</b> <b>samples</b> {{to be compared}} (e.g. diseased tissue versus healthy tissue) and that are labeled with two different fluorophores. Fluorescent dyes commonly used for cDNA labeling include Cy3, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570nm (corresponding to the green part of the light spectrum), and Cy5 with a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670nm (corresponding to the red part of the light spectrum). The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed and hybridized to a single microarray that is then scanned in a microarray scanner to visualize fluorescence of the two fluorophores after excitation with a laser beam of a defined wavelength. Relative intensities of each fluorophore may then be used in ratio-based analysis to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes.|$|E

25|$|When using RFLP, the {{theoretical}} {{risk of a}} coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures {{do not reflect the}} theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in <b>two</b> <b>samples</b> have bands in precisely the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones. Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.|$|E
25|$|In July 1976, Billy Arjan Singh {{acquired}} a hand-reared tigress named Tara from Twycross Zoo in the United Kingdom, and reintroduced {{her to the}} wild in Dudhwa National Park {{with the permission of}} India's then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the 1990s, some tigers from this area were observed to have the typical appearance of Siberian tigers, namely a large head, pale fur, white complexion, and wide stripes, and were suspected to be Siberian–Bengal tiger hybrids. Billy Arjan Singh sent hair samples of tigers from the national park to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad where the samples were analysed using mitochondrial sequence analysis. Results revealed that the tigers in question had an Indian tiger mitochondrial haplotype indicating that their mother was an Indian tiger. Skin, hair and blood samples from 71 tigers collected in various Indian zoos, in the National Museum in Kolkata and including <b>two</b> <b>samples</b> from Dudhwa National Park were prepared for microsatellite analysis that revealed that two tigers had alleles in two loci contributed by Bengal and Siberian tiger subspecies. However, samples of two hybrid specimens constituted a too small sample base to conclusively assume that Tara was the source of the Siberian tiger genes.|$|E
