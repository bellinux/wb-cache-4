40|$|Contemporary debates {{regarding}} the {{appropriate way to}} resolve custody and access disputes reflect deeply rooted conceptions of both <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> proper relationship between <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> state. The prevailing 2 ̆ 2 {{best interests of the}} child 2 ̆ 2 test and judicial presumptions favouring sole custody embody a traditional definition of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> a communitarian image of familial relationships. Conversely, current joint custody legislation adopts a liberal-contractual paradigm, in which <b>the</b> <b>family</b> is viewed as a joint partnership and children are conceived as assets to be equally divided upon termination ofthe spousal relationship.
