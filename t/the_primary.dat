40|$|I {{propose a}} new method to {{attenuate}} specularly-reflected multiples {{in the image}} space. The method {{is based on the}} difference in mapping between primaries and multiples in Subsurface Offset Domain Common Image Gathers (SODCIGs). I migrate the data with a velocity slower than that of <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> but faster than that of <b>the</b> multiples. <b>The</b> <b>primaries</b> are therefore undermigrated whereas the multiples are overmigrated. For positive data offsets, <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> are mapped to positive subsurface offsets and the multiples to negative subsurface offsets in SODCIGs. I then apply a tapered mute to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> and do adjoint migration on the multiples with the same velocity model to get an estimate of the multiples in data space. Similarly, a tapered mute is applied to eliminate the multiples and adjoint migration used to obtain an estimate of <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> in data space. The estimate of the multiples is adaptively matched to the data with the estimate of <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> used as a weight function to prevent matching <b>the</b> <b>primaries.</b> I illustrate <b>the</b> method with a 2 D synthetic dataset and show that <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> can be well recovered although some residual from the water bottom multiple remains...|$|R

5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto <b>the</b> <b>primary.</b> During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
