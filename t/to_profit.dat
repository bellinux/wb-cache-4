5|$|A 1905 {{review of}} the Falmouth defences {{concluded}} that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and the recently re-established battery at St Anthony's instead. Disarmed, St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War. In 1920 the castle {{was transferred to the}} control of the government's Office of Works, and was opened to visitors, being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway company who hoped <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> by increased numbers of visitors to Falmouth.|$|E

5|$|An upstart {{baseball}} league {{was created}} in 1884 by Henry Lucas called the Union Association(UA). Several member of the Blues' signed contracts with teams in the UA despite being subject to the reserve clause: including star players McCormick, Dunlap, and Jack Glasscock. These moves caused the Blues to become financially unstable. However, the franchise was able to secure {{a deal with the}} league for a better share of gate receipts. This deal was not enough for the franchise <b>to</b> <b>profit,</b> and Bulkeley sold the team to Lucas for $2,500 ($ current dollar adjustment) following the conclusion of the 1884season.|$|E
5|$|Despite Riley {{serving as}} the act's main draw, he was not {{permitted}} to become an equal partner in the venture. Nye and Pond both received {{a percentage of the}} net profit, while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance. In addition, because of Riley's past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, he was required to pay half of his fee to his agent Amos Walker. This caused the other men <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> more than Riley from his own work.|$|E

5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways <b>to</b> <b>profit.</b> American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E

50|$|Still, {{some issues}} have risen with this definition, {{specifically}} that dis-aggregate profit data are seldom obtainable. In turn, market shares {{and rates of}} company survival are typically used as alternative measures since both are commonly linked <b>to</b> <b>profits.</b> Still these links can be weak and lead to ambiguity. Early entrants always have a natural advantage in market share, which does not always translate <b>to</b> higher <b>profits.</b>|$|R
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of wanting to have the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{has been}} {{described}} as entertaining, controversial, and politically incorrect. He supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama's appeal to white voters. Ford later apologized for his comments, stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past. Ford's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green. In the beginning of his campaign, Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised, and although Ford's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity, because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home. Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin. Ford praised Obama's election in November 2008, but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn's family for allegedly attempting <b>to</b> <b>profit</b> off Obama's victory.|$|E
