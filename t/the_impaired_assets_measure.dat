40|$|The {{relative}} {{success of}} Australian and Canadian banks in weathering the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) {{has been noted}} {{by a number of}} commentators. Their earnings, capital levels and credit ratings have all been a source of envy for regulators of banks in Europe, America and the United Kingdom. The G- 20 and the European Union have tried to identify the features of the Canadian and Australian financial systems which have underpinned this success in order to use them in shaping a revised international regulatory framework. Despite this perceived success, <b>the</b> <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (also known as non-performing loans) of banks in both countries increased several fold over the GFC, and we investigate the determinants of this, using <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> as our <b>measure</b> of bank risk. Previous studies in other countries have tended to focus on the impact of bank specific factors, such as size and return on equity, in explaining bank risk. Our approach involves including those traditional variables, plus Distance to Default (DD), and a novel contagion variable, which is the effect of major global bank DD on Australian and Canadian banks. Using panel data regression over the period 1999 - 2008, we find that various balance sheet and income statement factors are not good explanatory variables for bank risk. In contrast, the contagion variable is significant in explaining Canadian and Australian bank risk, which suggests that prudential regulators should look to specifically allocate a portion of regulatory capital to deal with contagion effects.

The methodology adopted a survey research design with use of questionnaires and interviews with commercial banks head credit risk, head retail and head corporate banking division from 15 registered commercial banks in Zimbabwe. Research findings show that some banks were sitting on nonperforming loans due to poor credit analysis processes; wrong products offered to the clients; lending based on balance sheet strength instead of cash flow based lending; banks taking too much comfort in security; information asymmetry leading to moral hazard; economic environment and political influence. Key recommendations include an urgent setting up of the Credit Bureau; banks should not adjust clients request and the need for banks to consider the economic environment and adjust their credit culture.

40|$|Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No. 136, Impairment of Assets, {{was issued}} in 2005. The {{standard}} requires public listed companies {{to report their}} non-current assets at no more than their recoverable amount. When <b>the</b> value of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> is recovered, or partly recovered, FRS 136 requires the impairment charges to be reversed to its new recoverable amount. This study tests whether the reversal of impairment losses by Malaysian firms is more closely associated with economic reasons or reporting incentives. The sample of this study consists of 182 public companies listed on Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) that reported reversals of their impairment charges during the period 2006 - 2009. These firms are matched with firms which do not reverse impairment {{on the basis of}} industrial classification and size. In the year of reversal, this study finds that the reversal firms are more profitable (before reversals) than their matched firms. On average, the Malaysian stock market values the reversals of impairment losses positively. These results suggest that the reversals generally reflect increases in the value of <b>the</b> previously <b>impaired</b> <b>assets.</b> After partitioning firms that are likely to manage earnings and those that are not, this study finds that there are some Malaysian firms which reverse the impairment charges to manage earnings. Their reversals are not value-relevant, and are negatively associated with future firm performance. On the other hand, the reversals of firms which are deemed not to be earnings managers are positively associated with both future firm performance and current stock price performance, and this is the dominant motivation for the reversal of impairment charges in Malaysia. In further analysis, this study provides evidence that the opportunistic reversals are also associated with other earnings management manifestations, namely abnormal working capital accruals and the motivation to avoid earnings declines. In general, the findings suggest that the fair value measurement in impairment standard provides useful information to the users of financial statements...|$|R

40|$|The Asian Crisis has {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} strong domestic financial systems in overall economic development and stabilization. Less agreement is evident {{on the role of}} foreign banks in achieving this goal. We explore this issue by studying bank-specific data on lending by domestically- and foreign-owned banks in Argentina and Mexico. We find that foreign banks generally have had higher loan growth rates than their domesticallyowned counterparts, with lower proportionate volatility of lending, contributing to lower overall volatility of credit. Additionally, in both countries, foreign banks show notable credit growth during crisis periods. In Argentina, the loan portfolios of foreign and domestic privately-owned banks are similar, and lending rates analogously expand in response to aggregate demand fluctuations. In Mexico, foreign and domestic banks with lower levels of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> have similar loan responsiveness and portfolios. Stateowned banks (Argentina) and banks with high levels of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (Mexico) have more stagnant loan growth and weak responsiveness to market signals.

40|$|The paper {{explains}} the recent decline in bank asset quality using {{the notion of}} information reusability. Banks are viewed as information processors; they exist because of their advantage in extracting the surplus associated with the reusability of borrower-specific information. It is shown that a bank's incentive to screen loan applicants, and hence maintain {{the quality of its}} assets, depends on the surplus this screening can produce, which in turn depends on information reusability. Two recent changes in banks' operating environment are increased competition and greater temporal volatility in borrower credit risks. The former has directly reduced banks' informational surplus while <b>the</b> latter has <b>impaired</b> information reusability. Hence screening expenditures have been reduced and the diminution of screening has lowered the quality of bank assets. It is also shown that an increase in deposit insurance premia has an effect similar to that of narrowing interest spreads and therefore will result in reduced <b>asset</b> screening and <b>impaired</b> <b>asset</b> quality. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the recent Financial Crisis - after it had been widely accepted that “a serious disturbance in the economy of Member States” had occurred, and that several measures were required to remedy this disturbance, various Commission communications were adopted. The Communications include: The first Communication which (initially), {{was the only one}} that the Commission adopted intentionally: the Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions in the context of the current global financial crisis (hereinafter "the Banking Communication"). However, faced with the pressure to issue more guidelines (such pressure being exerted by Member States), the Commission adopted three further Communications: the Communication on the re capitalisation of financial institutions in the current financial crisis: limitation of aid to the minimum necessary and safeguards against undue distortions of competition (hereinafter "the Recapitalisation Communication"); the Communication “On <b>the</b> treatment of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> in <b>the</b> Community banking sector” (hereinafter, “the Toxic Assets Comunication”) and finally, the Communication on the return to viability and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Restructuring Communication"). ” Whilst the Banking and Re capitalisation Communications constituted the focus of study in Part I to this paper, this paper will focus on the impact of shadow banking and Basel III on regulatory arbitrage, the corresponding need for greater transparency and disclosure within financial markets – particularly within OTC markets, and impediments to the successful implementation of capital requirements which are aimed at fostering financial stability, coordination and harmonisation. Further, it will consider the extent to which regulators are prepared to deviate from regulations during the implementation of stress-testing and rescue programmes which are aimed at restoring stability to the financial system. The redefinition of quantitative and qualitative standards for capital, in implementing the Supervisory Capital Assessment Programme (SCAP), as illustrated in the paper, should demonstrate the extent to which regulators, independent of shadow banking practices, are prepared to deviate from capital regulations under adverse scenarios where certain regulations prove to be unduly stringen...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the accounting performance of the firms recognizing impairment losses and analyze the accounting behavior of those firms. We focus on two performance measures, i. e. sales margin and earnings to average total asset (ROA). Firms recognizing impairment losses experienced the decrease in ROA before. After the recognition of impairment losses, ROA was improved. That time-series movement is consistent with the conventional view. However, profit margin did not change in such a clear manner. Although, some firms with impairment losses smoothed earnings, we can find only weak evidence on earnings increasing management. On the other hand, we detect the strong evidence of "big bath" accounting. Our results imply the defects in accounting standards of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets,</b> which permits <b>the</b> large room of managerial discretion. ...|$|R

We adopt an income strategy approach in operationalising our magnitude of writedowns construct to consider the set of accounting policies and negative accruals potentially available to managers. Our focus is on the incentives for and constraints on management to make asset writedowns. We find that {{the magnitude of}} writedowns observed are associated with managers' incentives to writedown <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> that have declined in value, as well as the firm's capacity to absorb the financial statement effects of the writedown. The number of senior management changes found to be associated with greater writedowns in prior studies is also supported in this study when only writedowns taken to the income statement are considered. The quality of corporate governance mechanisms does not vary systematically with the magnitude of writedowns. ...|$|R
5000|$|A writedown is an {{accounting}} treatment that recognizes the reduced {{value of an}} <b>impaired</b> <b>asset.</b> <b>The</b> value of an asset may change due to fundamental changes in technology or markets. One example is when one company purchases another and pays more than the net fair value of its assets and liabilities. The excess purchase price is recorded on the buying company's accounts as goodwill. If it becomes apparent that the purchased asset {{no longer has the}} value recorded in the goodwill account (i.e., if the asset cannot be resold at the same price), the value in the goodwill asset account is [...] "written down". One example is when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones at a 60% premium in 2007, which News Corp. later had to write down by $2.8 billion because of declining advertising revenues.|$|R

Two alternative <b>measures</b> of <b>assets</b> are used: current assets {{and the value of}} assets brought to marriage. Results show that both assets at marriage and current assets are strongly determined by the human capital of husband and wife and the characteristics of their origin families. For both husband and wife, parents' landholdings are a consistent determinant of both assets at marriage and current assets. Contrary to the unitary model, husband's and wife's assets have different effects on the allocation of expenditures within the household. Wife's assets have a positive and significant effect on the share of expenditures on children's clothing and education. This result is robust to the choice of <b>asset</b> <b>measure</b> and estimation procedure. After endogeneity of assets is accounted for, husband's current assets have a positive and significant effect on the food expenditure share.

40|$|During the {{financial}} and sovereign crisis, governments protected {{the financial}} system from a collapse. <b>The</b> transfer of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> to a bad bank, or a guarantee on these assets, {{is one of the}} state aid measures applied by governments to preserve financial stability. The transfer price or guaranteed value is crucial in the assessment of state aid. The real challenge is thus to determine the state-aid-compatible value of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets,</b> which is called the Real Economic Value (REV). The REV of a portfolio of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> is based on a valuation methodology that was established by the European Commission. This methodology uses, inter alia, a suitable credit risk premia. It is therefore important to compare the risk premia actually applied in the REV method to the long-term average risk premia. For that reason, we examine the relative credit risk premium, also called coverage ratio, which is the ratio between the actual and risk-neutral default probability. The latter is the default probability derived from market quotes. The coverage ratio captures the magnitude of distress and perceived risk in credit markets. We consider coverage ratios for different time periods and quantify its long-term average value. Special attention is given to {{the financial and}} sovereign crisis and their impact on credit risk premia. We compute the actual default probabilities from yearly transition matrices, while the risk-neutral default probabilities are estimated from credit default swaps. We find that the long-term coverage ratios increased by 30 to 80 %. Our results show that coverage ratios have increased since 2008 and that its post-crisis levels (after 2012) are still higher compared to pre-crisis values. If one interprets this increase as a permanent shift in risk premia, it will impact corporates' funding costs. To study the differences between industries in terms of credit risk premia, we change the estimates for the actual default probability and use Moody's Expected Default Frequencies (EDF). For the banking sector, we observe an underestimation of the credit risk before the financial crisis and even after the sovereign crisis this underestimation persists, although to a lesser extent. This observation raises doubts about the applied recovery rate assumption of 40 % for senior debt. We examine therefore if the risk-neutral recovery rates for the banking sector are different from this standard value. To this end, we apply and extend the model of Schläfer and Uhrig-Homburg (2014). The model assumes absolute priority rule, which reinforces that senior creditors are paid back in full before the subordinated debt holders can recover their investment. Historical data shows that for the banking sector the absolute priority rule is not always respected and thus senior debt holders transfer a certain amount of the value, to which they are entitled, to the subordinated debt holders. We include absolute priority rule violation in the model and adjust it to the bank specific liability structure. We find empirical evidence that credit markets assume absolute priority rule violation and that the standard assumption of a risk-neutral recovery rate of 40 % is not valid for senior debt of European banks in the considered time period. Our estimates are higher than these standard assumptions. In the case of absolute priority rule violation, the average recovery rate implied by the market for senior and subordinated debt are respectively 82 % and 73 %. Comparing the average implied recovery rates with their historical counterparts indicates that the recovery risk premium is underestimated for senior debt and subordinated debt. The magnitude of the underestimation of the recovery risk premium on senior debt is smaller than the one on subordinated debt. In the last part of this dissertation, we study banks' coverage ratios by incorporating implied recovery rates in the calculations of credit risk premia. Before the financial crisis (2006 and 2007), we still observe that the credit risk of European banks was underestimated. The credit risk premia increased during the financial and sovereign crisis and reduced again {{in the last years of}} our observation period (2006 - 2014). From the start of the financial crisis, we do not find evidence for the underestimation of banks' credit risk premia, which indicates a permanent shift in banks' coverage ratios. This observation points to higher financing costs on banks' debt compared to pre-crisis levels. Our results imply that corporates will face, ceteris paribus, higher credit risk premia and thus higher financing costs on their debt. For banks, this finding is even more pronounced. With the new resolution regulation for banks, due to the enforcement of the strict application of the absolute priority rule, the implied recovery rates of subordinated debt will decrease. Given that the default probability stays the same, banks' subordinated debt will become more expensive. Our insights are valuable for state aid assessments, for pricing default-prone financial instruments and for risk management practices that estimate risk-neutral default and recovery rates. nrpages: 170 status: publishe...|$|R
