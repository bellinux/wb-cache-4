5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|This {{effectively}} left Pistrucci {{with little}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mint. He created several medallic works, for example a small memorial medal for the King's brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He {{was asked to}} design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George's death in 1830, but declined as {{he was asked to}} copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830–1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, and he may have concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.|$|E

She raised her eldest son on her own without ever being married, which was an unusual thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. In 1958 she wrote a semi-autobiographical book called Why Should I be Dismayed under the pseudonym of Ann Bruce, which describes her life from being in the A.T.S in occupied Germany to being a single parent and living in the conservative post second world war era.|$|E
25|$|The {{dialogue}} {{begins with}} an unnamed friend of Socrates asking him how his pursuit of the young Alcibiades, just now reputed to be growing his first beard, was proceeding. Socrates explains that while he has just been {{in the company of}} Alcibiades, his mind is now on more interesting matters. He says that Protagoras, the wisest man alive (309c–d), is in town. Socrates relates the story of how his young friend, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus, came knocking on his door before daybreak and roused him out of bed. Hippocrates was in a big hurry to be present when Protagoras held court, as he was expected <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> home of Callias.|$|E
25|$|Idle {{stated that}} the two things that made his life bearable were {{listening}} to Radio Luxembourg under the bedclothes and watching the local football team, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E

500|$|With {{little for}} an {{archaeology}} officer <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> OS in wartime, in mid-1941 Crawford was seconded to the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England [...] "for special duties during wartime". They assigned him {{to carry out}} a project of photographic documentation in Southampton for the National Buildings Record, producing images of many old buildings or architectural features that were threatened by the Luftwaffe's bombing campaign. He appreciated the value of this work, taking 5,000 photographs {{over the course of the}} war. In 1944, the Council for British Archaeology was founded, and while Crawford was invited to serve on its first council, he declined the offer, being lukewarm about the project.|$|E
500|$|Gjems-Onstad {{was active}} in the boy scouts before the invasion, and he was because of his {{experience}} there asked to instruct in map and compass for a volunteer military training program in late 1939. He thereafter became scout leader as the former leader went to fight in the Winter War. Due to the war in Europe, the scout exercises became increasingly serious, and the scout movement arguably had a big part in the early organisation of the Norwegian resistance. In the winter of 1939/40, Gjems-Onstad commenced training in orienteering and signaling during the night. The weekend before the invasion, he and a friend prepared [...] "for war" [...] by training and sleeping in a tent in the snow in the forest Vestmarka, which was seen as unusual <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
500|$|In {{his second}} year of college, Thompson {{embarked}} {{on a trip to}} San Juan, Puerto Rico as part of an exchange program. He spent six months in an apartment with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song [...] "Crackity Jones;" [...] many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view Halley's Comet (he later said it [...] "seemed like the cool romantic thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time"), or start a rock band. He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words [...] "we gotta do it, now is the time Joe," [...] to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.|$|E

500|$|Khrushchev was {{undecided}} what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> summit {{even as he}} boarded his flight to Paris. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers {{on the plane and}} Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise {{that there would be no}} further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace. Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. President offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit. Eisenhower accused Khrushchev [...] "of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested". Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. President could enjoy his favorite sport, was canceled by Khrushchev.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She {{may not be an}} actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

On-screen Carmel's {{marriage}} collapsed, and the following month her father died, so she left Walford to tend to her grieving mother. She last appeared in August 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Desmond Morton, one of Stanley's {{students}} at RMC in the 1950s {{and now a}} [...] Canadian military historian and author, and formerly the founding director of Montreal's McGill Institute for the Study of Canada observed: [...] "George's books and their non-conventional wisdom are a great contribution to this country.

Glasberg commented, [...] "Ziva and Ray are a little open-ended at the moment. There isn't any closure to it. We'll have to see where it leads, but I think he was pretty clear that he has a job <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment, and that's gonna be the primary focus for him."

Selena wanted to get married that day, but Chris argued it wasn't the right thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment.
