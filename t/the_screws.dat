5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only <b>the</b> <b>screws,</b> Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E

50|$|The threads on a {{right-handed}} screw are a right-handed helix.

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft.

The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{diagnostic}} method of screw behavior during extrusion has been designed, developed, {{and carried out}} on a 63. 5 -mm single screw extruder, equipped with either a basic conveying screw or a mixing screw.

5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>screw</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} of the simple {{machines}} to be invented. [...] <b>The</b> <b>screw</b> appeared in ancient Greece and Egypt, and by the first century BC was used in the form of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> press and <b>the</b> Archimedes' <b>screw,</b> but when it was invented is unknown. Greek philosopher Archytas of Tarrentum (428 - 347 BC) was said by the Greeks to have invented <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> Although <b>the</b> Greek philosopher Archimedes is credited by the Greeks with inventing <b>the</b> Archimedes <b>screw</b> water pump around 234 BC. records indicate it was first used in ancient Egypt. [...] Archimedes was first to study <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> as a machine, so he is sometimes considered the inventor of <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> Greek philosophers defined <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> as one of the simple machines and could calculate its (ideal) mechanical advantage. For example, Heron of Alexandria (52 AD) listed <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> as one of the five mechanisms that could [...] "set a load in motion", defined it as an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, and described its fabrication and uses,including describing a tap for cutting female screw threads.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{simulation of}} trabecular surface remodeling {{was performed to}} investigate the basic effects of a fixation <b>screw</b> on <b>the</b> trabecular structural changes in a vertebral body. Voxel-based finite elements were used to construct computational models of <b>the</b> bone and <b>screw</b> for an entire vertebral body with <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> and for <b>the</b> bone-screw interface. The remodeling simulation for the entire vertebral body showed that the implantation of <b>the</b> fixation <b>screw</b> caused changes in the mechanical environment in the cancellous bone, leading to trabecular structural changes at the cancellous level. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> on trabecular orientation was greater in the regions above and below <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> than on that in front of <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> In <b>the</b> case of the bone-screw interface, the trabecular structural changes depended on the load applied to <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> It was suggested that bone resorption predicted in the pull-out loading case would be a candidate cause of loosening of <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> <b>The</b> {{results indicate that the}} effects of <b>the</b> implanted <b>screw</b> on <b>the</b> trabecular structural changes would be more important for longer-term fixation. 1...|$|R
25|$|The screwed {{butt joint}} uses {{one or more}} screws {{inserted}} after the joint has been brought together. <b>The</b> <b>screws</b> are usually inserted into an edge on the long grain side of one member and extend through the joint into the end grain of the adjacent member. For this reason, long screws are required (usually 3 times {{the thickness of the}} member) to ensure good traction. These joints may also be glued although it is not necessary.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{application}} of case-hardening is on screws, particularly self-drilling screws. In order for <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> {{to be able}} to drill, cut and tap into other materials like steel, the drill point and the forming threads must be harder than the material(s) that it is drilling into. However, if the whole screw is uniformly hard, it will become very brittle and it will break easily. This is overcome by ensuring that only the case is hardened and the core remains relatively soft. For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, Plücker coordinates, {{introduced}} by Julius Plücker in the 19th century, {{are a way}} to assign six homogeneous coordinates to each line in projective 3-space, P3. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a one-to-one correspondence between the 4-dimensional space of lines in P3 and points on a quadric in P5 (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of Grassmann coordinates (which describe k-dimensional linear subspaces, or flats, in an n-dimensional Euclidean space), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in geometric algebra. They have proved useful for computer graphics, and also can be extended to coordinates for <b>the</b> <b>screws</b> and wrenches {{in the theory of}} kinematics used for robot control.|$|E
30|$|Many factors affect <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> preload, {{such as the}} {{coefficient}} of friction between the surface, the elastic modulus of <b>the</b> <b>screw,</b> <b>the</b> geometry of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> and of <b>the</b> connection, the fit of the components, insertion torque, the presence of lubricant, and occlusal overload [12]. <b>The</b> optimal <b>screw</b> preload should induce a stress in the joint of about 60 – 75 % of the yield strength of the material [20]. There are many methods to measure screw preload [21], removal torque measurement being the most common [22]. The removal torque is the rotational force used to loosen <b>the</b> <b>screw.</b> <b>The</b> greater the preload obtained, the higher is the removal torque value.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{majority}} of <b>screws</b> are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread; a common mnemonic device for remembering this {{when working with}} screws or bolts is [...] "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." [...] Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your right hand around <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> with your thumb pointing is the direction you want <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> to go. If <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> is right-handed (most screws are) and you turn <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> in <b>the</b> direction of your fingers <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> will move {{in the direction of}} your thumb. Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.|$|R
25|$|This {{is another}} old design making a {{comeback}} thanks to Lee Valley's Veritas Toolworks.

50|$|This lobular thread {{has other}} {{advantages}} too.

50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} without a pilot hole, or with too small a pilot hole, {{the core of}} <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> may bind and lead to <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> being broken. <b>The</b> {{appropriate}} pilot hole will prevent binding while providing sufficient friction to keep <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> from loosening.

30|$|The {{stability}} of the implant-abutment connection comes from both <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> function and <b>the</b> frictional resistance between the conical, contacting metallic surfaces of the connection [10]. An abutment screw provides stability via a clamping force [11, 12]. When rotational torque is applied to <b>the</b> <b>screw,</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> elongates and causes stress on the stem and threads. After that, elastic recovery of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> occurs, <b>the</b> stem and threads of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> are in tension and a clamping force is created, pulling the abutment and the implant together.
