25|$|It was {{traditionally}} thought (especially by the Aristotelians) {{that the}} air did not have lateral weight: that is, that the kilometers of air above the surface did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a simple truth. Torricelli questioned that assumption, and instead proposed that air had weight {{and that it was}} the latter (not the attracting force of the vacuum) which held (or rather, pushed) up the column of water. He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3m) was reflective of the force of the air's weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting how much water can fall from the tube into it). In other words, he viewed the barometer as a balance, an instrument for measurement (as opposed to merely being an instrument to create a vacuum), and because {{he was the first to}} view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer (in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> we now use the term).|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two papers that use off-training set (OTS) error to {{investigate}} the assumption -free relationship between learning algorithms.

In this first paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for any two algorithms A and B, there are "as many" targets (or priors over targets) for which A has lower expected OTS error than B as vice-versa, for loss functions like zero-one loss. In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is "anti-cross-validation" (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory.

25|$|Example 6. Periodic {{sequence}} with {{period a}} power of two. This is a proper subalgebra of Example 5 (a proper subalgebra equals the intersection of itself with its algebra). These {{can be understood as}} the finitary operations, with the first period of such a sequence giving the truth table of the operation it represents. For example, the truth table of x0 in the table of binary operations, namely 2f10, has period 2 (and so can be recognized as using only the first variable) even though 12 of the binary operations have period 4. When the period is 2n the operation only depends on the first n variables, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the operation is finitary. This example is also a countably infinite atomless Boolean algebra. Hence Example 5 is isomorphic to a proper subalgebra of itself!

500|$|Although {{the play}} and his {{newspaper}} work helped expose him to a wider audience, the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit. He made both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry, and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds whenever he performed. In an 1894 article, Hamlin Garland wrote that Riley's celebrity resulted from his reading talent, saying [...] "his vibrant individual voice, his flexible lips, his droll glance, united to make him at once poet and comedian—comedian in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> makes for tears {{as well as for}} laughter." [...] Although he was a good performer, his acts were not entirely original in style; he frequently copied practices developed by Samuel Clemens and Will Carleton. His tour in 1880 took him to every city in Indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures, including Maurice Thompson with whom he began to develop a close friendship.|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is no sense in which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with Roman Catholic theology, Aquinas argues that humans can neither wish nor do good without divine grace.
