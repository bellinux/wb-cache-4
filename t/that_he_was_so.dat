5|$|Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, {{who played}} Paul McCartney's fictional {{grandfather}} John McCartney, was already well-known to British audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> clean reflects {{a play on}} his sitcom role, where he was always {{referred to as a}} dirty old man. In other roles, Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin played the group's road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director. Brian Epstein, the group's real manager, had an uncredited bit part.|$|E
5|$|Bede was a Northumbrian, {{and this}} tinged {{his work with}} a local bias. The sources {{to which he had}} access gave him less {{information}} about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of Boniface, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for Aldhelm, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held imperium, or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, Ceawlin, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian Robin Fleming states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.|$|E

25|$|Since then, many {{elaborate}} and often conflicting {{stories have been}} told regarding Gómez's alleged exploits alongside Jose Gaspar, with some claiming that Gómez was the pirate's cabin boy, others stating {{that he was the}} Floriblancas first mate, and some claiming that he was Gaspar's brother-in-law. Some versions of the legend also claim that, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> poor that he petitioned the Lee County Commission for a $8 per month stipend, Gómez knew the whereabouts of Gaspar's vast treasure cache supposedly hidden in the Charlotte Harbor area.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year, Hurt won further acclaim for his bravura {{performance as}} the Roman emperor Caligula in the BBC drama serial, I, Claudius. In a much later documentary about the series, I Claudius: A Television Epic (2002), Hurt revealed that he had originally declined the role {{when it was first}} offered to him, but that series director Herbert Wise had invited him to a special pre-production party, hoping Hurt would change his mind, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressed by meeting the rest of the cast and crew that he reversed his decision and took the role.|$|E
25|$|Gürsel {{served in}} the Army for 45 years. During World War I, he participated in the Battle of Çanakkale in Dardanelles, Gallipoli as a {{lieutenant}} with the First Battery of the 12th Artillery Regiment in 1915 and received the War Medal. He later fought at the Palestine and Syria fronts in 1917 and became {{a prisoner of war}} by the British while suffering malaria during his command of the 5th Battery of the 41st Regiment on 19 September 1918. Gürsel was kept as a prisoner of war in Egypt until 6 October 1920. During his presidency much later, when interviewed by the foreign press as to why he had not learned English during his captivity, he somewhat regretfully recalled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> frustrated to be a captive, he protested and studied French in the British camp instead.|$|E
25|$|The Austrians lost six {{guns and}} 2,000 {{casualties}} including d'Aspré captured and Major Franz Muller of the Kaunitz Regiment killed. Their losses fell {{heavily on the}} Württemberg Regiment. The French suffered 700 casualties including Colonel Gérard Lacuée of the 59th killed. With crossings at Günzburg and Elchingen controlled by the French, Mack gave up his plan to cross at Günzburg and ordered the army to retreat to Ulm. Mack later excused his mistake in instructing Gyulai to rebuild the bridge. He claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> aborbed in writing orders on the 9th {{that he did not}} notice the cannon fire. Ney reported to Napoleon that both Mack and Ferdinand had been at Günzburg on the 9th and suggested that a strong enemy force lay at Ulm. However, after interviewing his prisoner d'Aspré, Ney concluded that the Austrians were retreating to Biberach. Napoleon then ordered Ney to attack Ulm, not understanding that he was sending a single corps against the entire Austrian army. The next action was the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the neutral}} Republic of Genoa {{had refused to}} loan the French money, the representative-on-mission Antoine Christophe Saliceti asked the French army {{commander}} Barthélemy Louis Joseph Scherer for 6,000 men to advance in order to intimidate the civic authorities. On 27 March, Pittoni reported to Beaulieu about the movement of these troops to Voltri. Bonaparte, who had just taken command, ordered the movement halted the next day. At first he wanted to withdraw the exposed unit, but later decided to hold the position at Voltri. To counter this threat, on 31 March, Beaulieu ordered Pittoni in invade the Republic of Genoa and cross the Bocchetta Pass. Pittoni occupied Novi Ligure with 2,800 men and started his men on the road up the pass. The Lattermann Regiment was left to guard Novi. Beaulieu apparently was on hand because {{he noted that the}} weather was uncomfortably cold and that Pittoni was not well, though he did his soldierly duty. The army commander sent one 12-pound cannon, one 6-pound cannon, and two 7-pound howitzers to join Pittoni's force. By 8 April, Pittoni was in position at the Bocchetta Pass but informed Beaulieu <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> isolated that it would take him six hours of marching over bad roads to link with Vukassovich near Masone.|$|E
500|$|Quentin Tarantino {{was quoted}} as saying about the film's box office results, [...] "It was disappointing, yeah. But the movie worked with the audience.

Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Before Mulan, American singer Donny Osmond had {{auditioned for}} the lead role of Hercules in Hercules, a role {{for which he was}} {{ultimately}} not cast because the directors felt that is voice sounded [...] "too old" [...] and [...] "too deep" [...] for the character. Osmond later revealed in an interview with People <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> embarrassed by his Hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely. A few months later, Disney contacted Osmond with interest in casting him as the singing voice of Shang after comparing his audition tapes to BD Wong and determining that both actors have [...] "very similar voices." [...] In one scene, Osmond's character, Shang, is hit in the stomach while singing [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You". In order to sound as realistic as possible, Osmond punched himself in the stomach several times while recording the song.|$|E
500|$|Rowe {{announced}} {{that she was pregnant}} with Jackson's second child in November 1997. The baby was to be a girl and named Paris, after the French city in which her parents said she was conceived. On April 3, 1998, blue-eyed Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born. Her middle names come from Michael and his mother, Katherine. Jackson later claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> anxious following the birth of his daughter, that he [...] "snatched" [...] her and ran straight home [...] "with all the placenta and everything all over her". Rowe later confirmed that Jackson had the placenta frozen. Following the birth, Jackson's associates contacted Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in Rome, {{in the hope that the}} Pontiff would personally baptize the pop star's daughter. An official for the Pope informed Jackson by letter that the leader of the Catholic Church would not participate in what may be perceived as a publicity stunt.|$|E
500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E

50|$|A subtext of Miss Sophia's Diary, left unspoken {{until late}} in the story, is that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the {{instinct}} to be attracted to someone like Ling Jishi and the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> irredeemably unenlightened.|$|R

500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> psychologically damaged. I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E
500|$|Panait Cerna's {{lifetime}} {{success and}} literary fame {{made him the}} target of adulation among his fellow traditionalists, a camp which united various Junimea affiliates and Sămănătorul contributors. According to Călinescu, this group saw him as Romania's answer to Schiller and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Junimea saw in him {{one of its most}} important members of the early 20th century, while several historians note <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> only because, at that stage, the literary society was declining. Mehedinţi's 1914 account of the Junimist promotion of the [...] "original manifestations of Romanian culture" [...] listed Cerna alongside Alexandru G. Florescu and other minor writers. Literary historian Z. Ornea argues that this evidenced not just a decline in standards, but also Mehedinţi's [...] "tastelessness". Also according to Ornea, the association with Dragomirescu was also characteristic for the Junimist twilight, given that this circle had failed to impose [...] "a new literary direction", and was tributary to the legacy of various traditionalist groups. At the same time, both Dragomirescu and his disciple Ion Trivale upheld him as a model to follow, equating him with the mid-19th century Classicist Grigore Alexandrescu. Zarifopol deplores Cerna's submission to traditionalist and Classicist goals, arguing that it eventually ruined Cerna as a poet and made him unhappy.|$|E
500|$|Dan J. Kroll of {{the website}} SoapCentral {{wrote that the}} process to find a {{replacement}} for Tom was an [...] "exhaustive search". Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the [...] "Top 5 Actresses" [...] poll of CBS Soaps In Depth for over eight consecutive weeks. [...] Her relationship with Billy has garnered a significant fan following, allowing them to lead CBS Soaps In Depths [...] "Top 10 Couples" [...] poll for over six consecutive weeks. Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and Billy, said she thought their [...] "retro wedding" [...] was [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "extremely well written and not overdone".

Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are [...] "so scrumptious together", and that [...] "it's so nice to have some reason to say something kind about The Young and the Restless for a change". Giddens {{also said that he}} [...] "adores this pairing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> prepared to hate". Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: [...] "Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from [...] "until death to us part," [...] to [...] "until one of us changes our mind." [...] However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.|$|E
