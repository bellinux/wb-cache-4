5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E

25|$|Predation by the {{non-native}} rosy glandina snail Euglandina rosea {{remains a}} serious threat to the survival of Newcomb's snail. This predatory snail, introduced into Hawai`i in 1955, has established populations throughout the main islands. <b>The</b> <b>rosy</b> glandina feeds on snails and slugs, and field studies document that it readily feeds on native snails found in Hawai`i. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> glandina snail exhibits remarkable hunting behaviors leading to capture and predation of submerged prey. Although terrestrial, <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> glandina will fully immerse itself in water to locate and feed on aquatic molluscs such as Newcomb's snail. <b>The</b> <b>rosy</b> glandina has been observed on the wet, algae-covered rocks of the Makaleha Stream in close proximity to individual Newcomb's snails, and is believed to prey on them. <b>The</b> <b>rosy</b> glandina snail is responsible for the extirpation of many populations and even the extinction of numerous species of native snails throughout the Pacific Islands, and represents a significant threat to the survival of Newcomb's snail.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rosy</b> {{periwinkle}} case {{dates from}} the 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>rosy</b> periwinkle, while native to Madagascar, had been widely introduced into other tropical {{countries around the world}} well before the discovery of vincristine. This meant that researchers could obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The use of the plant as a cure for diabetes was the original stimulus for research. Effectiveness in the treatment of both Hodgkin's Disease and leukemia were discovered instead. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant. The Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapeutic drug vinblastine is derivable from <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> periwinkle.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, {{while he}} was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time. They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924. In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to {{dedicate}} himself completely to writing. Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends, and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy <b>The</b> <b>Rosy</b> Crucifixion.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rosy</b> Wilde gallery was an artist-run project space, {{established}} in 2003 by British artist Stella Vine {{in a former}} butcher's shop below her house in east London, to showcase work by emerging artists. The gallery was not making money and Vine was expecting bailiffs, when one of her paintings of Diana, Princess of Wales, was bought by art collector Charles Saatchi to star in his New Blood show. This solved Vine's financial problems. The gallery was sold at auction in October 2004 and, in 2006, Vine opened a gallery {{of the same name}} in central London's Soho district.

25|$|In 1942, {{shortly before}} moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in <b>The</b> <b>Rosy</b> Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period {{of his life in}} Brooklyn falling in love with June and {{struggling}} to become a writer. Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan. In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in Big Sur.|$|E

25|$|His final {{departure}} from Rome {{was motivated by}} a solemn weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social position, and apparently the difficulties of meeting the ordinary expenses {{of living in the}} bustling metropolis (x. 96); and he looks smilingly ever forward to a return to <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> scenes familiar to his youth, apparently. The well-known epigram addressed to Juvenal (xii. I 8) shows that for a time his ideal was happily realized; but the more trustworthy evidence of the dry prose epistle prefixed to Book XII. proves and that he could not live happily away from the literary and social pleasures of Rome for long. The one consolation of his exile was a lady, Marcella, of whom he writes rather platonically as if she were his patronessand it {{seems to have been a}} necessity of his being to have always a patron or patronessthan his wife or mistress or harlot or muse or shrewish burden.|$|E
500|$|The type {{species of}} genus Rhodotus was {{originally}} described as Agaricus palmatus in 1785 by French botanist Jean Bulliard; mycologist Elias Magnus Fries later included {{it under the}} same name in his Systema Mycologicum. It {{was transferred to the}} then newly described genus Rhodotus in a 1926 publication by French mycologist René Maire. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin palmatus, meaning [...] "shaped like a hand"—possibly a reference to the resemblance of the cap surface to the lines in the palm of a hand. Common names for R.palmatus include the netted rhodotus, <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> veincap, and the wrinkled peach.|$|E

500|$|The red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) is a tropicbird, one {{of three}} closely related species of seabird of {{tropical}} oceans. Superficially resembling a tern in appearance, it has mostly white plumage with some black markings on the wings and back, a black mask and, as its common name suggests, a red bill. Most adults have [...] that are about two times their body length, with those in males being generally longer than those in females. The red-billed tropicbird itself has three subspecies recognized, including the nominate. The subspecies mesonauta is distinguished from the nominate by <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> tinge of its fresh plumage, and the subspecies indicus can be differentiated by its smaller size, more restricted mask, and more orange bill. This species ranges across the tropical Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The nominate {{is found in the}} southern Atlantic Ocean, the subspecies indicus in the waters off of the Middle East and in the Indian Ocean, and the subspecies mesonauta in the eastern portions of both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and in the Caribbean. It was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.|$|E
500|$|S.spraguei is {{a popular}} edible among novice {{mushroom}} hunters as it is readily identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with White Pine. Although this distinctiveness renders it unlikely {{to be confused with}} other species, it does share similar characteristics with several other Suillus species. S.spraguei bears some resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> larch bolete (S.ochraceoroseus), but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with larch. S.cavipes, another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk. S.lakei is less brightly colored than S.spraguei, has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with Douglas fir. S.decipiens has a less intensely red cap when young, but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble S.spraguei. S.decipiens generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from [...] in diameter, and stem that is typically [...] long by [...] thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5–1mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of hazel rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first named 1936 as Boletus felleus forma plumbeoviolaceus by American mycologist Walter H. Snell {{and one of}} his {{graduate}} students, Esther A. Dick, based on specimens found in the Black Rock Forest near Cornwall, New York. Regarding his decision to use the taxonomic rank forma, Snell wrote: [...] "The writer hesitates to multiply the number of forms (formae) and varieties with distinctive names, because of the ease with which one develops the habit of interpreting slight variations as definite taxonomic units... the word [...] "form" [...] is used instead of [...] "variety" [...] as making no commitment as to the actual status of the variable segregate under consideration, until further information is available." [...] The first collections made of the mushroom were of young, immature specimens, from which authors were unable to obtain spores for examination. It was not until a few years after that they found mature fruit bodies, which revealed that <b>the</b> <b>rosy</b> color of the pore surface took some time to develop. They concluded that this and other differences in physical characteristics, as well as differences in spore size, were enough to justify it being a species distinct from B.felleus, so in 1941 they raised the taxon to species status with the name Boletus plumbeoviolaceus. Noted Agaricales taxonomist Rolf Singer later transferred the taxon to Tylopilus in 1947, a genus characterized by a spore print that is pink, or wine red (vinaceous), rather than brown as in Boletus.|$|E
