Complex later named the song the fourth best song of 2012. Siân Rowe of NME compared the track to Prince’s [...] "Purple Rain" [...] {{and reported that}} the song [...] "is the kind of track you’ll lose hours and hours of your life <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> <b>week</b> alone, NME has spent at least two days having our minds freaked on by its space funk swirl." [...] Pitchforks Evan Minsker labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and wrote that [...] "the song's a 10-minute R event, traveling from club banger ancient Egypt ('send the cheetahs to the tomb') to the slow jam strip club('she's workin' at the Pyramid tonight'). It's a journey well-suited to Ocean's smooth croon." [...] The publication's Ryan Dombal commented, [...] "essentially reincarnates {{one of the most}} storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. However, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick stated that the track was the [...] "real miracle of the album", noting that while Ocean [...] "can embark on something as flamboyant as Pyramids - a 10-minute, tempo-shifting, minor-chord narrative of Egyptian queens and Las Vegas strippers, marrying Tangerine Dream sequencers and a jazzy John Mayer guitar solo to a rapturous slow jam – and make it all seem to make sense." ...|$|E
