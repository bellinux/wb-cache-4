5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas <b>to</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>that</b> point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts were made <b>to</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>that</b> the movement {{did not seek}} to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest with orders {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} congressional debate in which Rowan participated {{was over the}} {{election}} of William McCreery as representative from Baltimore, Maryland. Joshua Barney, McCreery's opponent in the election, claimed that McCreery did not meet a requirement in the Maryland Constitution that a representative live in the district from which he was elected for twelve {{months prior to the}} election. McCreery admitted that he had moved from Baltimore to the country prior to the election but claimed that he still owned his home in Baltimore and lived there during the winter months. A resolution was introduced to declare McCreery the duly elected representative from Baltimore, and an amendment was added <b>to</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>that</b> the grounds upon which the resolution was based were that McCreery had not abandoned his Baltimore home. Despite his support for states' rights, Rowan opposed the amendment because he felt that state sovereignty was only made possible by national sovereignty and that the national legislature had the right to declare a state law unconstitutional. By giving another reason for declaring McCreery duly elected, Rowan felt this issue would be obscured. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 92–8, and the resolution to declare McCreery duly elected passed 89–18.|$|E

25|$|A {{new trend}} in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers {{are not aware of}} the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the {{individual}} for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, <b>to</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>that</b> both are last names.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, the Japanese government's {{position}} is that the proper avenues for further claims are {{the governments of the}} respective claimants.

As a result, the British Government later paid additional compensation to all British POWs. There were complaints in Japan that the international media simply stated that the former POW was demanding compensation and failed <b>to</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>that</b> he was seeking further compensation, in addition to that paid previously by the Japanese government.|$|E

25|$|Local ambiguities persist {{only for}} {{a short amount of}} time as an {{utterance}} is heard or written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like The critic wrote the book was enlightening, which is ambiguous when The critic wrote the book has been encountered, but was enlightening remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or it could go on <b>to</b> <b>clarify</b> <b>that</b> the critic wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at was enlightening, which determines that the second alternative is correct.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the {{nickname}} Big Ben {{is the subject of}} some debate.

Now Big Ben is often used, by extension, to refer to the clock, the tower and the bell collectively, although the nickname is not universally accepted as referring to the clock and tower.
