Honeycomb in the [...] "supers" [...] that {{are not allowed to}} be used for brood (e.g. by the placement of a queen excluder) stays light-colored.|$|E
50|$|She {{studied at}} the School of Stained Glass at the Royal College of Art (1958-61). She had wanted to attend the School of Painting, but was dissuaded from {{applying}} as admission rates for women were much lower in that department. Despite the institutionalized sexism at her college, Boty {{was one of the}} stronger students in her class, and in 1960 one of her stained glass works was included in the <b>travelling</b> exhibition Modern <b>Stained</b> Glass organized by the Arts Council. Boty continued to paint on her own in her student flat in west London and in 1959 she had three more works selected for the Young Contemporaries exhibition. During this time she also became friends with other emerging Pop artists, such as David Hockney, Derek Boshier, Peter Phillips and Peter Blake.|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptations of}} tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) arising from growth in naphthalene-contaminated sand (0. 8 g kg− 1 sand dry weight (dw)) were {{investigated}} in the contexts of xenobiotic stress and water stress. The transfer of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) across the root endodermis was investigated using the hydrophobic Nile red stain as a PAH homologue. Nile red {{was applied to the}} epidermis of a living root to visualise uptake into the root through the transpiration stream, and the distance <b>travelled</b> by the <b>stain</b> into the root tissues was investigated using epi-fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 90 i). The results showed that the Nile red applied to the roots grown in naphthalene-contaminated sand was unable to penetrate the roots beyond the endodermis, whereas those grown in ‘clean’ sand showed evidence of uptake into the xylem vessels beyond the endodermis. Furthermore, partial collapse was observed in the cortex of naphthalene-treated roots, suggesting drought stress. Interestingly, the treated plants showed visual resilience to drought stress whilst the leaves of the control plants showed signs of wilting...|$|R
