5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} {{seats to}} hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election {{to hold a}} total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed in <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> of the second Fisher government exceeded even {{the output of the}} second Deakin government over a similar period.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> (1967–69) {{that this}} playoff {{structure}} was in effect, {{there was one}} use of the tie-breaker system. In 1967, the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts ended the season tied at 11–1–2 for {{the lead in the}} Coastal Division. The Colts came into the last game of the season undefeated, but were beaten by the Rams. Though the Colts shared the best win/loss record in the NFL that year, they failed to advance to the playoffs while three other teams with worse records won their divisions. This event figured into the decision in 1970 to include a wild-card team in the playoff tournament after the AFL–NFL merger.|$|E
