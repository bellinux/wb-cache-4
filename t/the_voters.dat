We {{present a}} voter verifiable Internet voting scheme which {{provides}} anonymity and eliminates {{the danger of}} vote selling even if the computer used by <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> cannot be fully trusted. The ballots cast remain anonymous- even the machine does not know the choice of <b>the</b> <b>voter.</b> It {{makes no sense to}} buy votes- <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> can cheat <b>the</b> buyer even if his machine cooperates with the buyer. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> can verity that his vote has been counted...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>voter's</b> ballot receipt {{does not}} {{indicate}} which candidate <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> cast their ballot for, and therefore it is not secret information. After an election, the election authority will post an image of each receipt online. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> can look up her ballot by typing in the serial number and she can check that information held by the election authority matches her ballot. This way, <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> can be confident that her ballot was cast as intended.|$|R
5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by <b>the</b> <b>voters,</b> but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|In December, 1995, the Nunavut capital {{plebiscite}} was held, and <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> in {{the future}} Nunavut territory chose Iqaluit as their capital city, defeating Rankin Inlet.

50|$|In GNU.FREE {{there are}} two servers, the electoral roll server (ERServer), and the {{regional}} server (RTServer). All communications are encrypted using Blowfish encryption with a key exchanged by RSA encryption. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> submits authentication information to the ERServer, who validates it. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> then fills out a ballot, and sends a key along with a timestamp to the RTServer. The RT-Server then stores this, and challenges <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> for <b>the</b> timestamp again. If <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> provides <b>the</b> valid timestamp, then the key is decrypted {{and sent to the}} ERServer. The ERServer records that <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> has submitted a key and cannot vote again. The RTServer then decrypts the vote, stores it, and deletes the key.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} that prevents the spread of elections {{with the possibility of}} remote voting over electronic networks, also called Internet Voting, is the use of unreliable client platforms, such as <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> computer and <b>the</b> Internet infrastructure connecting it to the election server. A computer connected to the Internet is exposed to viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, malware and other threats that can compromise the election’s integrity. For instance, it is possible to write a virus that changes <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> vote to a predetermined vote on election’s day. Another possible attack is the creation of a fake election web site where <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> uses a malicious vote program on the web site that manipulates <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> vote (phishing/pharming attack). Such attacks may not disturb the election protocol, therefore can remain undetected {{in the eyes of the}} election auditors. We propose the use of CodeVoting to overcome insecurity of the client platform. CodeVoting consists in creating a secure communication channel to communicate <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> vote between <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> and a trusted component attached to <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> computer. Consequently, no one controlling <b>the</b> <b>voter’s</b> computer can change the his/her’s vote. The trusted component can then process the vote according to a cryptographic voting protocol to enable cryptographic verification at the server’s side...|$|R

5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> who had cast their ballots for him, and should seek to win over <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, {{as the key to}} reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 3, 1953, {{was the second}} held under the city charter of 1951 and represented the first test of the Democratic city government of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. In the 1951 election, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> had elected a Democratic mayor {{for the first time}} in 67 years, breaking the Republican hold on political power in the city. They had also elected a majority-Democratic City Council along with Democrats for district attorney and other citywide offices (also called row offices). In 1953, <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> had the chance to continue the Democratic trend or to block it in the election for City Controller, Register of Wills, and various judges and magistrates. On election day, the Republican organization recovered from their 1951 losses, electing all their candidates citywide. Republicans celebrated the victory, but subsequent Democratic triumphs in the 1955 and 1959 elections made the 1953 result more of an aberration than a true comeback for the once-powerful Philadelphia Republican machine.|$|E
5|$|Several bestowals of {{the award}} have met with criticism. The posthumous award for M. G.

50|$|Another {{strategy}} is {{to vote for the}} top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes <b>the</b> <b>voter's</b> power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.|$|R

40|$|Brief Description: Hart InterCivic's eSlate is a {{multilingual}} voter-activated {{electronic voting}} system where <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> turns a Select Wheel and pushes a button to indicate his/her preference. The eSlate is connected via cable to the Judge's Booth Controller (JBC; image above) which provides vote activation and vote storage {{for up to}} twelve eSlates. A poll worker issues a four digit, randomly generated Access Code to <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> using <b>the</b> JBC. <b>The</b> <b>voter</b> enters <b>the</b> Access Code on the eSlate and votes using the select Wheel and Buttons. Once the ballot is cast, the votes are stored in redundant and physically separate areas of the eSlate System, including the eSlate, JBC and flash memory. The votes are transmitted via a cable to the JBC, and are stored on the JBC and on a flash memory card (Mobile Ballot Box or MBB) inside the JBC. Then the MBB is physically transported to election headquarters for tabulation. Detailed Voting Process: When <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> enters <b>the</b> precinct, poll workers first confirm that <b>the</b> <b>voter</b> is properly registered. Then, a poll worker using the Judge's Booth Controller (JBC) prints {{out a piece of}} paper with a four digit, randomly generated Access Code.
