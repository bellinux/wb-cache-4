He finds that [...] "the needlessly frustrating opening" [...] is to the games detriment because stat descriptions [...] "largely assumes you’re coming to the game from things like Dungeons and Dragons". He {{goes on to say}} that [...] "this game painfully, desperately needs a Getting Started <b>type</b> <b>guide.</b> There’s a manual, which is not optional, but even that is a weak introduction". [...] To the games credit, he {{goes on to say that}} [...] "the frustrating/good thing is that behind all of this waits a surprisingly good RPG. It’s bursting with carefully designed areas and clever ideas, as well some really fun gimmicks. You can start with just yourself, or use your god powers to create a few extra empty shells to back you up until you find suitable NPCs to fill slots. When they’re recruited, you can either take them warts and all or use your power to just straight up steal their souls, removing their tiresome free will". In conclusion, he finds that [...] "there’s a lot of really good stuff here, and the game is mostly excellent, but the path to actually getting into the damn thing is far more frustrating than it is rewarding. Once past it, the amount of freedom it offers in everything from character builds to your path around an open world designed to reward exploration is all great, and knowing the carrot is there does help. Even so, do be sure you have the dedication to keep chasing it while being brutally beaten with the stick".|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the efficacy and {{the feasibility of}} application of percutaneous lysis of epidural adhesions in failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) using a stiff <b>type</b> <b>guide</b> wire and 4 F vascular catheter. METHODS: Ninety two patients with FBSS were randomly divided into two groups, the control group (treated by injection dexamethasone only) and percutaneous lysis of epidural adhesions group. Visual analog scale scores (VAS) and therapeutic evaluation were observed in the preoperative, seven days postoperative, one month and six months postoperative. RESULTS: VAS scores for pain were significantly reduced in both groups at seven days. The VAS scores were in controlled group at one month, six months {{was significantly higher than}} that in epidural lysis group. However, there was no statistical difference in VAS scores of one month and six months when respectively compared to that of before operation in controlled group. Patients on epidural lysis reported clinical effectiveness rate was 50 %. Patients on control was 5. 26 %, there was a statistical difference between two groups. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous lysis of epidural adhesions by using a stiff <b>type</b> <b>guide</b> wire and 4 F vascular catheter is an effective method in the treatment of FBSS and it has a value in clinical application...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for representing an object by its constituent parts and their spatial connections. The approach {{is based on}} a set of primitive volumes called geons. We utilize the edge-junction graph of an object range image as input. This is a graph whose nodes are the junctions and whose arcs are the edges detected from the range image. The three-dimensional geometrical information at T junctions allows us to group pairs of corresponding T junctions. By following occluding, limb, concave edges and linking pairs of corresponding T junctions, we decompose the edge-junction graph into different subgraphs. Each of these subgraphs then corresponds to a constituent part of the object. For each part, edge curvature and <b>type</b> <b>guide</b> us to an inference regarding the corresponding geon shape. Also, the spatial connections among these parts can be deduced from concave edges and pairs of corresponding T junctions. Finally, the object is described by a directed graph whose nodes represent the part shapes and whose directed arcs represent the spatial connections...|$|E

40|$|Adjectives often {{associate}} with multiple dimensions (for example, healthy and sick may be ordered by blood pressure, pulse, sugar, cancer, etc.) So are nouns (for example, birds are characterized as small, feathered, flying, etc.) This paper presents empirical support to a typology of multidimensional predicates based on {{differences in the}} role of the dimensions in determining entities ‟ status in the predicates (Sassoon 2007, Chap. 7). Extensively supported cognitive concept-theories (for a review see Murphy 2002) analyze nouns as mean-based (an entity is classified under them iff, roughly, its mean degree in the dimensions reaches a standard.) While this analysis has already been applied to the semantics of predicates in general (Lakoff 1987), this paper provides corpus-based evidence to the effect that in adjectives, unlike nouns, the dimensions are not typically combined via averaging (mean operations). Rather, they combine through Boolean operations. The default interpretation of conjunctive adjectives like healthy involves implicit universal quantification over dimensions (dimension conjunction), while that of disjunctive adjectives like sick involves existential quantification (dimension disjunction). In mixed adjectives like intelligent, the force of quantification over dimensions is context relative (it is not determined semantically). Last but not least, the paper presents preliminary support to the hypotheses that antonym polarity and standard <b>type</b> <b>guide</b> our choice of quantifiers over dimensions in different adjectives. Thus, this research sheds new light on the nature of negative antonymy in multidimensional adjectives, as well as on the distribution of degree modifiers and exception phrases among multidimensional antonyms. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present <b>guided</b> <b>type</b> {{debugging}} as a {{new approach}} to quickly and reliably remove type errors from functional programs. The method works by gen-erating type-change suggestions that satisfy type specifications that are elicited from programmers during the debugging process. A key innovation is the incor-poration of target types into the type error debugging process. Whereas previous approaches have aimed exclusively at the removal of type errors and disregarded the resulting <b>types,</b> <b>guided</b> <b>type</b> debugging exploits user feedback about result types to achieve better type-change suggestions. Our method can also identify and remove errors in type annotations, which has been a problem for previous approaches. To efficiently implement our approach, we systematically generate all potential type changes and arrange them in a lattice structure that can be effi-ciently traversed when <b>guided</b> by target <b>types</b> that are provided by programmers...|$|R

An experimental study supported by theoretical evaluation of the guided wave characteristics is presented here that shows the applicability of Lamb wave <b>type</b> <b>guided</b> ultrasonic wave for detection of damage in foam core sandwich structures. Sandwich beam specimens were fabricated with 10 mm thick foam core and 0. 3 mm thick aluminum face sheets. Thin piezoelectric patch actuators and sensors are used to excite and sense guided wave. Group velocity dispersion curves and frequency response of sensed signal are obtained experimentally. The nature of damping present in the sandwich panel is monitored by measuring the sensor signal amplitude at various different distances measured {{from the center of}} the linear phased array. Delaminations of increasing width are created and detected experimentally by pitch-catch interrogation with guided waves and wavelet transform of the sensed signal. Signal amplitudes are analyzed for various different sizes of damages to differentiate the damage size/severity. A sandwich panel is also fabricated with a planer dimension of 600 mm x 400 mm. Release film delamination is introduced during fabrication. Non-contact Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is used to scan the panel while exciting with a surface bonded piezoelectric actuator. Presence of damage is confirmed by the reflected wave fringe pattern obtained from the LDV scan. With this approach it is possible to locate and monitor the damages by tracking the wave packets scattered from the damages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in multi-party session types (MPSTs) as a means of rigorously specifying protocols for interaction among multiple distributed participants.

We observe that explicit control flow information manifested by MPST opens intriguing avenues for performance improvements. In this paper, we present a session <b>type</b> <b>guided</b> performance enhancement framework for distributed object interaction in Java. Our framework combines control flow information from MPSTs with data flow information obtained from corresponding programs.

40|$|We {{report on}} the Lamb wave <b>type</b> <b>guided</b> wave {{propagation}} in honeycomb core sandwich structures. An experimental study supported by theoretical evaluation of the guided wave characteristics is presented that proves the potential of Lamb wave <b>type</b> <b>guided</b> wave for detection of damage in sandwich structures. A sandwich panel is fabricated with planar dimension of 600 mm x 600 mm, having a core thickness of 7 mm, cell size of 5 mm and 0. 1 mm thick aluminum face sheets. Thin piezoelectric patch actuators and sensors are used to excite and sense a frequency band limited guided wave with a central frequency. A linear phased array of piezoelectric patch actuators is used to achieve higher signal strength and directivity. Group velocity dispersion curves and corresponding frequency response of sensed signal are obtained experimentally. Linearity between the excitation signal amplitude and the corresponding sensed signal amplitude is found for certain range of parameters. The nature of damping present in the sandwich panel is monitored by measuring the sensor signal amplitude at various different distances measured {{from the center of}} the linear phased array. Indentation and low velocity impact induced damages of increasing diameter covering several honeycomb cells are created. Crushing of honeycomb core with rupture of face sheet is observed while introducing the damage. The damages are then detected experimentally by pitch-catch interrogation with guided waves and wavelet transform of the sensed signal. Signal amplitudes are analyzed for various different sizes of damages to differentiate the damage size/severity. Monotonic changes in the sensor signal amplitude due to increase in the damage size has been established successfully. With this approach it is possible to locate and monitor the damages with the help of phased array and by tracking the wave packets scattered from the damages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Emerging {{applications}} {{have increasingly}} specialized scheduling requirements. Changing the scheduling policy {{of an existing}} OS is, however, often difficult because scheduling code is typically deeply intertwined {{with the rest of}} the kernel. We have recently introduced the Bossa framework to facilitate the implementation and integration of new scheduling policies. While the use of Bossa simplifes the problem of implementing a new scheduler, knowledge of the control and data flow through the scheduling actions of the kernel is still needed to ensure that the behavior of the provided scheduling policy matches kernel expectations. In this paper, we propose a modular type system that provides a high-level characterization of the aspects of kernel behavior that affect the correctness of a scheduling policy.
