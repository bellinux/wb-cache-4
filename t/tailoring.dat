5|$|Cad and the Dandy is an {{independent}} <b>tailoring</b> company based in London, England with premises on Savile Row and in the City. It sells bespoke suits, manufactured from English and Italian fabrics, and using traditional <b>tailoring</b> methods, {{at a lower price}} than the traditional Savile Row houses.|$|E
5|$|Cad & the Dandy {{launched}} a new flagship store at 13 Savile Row in June 2013. The store is the first on the iconic <b>tailoring</b> street to hand-weave a cloth before making it up into a fully finished suit. Believing that Britain’s bespoke <b>tailoring</b> industry was facing a shortage of master tailors, the company established an apprenticeship programme in London, with young would-be tailors joining Cad & the Dandy’s 22 staff members at its three London locations, Savile Row, Birchin Lane and Canary Wharf.|$|E
5|$|Tailors {{started to}} take {{premises}} around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's <b>tailoring</b> premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As <b>tailoring</b> moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' working area {{with the addition of}} glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original external features.|$|E

40|$|Aims Chronic {{benzodiazepine}} use {{is highly}} prevalent and {{is associated with}} a variety of negative health consequences. The present study examined the long-term effectiveness of a <b>tailored</b> patient education intervention on benzodiazepine use. Participants A randomized controlled trial was conducted comprising three arms, comparing (i) a single <b>tailored</b> intervention; (ii) a multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention and (iii) a general practitioner letter. The post-test took place after 12 months. Participants Five hundred and eight patients using benzodiazepines were recruited by their general practitioners and assigned randomly to one of the three groups. Intervention Two <b>tailored</b> interventions, the single <b>tailored</b> intervention (patients received one <b>tailored</b> letter) and the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention (patients received three sequential <b>tailored</b> letters at intervals of 1 month), were compared to a short general practitioner letter that modelled usual care. The <b>tailored</b> interventions not only provided different and more information than the general practitioner letter; they were also personalized and adapted to individual baseline characteristics. The information in both <b>tailored</b> interventions was the same, but in the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention the information was provided to the participants spread over three occasions. In the multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention, the second and the third <b>tailored</b> letters were based on short and standardized telephone interviews. Measurements Benzodiazepine cessation at post-test was the outcome measure. Findings The results showed that participants receiving the <b>tailored</b> interventions were twice as likely to have quit benzodiazepine use compared to the general practitioner letter. Particularly among participants with the intention to discontinue usage at baseline, both <b>tailored</b> interventions led to high percentages of those who actually discontinued usage (single <b>tailored</b> intervention 51. 7 %; multiple <b>tailored</b> intervention 35. 6 %; general practitioner letter 14. 5 %). Conclusions It was concluded that <b>tailored</b> patient education can be an effective tool for reducing benzodiazepine use, and can be implemented easily...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the working {{mechanisms}} of a computer <b>tailored</b> physical activity intervention for older adults with environmental information compared to a basic <b>tailored</b> intervention without environmental information. Method A clustered randomized controlled trial with two computer <b>tailored</b> interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted among 1971 adults aged ≥ 50. The two <b>tailored</b> interventions were developed using Intervention Mapping and consisted of three <b>tailored</b> letters delivered over a four-month period. The basic <b>tailored</b> intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing <b>tailored</b> environmental information. Study outcomes were collected with questionnaires at baseline, three and six months and comprised total physical activity (days/week), walking (min/week), cycling (min/week), sports (min/week), environmental perceptions and use and appreciation of the interventions. Results Mediation analyses showed that changes in cycling, sports and total physical activity behaviour induced by the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention were mediated by changes in environmental perceptions. Changes in environmental perceptions did not mediate the effect of the basic <b>tailored</b> intervention on behaviour. Compared with the basic <b>tailored</b> intervention, the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention significantly improved cycling behaviour (τ = 30. 2). Additionally, the <b>tailored</b> letters of the environmentally <b>tailored</b> intervention were better appreciated and used, although these differences did not mediate the intervention effect. Discussion This study gave some first indications of the relevance of environmental perceptions as a determinant of changing physical activity behaviours and the potential effectiveness of providing environmental information as an intervention strategy aimed at enhancing physical activity behaviour among older adults. </p...|$|R
50|$|Duly impressed, {{the king}} relents, marries the <b>tailor</b> to the princess, {{and makes the}} <b>tailor</b> the ruler of half the {{original}} kingdom. The <b>tailor's</b> new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a <b>tailor</b> and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the <b>tailor,</b> who pretends to be asleep, and then calls out {{that he has done}} all these deeds and is not afraid of the men behind the door.

The <b>tailor</b> meets a giant who assumes that [...] "Seven at One Blow" [...] refers to seven [...] The giant challenges the <b>tailor.</b> When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the <b>tailor</b> squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The <b>tailor</b> counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a [...] "rock" [...] which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the <b>tailor</b> to help him carry a tree. The <b>tailor</b> directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the <b>tailor</b> will carry the branches. Instead, the <b>tailor</b> climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the <b>tailor</b> is supporting the branches.|$|R

5|$|Though the {{reputation}} of <b>tailoring</b> on Savile Row is for made-to-measure suits, ready-to-wear clothes were introduced by Gieves & Hawkes, a company formed in 1974 by the merger of two separate businesses who both date from the late 19th century: Gieves, a Royal Navy tailor founded in Portsmouth; and Hawkes, a London-based cap-maker and tailor to the British Army. Hardy Amies Ltd further broadened the scope and appeal of <b>tailoring</b> in Savile Row: in 1961, he staged the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Ritz Hotel in London, he designed costumes for the 1966 England World Cup team, and for the 1968 film , and dressed the Queen, designing the gown used for the Silver Jubilee portrait in 1977. Hardy Amies founded the company in 1946, converting the bombed out shell of No.14.

5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a <b>tailoring</b> {{workshop}} in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Johnson was {{selected}} as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren was defeated by former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column. He {{was elected to the}} Tennessee Senate in 1841, where he served a two-year term. He had achieved financial success in his <b>tailoring</b> business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.|$|E

5|$|Levski {{began his}} {{education}} {{at a school}} in Karlovo, studying homespun <b>tailoring</b> as a local craftsman's apprentice. In 1855, Levski's uncle Basil—archimandrite and envoy of the Hilandar monastery—took him to Stara Zagora, where he attended school and worked as Basil's servant. Afterward, Levski joined a clerical training course. On 7 December 1858, he became an Orthodox monk in the Sopot monastery under the religious name Ignatius (Игнатий, Ignatiy) and was promoted in 1859 to hierodeacon, which later inspired one of Levski's informal nicknames, The Deacon (Дякона, Dyakona).|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} cast {{was listed}} in {{the first edition of}} The Country Wife, as was standard practice, and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley's intentions. Wycherley wrote with the original actors in mind, <b>tailoring</b> the roles to their strengths.

5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the <b>tailoring</b> of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E

5|$|Bursać {{was born}} on 2August 1920 {{in the village of}} Kamenica, near Drvar in the region of Bosanska Krajina, the {{north-western}} sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina (then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929). The Drvar area was inhabited primarily by ethnic Serbs, with Bosnian Muslims and Croats forming less than four percent of the population. Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife, Joka, who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm. Like other village girls, Bursać did not go to school—only the boys attended elementary school in Drvar.

5|$|Everest {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of the bespoke casual movement which, as the name suggests, provides individually tailored casual clothing of Savile Row quality, including: casual shirts; smart-casual jackets; T-shirts; and jeans. In collaboration with Levi's in 2004, he designed a tailored-denim suit, sold in Japanese retailer Oki-Ni's stores. Expanding the bespoke casual concept, he offered a bespoke denim <b>tailoring</b> service dressing celebrities from sports, Hollywood and rock music, such as David Beckham, Kevin Bacon and Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs. Everest designed a suit collection in 2004/05 in collaboration with Rocawear, the fashion clothing company founded by American hip hop artists Damon Dash and Jay-Z. The advertising campaign was fronted by Dash's friends Kevin Bacon and Naomi Campbell. He teamed up with British casual and sportswear designer Kim Jones during 2005 and 2006. The collaboration produced <b>tailoring</b> collections for four seasons that were shown on the catwalk at Paris fashion week. For his next collaboration, in 2006 Everest showed a limited collection of menswear with New York hair salon Bumble and bumble, including a fully bespoke denim line, which retailed at around US$1,000. Marketed as a 'destination location', the retail space on the store's 8th floor, in the fashionable Meatpacking District of Manhattan, also featured a barbershop, a café and a teahouse. In autumn 2007, the Timothy Everest ready-to-wear collection was available in shops for the first time, including Flannels, Liberty and John Lewis. The range included suits, shirts and trousers. He was costume designer for the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, dressing its stars, including Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth. He opened a West End store in 2008, at Bruton Street, Mayfair, off Bond Street; less than five minutes walk from Savile Row.

In 1827, at the age of 18, he married 16-year-old Eliza McCardle, the daughter of a local shoemaker. The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln, first cousin of Thomas Lincoln, whose son would become president. The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852). Though she suffered from Tuberculosis, Eliza supported her husband's endeavors. She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing.
