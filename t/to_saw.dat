5|$|An eighth {{installment}} was planned, but {{the decrease}} in the box office performance for Saw VI compared to previous installments led <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> 3D being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for Saw VIII being incorporated into Saw 3D. Saw V director David Hackl was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming Lionsgate announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. Principal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor prepares {{some food}} and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man to {{a part of}} the {{hospital}} where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to {{the front door of the}} hospital, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off.|$|E

50|$|The 1880 season {{also saw}} {{the first year of}} 11 players to a team. From 1869 <b>to</b> 1873, one <b>saw</b> 25 players <b>to</b> a side. From 1873 <b>to</b> 1875, one <b>saw</b> 20 players per side. 1876 <b>to</b> 1879 <b>saw</b> 15 players per side.|$|R

5|$|Unlike Pi Vell, Pi Jove {{had escaped}} the attentions of vandals until more recently, {{due to its}} lower {{political}} profile and greater distance (200 m) from the road. In 2010, it was discovered with a circumferential cut through the bark, in addition to apparent shotgun damage. Vandals attacked it in June 2015, attempting <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> through one of its trunks, {{though it was not}} thought that the damage was serious enough to kill the affected trunk. As a precaution, in December 2015 arborists installed a frame to hold the three trunks together and ensure their stability. In January 2016, deeper chainsaw cuts were discovered on the already-damaged trunk which are believed harsh enough to kill the trunk altogether; these vandals also attacked Pi Vell.|$|E
25|$|Trapping in a pit depends {{largely on}} the terrain and {{availability}} of grass to cover it; pits are dug out {{in such a way}} that a fallen animal has little room to manoeuvre with its head slightly above the pit, so that it is easy <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> off the horn.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
50|$|Benching {{involves}} the simultaneous solution of multiple deformations introduced <b>to</b> the <b>saw</b> <b>to</b> counteract the predicted stresses of the saw in operation. Benchman can easily recognize variations in steel batches.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{video game}} company Konami {{currently}} owns the rights <b>to</b> the <b>Saw</b> interactive video game property. Konami stated in mid-2009 {{that they wanted}} <b>to</b> make <b>Saw</b> a series of video games to supplement the films. They also wish <b>to</b> make <b>Saw</b> their next big survival horror franchise next to their other property, Silent Hill. They stated that because Saw focuses on visual intensity and Silent Hill focuses on psychological terror, both could exist in the video game industry without directly competing against each other.|$|R
50|$|In 275, {{the senior}} minister, He Shao (賀邵), {{suffered}} a stroke and was paralysed. Sun Hao suspected that he was pretending and had him arrested and tortured by whipping and by subjecting him <b>to</b> <b>saws</b> and fires. He died under torture and his clan was exiled.|$|R
25|$|After Arakan, Minkhaung {{was riding}} high. He was greatly {{impressed}} by his son's performance, and wanted to make him his heir apparent. With the advice of Min Yaza, he sent away Tarabya's eldest son and potential rival to the throne Min Nyo to Kalay, a frontier state by the Manipuri border, as governor. He tried to appease his brother Theiddat, governor of Sagaing, by giving him command of the Northern Cavalry. The king then appointed Minye Kyawswa his heir apparent, and married him <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> Min Hla, a cousin of the groom.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1887, Bogan {{was convicted}} of murder, and sentenced to death. However, Bogan still had several friends in cowboy circles, namely Tom Hall, whom famed Old West detective Charlie Siringo would later {{identify}} as having actually been Tom Nicholls, a murderer from the Texas Panhandle. Hall paid professional safecracker James Jones to commit a minor crime in Cheyenne, and to allow himself to be captured, thus being placed in jail with Bogan. Concealed in his shoes Jones had saw blades, which he and Bogan used <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> through the bars and make an escape on October 4, 1887. Joined by fellow prisoners Charles H. LeRoy and Bill Steary, both horse thieves, they made their escape through a ventilator and onto the roof. Within hours a posse was organised {{in one of the}} largest manhunts in Wyoming history.|$|E
25|$|The northernmost mile (1.6km) of NY100B was {{originally}} part of Route2, an unsigned legislative route {{assigned by the}} New York State Legislature in 1908. The route began at the New York City line in Yonkers and went north through the eastern Hudson Valley to Valatie, where it ended at Route1. Route2 continued south from Dobbs Ferry Road on modern NY100A and north on what is now NY119. The Dobbs Ferry Road section of Route2 was improved to state highway standards {{as part of a}} contract awarded by the state of New York on June26, 1912, and added to the state highway system six months later on December27. Although the portion of Dobbs Ferry Road east of NY100A was state-maintained, it did not receive a posted route number until the late 1930s when it was designated as part of NY100B, a new route continuing west of NY100A to connect <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> Mill River Road (NY9A). The alignment of the route has not been changed since that time.|$|E
30|$|Both methods {{managed to}} {{increase}} {{the value of the}} <b>sawn</b> timber compared <b>to</b> <b>sawing</b> logs horns down and centered. The latter method is not always used in sawmills; however, it works as a good reference point, since it is rather independent of prices, qualities, and other factors affecting optimization.|$|R
50|$|Engineered lumber is cut to {{length and}} {{installed}} similar <b>to</b> <b>sawn</b> lumber; the flitch requires shop fabrication and/or field bolting. This coupled with a much increased self weight of the beam (11.4 lb for engineered wood vs. 25.2 lb for a flitch beam) decreases {{the viability of the}} system.|$|R

500|$|A Russian clergyman visiting ravaged Christian {{villages in}} northwestern Persia claimed {{to find the}} remains of several impaled people. He wrote: [...] "The bodies were so firmly fixed, in some instances, that the stakes could not be withdrawn; it was {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> them off and bury the victims as they were." ...|$|E
500|$|Saw II was {{immediately}} green-lit after Saws successful opening weekend a year earlier. Producers needed a script for a sequel [...] but James Wan and Leigh Whannell, director and writer of Saw, {{were working on}} Universal Pictures's Dead Silence. Music video director Darren Lynn Bousman had just completed a script for his first film The Desperate, {{and was trying to}} sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar <b>to</b> <b>Saw.</b> A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $1 million. Just as {{they were looking for a}} cinematographer, the American cinematographer David A. Armstrong, who had worked on Saw, arrived on the scene and suggested showing the script <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> producer Gregg Hoffman. [...] Hoffman read the script and called Bousman wanting to produce The Desperate. After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules, the two decided that The Desperate was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later, Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> was mixed. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film}} has a rating of 48%, based on 181 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's consensus reads, [...] "Saw is more than nasty enough for genre junkies, but far too twisted, gory, and shallow for more discerning horror fans." [...] Metacritic gave the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews".|$|E
30|$|The robust {{position}} {{performed better}} than the naive position for all error levels, increasing the potential value gain by 1.6 – 2.4  % points, compared <b>to</b> <b>sawing</b> logs horns down and centered. The pure rotation error has a more severe effect on value than a pure offset error, for the error size used.|$|R

50|$|The mill cannot catch enough wind in its {{sheltered}} location <b>to</b> enable wind-powered <b>sawing.</b> <b>To</b> {{demonstrate the}} <b>sawing</b> process <b>to</b> the public, the crankshaft {{is powered by}} an electric motor. The cogs of the brake wheel have been removed so the sails can be turned by the wind independently of the electric-powered saws.|$|R
500|$|With {{a budget}} of $11 million, Saw VI began {{principal}} photography on March 30, 2009 and wrapped on May 13, 2009. The film was shot at Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios. [...] Greutert said that the victims in traps would be more one-on-one with the trap and would be more personal to them. This was compared <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> IV and Saw V, {{which most of the}} traps were set in big rooms and involved several people at one time.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} by the Iranian director Tony Petrossian {{was recorded in}} the Los Angeles area in August 2006. The film {{is presented as a}} close-up of the soldier's pupil and iris, which reflect disconcerting images of war-themed horrors, flashbacks of his home, wife and children, and ultimately images of his death. [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] was used on the soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> III, and won an award for the Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Science and art were intermingled in {{the early}} Renaissance, with polymath artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making {{observational}} drawings of anatomy and nature. Da Vinci set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the [...] "father of modern science". Other examples of Da Vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> marbles and lift monoliths and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy and mechanics.|$|E
5000|$|White-Jacket was {{published}} in London by Richard Bentley on February 1, 1850, and in New York by Harper & Brothers on March 21, 1850.

500|$|By late 1617, Anne's {{bouts of}} illness had become debilitating; the letter writer John Chamberlain recorded: [...] "The Queen {{continues}} still ill disposed {{and though she}} would fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body." [...] In January 1619, royal physician Sir Theodore de Mayerne instructed Anne <b>to</b> <b>saw</b> wood to improve her blood flow, but the exertion served to make her worse. James visited Anne only three times during her last illness, though Prince Charles often slept in the adjoining bedroom at Hampton Court Palace and was at her bedside during her last hours, when {{she had lost her}} sight. With her until the end was her personal maid, Anna Roos, who had arrived with her from Denmark in 1590. Queen Anne died aged 44 on 2 March 1619, of a dangerous form of dropsy.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2012, the 15-month {{phase of}} {{planning}} and construction of Abyss began. In April 2013, Adventure World announced on their Facebook page {{that they would be}} adding a $12 million, world-class attraction in 2013. By May 2013 construction had begun. In June 2013, a concrete slab was poured prior to the construction of a show building. Shortly after track arrived in July 2013, Adventure World officially announced that the ride would be a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter, similar <b>to</b> <b>Saw</b> – The Ride. The ride was manufactured at the company's facilities in Germany before being shipped to Australia in forty-five [...] shipping containers. Construction of the ride was completed by Gerstlauer crews over seven weeks. The name of the attraction was revealed on the Friday the 13th of September 2013 as Abyss. The announcement was made on Friday the 13th due to the ride's horror theme. Abyss officially opened to the public on 1 November 2013 as the single biggest investment in the park's history.|$|E
500|$|Only those key {{cast and}} crew members who were {{involved}} in the film's ending were given the full script; the rest received only the first 88 pages. If a particular page was rewritten, the old page was shredded. Members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details. [...] Reportedly, [...] "four or five" [...] alternate endings were shot in order to keep the ending a surprise. [...] Bousman gave the actors freedom to change dialogue in the script. He said that 95% of the time, the actors went by the script, with about 5% being adlibs, which he said [...] "made all of the difference in the world". Hoffman said in an interview with Fangoria that they listened to fans' suggestions. For instance, instead of only showing the aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback, they would allow it to unfold as it happened. This was in contrast <b>to</b> <b>Saw,</b> in which most of the violence was implied off-screen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{juvenile}} wood type {{is produced}} by southern pine trees during their first 10 years of growth producing a significant volume of wood at tree center having inferior properties that decrease lumber value. Increased volumes of lumber are influenced by juvenile wood as intensive plantation silviculture increases early tree growth. Research has shown that knowledge of knot location in logs prior <b>to</b> <b>sawing</b> {{has the potential to}} significantly increase lumber value yield. Detection of juvenile and knot wood prior <b>to</b> <b>sawing</b> logs will allow application of sawing patterns that place these wood types into locations or products that have reduced influence on the final lumber value. This study tested an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) scanner for detection of juvenile and knot wood in southern pine. EIT and CT images were compared to determine the accuracy of juvenile and knot wood detection by EIT technology...|$|R

From the beginning, the mill assured employment to 22 or 25 men assigned <b>to</b> <b>sawing</b> wood, the drave, the stacking and transportation, {{and also a}} hundred woodcutters in the forest. Contracts cutting wood in the forest were usually granted to designated contractors including: Wellie Charest, Armand Plamondon, Josaphat Veillet and Bruno Veillet.|$|R
