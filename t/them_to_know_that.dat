I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one was bothering about it.|$|E

[...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital.

[...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family.

I want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

Jackson said, [...] "Getting back to that child, and giving the child what the child may have missed—the reassurance of a nourishing and accepting a love, a love that says you're special—is hard work. It can be scary but, like the song says, {{we have to deal}} with the past to live completely—and freely—in the present." [...] "Can't Be Stopped" [...] speaks of youth victimization, bigotry, and racial unity, [...] "directed at young people who are discouraged or discriminated against...

2500|$|In early 2011, Scherzinger {{announced}} that the musically diverse music she recorded had a bittersweet theme in which she titled the album, Killer Love, saying [...] "I wrote 'Killer Love' about a tortured love. Where you can't {{get enough of the}} love but it's not good for you. And I guess when the fans listen to the album, I want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a lot of the music that I chose had to do with my past experiences and relationships, where I've lost myself many times. It's [...] being lost and broken and in a very fearful, dark place and the process [...] coming out of that. It's a very empowering album but it comes from a place of heartbreak." [...] On March 2, 2011, Rap-Up revealed the cover art along with the track listing for Killer Love. On the standard cover, Scherzinger strikes a comfy pose, cracking a half-smile with a tuft of gray fur draped over her left shoulder. On October 20, 2011, the re-release cover was released with Scherzinger smiling coyly and draped lightly in a loose, unidentified, furry and wind-blown article of clothing similar to the first cover.|$|E

The performance was filmed at Rain Nightclub inside the Palms Casino Resort and was included in a MTV special titled [...] "I Am the Femme Fatale", which aired on April 3, 2011. Spears manager Larry Rudolph explained {{the choice of the}} location for the performances in an interview with MTV, saying, [...] "we chose the Palms because the Palms is where Britney has so much history.

2500|$|On 11 April, Miss Marcella Sherwood, an English missionary, fearing for {{the safety}} of her pupils, {{was on her way to}} shut the schools and send the roughly 600 Indian {{children}} home. While cycling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob, pulled to the ground by her hair, stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and left for dead. [...] She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh fort. After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his hands and knees. Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: [...] "Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too." [...] He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Miss Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him [...] "as the 'saviour' of the Punjab".|$|E
