30|$|Parasitic infections {{represent}} {{more than}} 40 % of the morbid load of tropical diseases {{in the world}} (Youssef and Driss 2007). Africa shares this situation in the intertropical belt, which constitutes a predirection for parasitic infections. Among these diseases, helminthiasis occupies a considerable position in tropical Africa. It affects more than 2 billion people in the world, among whom 300 million present serious infections and 155, 000 deaths are exposed to their direct or indirect effect each year (WHO 1999). In Cameroon, helminthiases {{are part of the}} most chronic parasitic diseases (Tchuem Tchuemt√© et al. 2001). Epidemiological surveys carried out gave some indications on the prevalence of the most frequent worms. More than 7 million people are infested by <b>trichocephalosis,</b> 6 million by ascaridiasis and 2 million by ankylostomiasis in tropical Africa. In spite of these observations, helminthiases nowadays have little interest besides diseases like the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis and malaria (PNLSHI 2010).|$|E
