5|$|As {{a popular}} and {{acceptable}} activity, botany {{had been taken}} up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.|$|E
5|$|Ross was {{the first}} {{governor}} to set aside a day for civic improvements, declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day, when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus is {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} was reassigned from Hazen's Brigade to the Middle Department on December 6, 1781. On this date, {{a portion}} of the regiment went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where they guarded prisoners taken at Yorktown. They were on this detail for 10 months with prisoners under guard at Lancaster, York and Reading. The most notable prisoner under Hazen's watch during this time was 20-year-old Captain Charles Asgill. On May 3, 1782, upon orders by Washington, he was selected <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> retaliation for the brutal summary execution of American Captain Joshua Huddy by the British. In November 1782 his life was spared after heartrending correspondence by his family and intervention by the Queen of France.|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{has had a}} long {{association}} with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uzès. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to Nîmes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the king's new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.|$|E

25|$|While {{effective}} at generating electricity, well-designed, and well-engineered, Holter Dam {{is considered an}} exceptionally unpleasant structure visually. In 1927, however, the Montana Legislature commissioned painter Ralph E. DeCamp to depict Holter Dam as one of four mural paintings <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the state's Law Library (located in the Montana State Capitol). Japanese photographer Toshio Shibata has also photographed the dam, and exhibited this work in 1997 in Chicago at the Museum of Contemporary Art.|$|E
25|$|The {{installation}} of Napoleon as First Consul and the French victory in Italy {{allowed for a}} rapprochement with Charles IV of Spain. While talks were underway to re-establish diplomatic relations, a traditional exchange of gifts took place. Charles received Versailles-manufactured pistols, dresses from the best Parisian dressmakers, jewels for the queen, and a fine set of armour for the newly reappointed Prime Minister, Manuel Godoy. In return Napoleon was offered sixteen Spanish horses from the royal stables, portraits of {{the king and queen}} by Goya, and the portrait that was to be commissioned from David. The French ambassador to Spain, Charles-Jean-Marie Alquier, requested the original painting from David on Charles' behalf. The portrait was <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the Royal Palace of Madrid as a token of the new relationship between the two countries. David, who had been an ardent supporter of the Revolution but had transferred his fervour to the new Consulate, was eager to undertake the commission.|$|E

500|$|Post-Gazette editors {{declined}} {{to publish the}} photo, looking for [...] "action shots" [...] instead, but Berman entered the image into contests where it took {{on a life of}} its own, winning a National Headliner Award. The photo was published in the October 2, 1964, issue of Life magazine. It is regarded as having changed the way that photographers look at sports, having shown the power of capturing a moment of reaction. It became one of three photos <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the lobby of the National Press Photographers Association headquarters, alongside Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima and the Hindenburg disaster. A copy now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|In 1842 Colt {{was convicted}} {{of the murder of}} a printer named Samuel Adams, to whom Colt owed money over the {{publication}} of a bookkeeping textbook. [...] Colt killed Adams with a hatchet the previous year in what he claimed was self-defense, but he had afterwards covered up the crime by disposing of the body. [...] When the body was discovered, Colt was the first suspect. [...] The trial became a sensation in the New York press, because of his family connections, the manner of disposal, and Colt's somewhat arrogant demeanor in the courtroom. [...] Colt was found guilty and sentenced <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> 1842, but committed suicide on the morning of his execution.|$|E

500|$|In Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, Danforth is {{depicted}} as the leading judicial figure overseeing the Salem trials. [...] William Stoughton is not a character in the play, and Miller portrays Danforth as an honest but domineering and selfish judge, under whose authority many are imprisoned and sentenced to hang. When John Proctor, an accused, defies his authority {{at the end of}} the play by refusing to lie and sign a public confession saying that he is a witch and accusing others, he is mercilessly sentenced <b>to</b> <b>hang.</b> <b>In</b> an introduction to the play, Miller wrote that he had combined several persons and made other changes to the historical characters for dramatic purposes.|$|E
500|$|Multi-panel Netherlandish {{paintings}} {{fell out}} of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism {{came to the fore}} in the mid-16th century. Later the iconoclasm of the Reformation deemed them offensive, and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries. As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that [...] "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings".|$|E
500|$|In its Euro Plus Monitor Report 2012, {{published}} in November 2012, the Lisbon Council {{finds that the}} eurozone has slightly improved its overall health. With the exception of Greece, all eurozone crisis countries are either close {{to the point where}} they have achieved the major adjustment or are likely to get there over the course of 2013. Portugal and Italy are expected to progress to the turnaround stage in spring 2013, possibly followed by Spain in autumn, while the fate of Greece continues <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> the balance. Overall, the authors suggest that if the eurozone gets through the current acute crisis and stays on the reform path [...] "it could eventually emerge from the crisis as the most dynamic of the major Western economies".|$|E
