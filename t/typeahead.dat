50|$|<b>Typeahead</b> has {{its roots}} in the age of typewriters. The IBM Selectric typewriter, first {{released}} in 1961, had a mechanical key lockout feature designed to smooth out typists' irregular keystrokes that, to many users, felt like <b>typeahead.</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of {{keyboard}} buffers {{is sometimes}} {{known from the}} user experience side as <b>typeahead.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{keyboard}} had {{a control}} key, a CAPS lock key, and three function keys. TRSDOS supported a <b>typeahead</b> feature with an 80 character key buffer.|$|E
50|$|This feature, or {{variations}} thereof, {{has also}} {{been referred to as}} Autocomplete, search as you type, filter/find as you type (FAYT), incremental search, <b>typeahead</b> search, inline search, instant search, word wheeling, and other names as well.|$|E
50|$|In some network operations, {{one might}} attempt to {{dispatch}} information over a network, regardless whether the receiving program manages to keep up, using the recipient's <b>typeahead</b> functions. However, {{as this is}} far too reliant on the specifications of the computer with which one is communicating, it is not often used.|$|E
5000|$|Achieving true <b>typeahead</b> {{requires}} {{maintaining a}} so-called [...] "typeahead buffer"—a FIFO queue, for instance—whose role {{it is to}} store {{a limited amount of}} keyboard input until it is called for. Installing such a buffer can be done at both the hardware and the software levels; most modern operating systems, such as Unix, implement this using software, calling kernel interrupts.|$|E
50|$|Bootstrap {{comes with}} several JavaScript {{components}} {{in the form of}} jQuery plugins. They provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields. In version 2.0, the following JavaScript plugins are supported: Modal, Dropdown, Scrollspy, Tab, Tooltip, Popover, Alert, Button, Collapse, Carousel and <b>Typeahead.</b>|$|E
50|$|For example, a disk {{interrupt}} {{signals the}} completion of a data transfer from or to the disk peripheral; a process waiting to read or write a file starts up again. As another example, a power-off interrupt predicts or requests a loss of power, allowing the computer equipment to perform an orderly shut-down. Also, interrupts are used in <b>typeahead</b> features for buffering events like keystrokes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Typeahead</b> is {{a feature}} of {{computers}} and software (and some typewriters) that enables users to continue typing regardless of program or computer operation—the user may type in whatever speed is desired, and if the receiving software is busy {{at the time it}} will be called to handle this later. Often this means that keystrokes entered will not be displayed on the screen immediately. This programming technique for handling uses what is known as a keyboard buffer.|$|E
50|$|The {{keyboard}} ports {{are located}} at address DF00 (hex), or 57088 (decimal). BASIC programs typically poll for real-time keyboard input {{by using the}} PEEK and POKE commands at that address. Because the keyboard lacks any way to generate an interrupt, {{it is not possible}} to implement a <b>typeahead</b> buffer. The keyboard matrix also lacks any diodes at the intersections of the matrix. This leads to problems when reading certain combinations of keys pressed simultaneously. The matrix was designed to allow only the shift, control and shift-lock keys to be pressed simultaneously with another key. The keyswitches themselves were originally manufactured by Cherry.|$|E
50|$|The {{video display}} RAM was not memory-mapped {{as it had}} been on the {{previous}} Models I and III. Rather, whenever a program called functions requiring video RAM to be modified, TRSDOS executed code that switched the 2KB bank of video RAM into Z-80 address space (the upper 2KB of hexadecimal F400 - FFFF). The keyboard matrix and <b>typeahead</b> buffer also occupied this address range. While this freed 1920 bytes of Z-80 address space, it was marginally slower than writing directly into video RAM. The video hardware supported characters in reversed video and Model I/III style block graphics. A 40 character wide display mode was available a using double-width raster image. An alternate character set was available which included the entire Greek alphabet and special symbols.|$|E
