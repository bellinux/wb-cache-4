The woman's arm is resting of the man’s shoulder, acknowledging their close relationship and her need for protection and intimacy. The serene and contemplative pose of the couple contrasts sharply with the contorsions of the half uprooted oak tree, which is itself in opposition with the verticality of the lush pine tree on the left. This irregular and asymmetrical pictorial construction - one linked with the post-Baroque aesthetic of the previous century- was fairly rare in Friedrich's work, often characterized by regular geometric arrangements.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for better diff erential diagnosis of macular holes in comparison with biomicroscopical fundus analysis. Methods We reviewed the fi les of 25 eyes of 24 patients who were diagnosed as having a macular hole on OCT examination and biomicroscopical fundus analysis. Each eye underwent six radial 3 -mm OCT scans centered on the macula, one 6 -mm vertical and one 6 -mm horizontal scan. Retinal thickness was measured at the foveal center and 750 &m from the <b>center,</b> <b>vertically,</b> and horizontally.

50|$|The third {{insignia}} originated {{when all}} Marine Corps aviation Groups redesigned their insignias to inverted triangles. The new insignia {{began with a}} green triangle and had a bald eagle with up stretched wings grasping a globe and anchor in a stylized rendition of the Marine Corps insignia. An arcing scarlet banner emblazoned with “MWSG 47” in golden letters {{was placed in the}} background of the eagle’s wings.The fourth and final insignia, adopted in 2011, is also an inverted triangle. Across the top is a black strip with golden letters spelling “MARINE WING SUPPORT GROUP”. <b>Centered</b> <b>vertically</b> on a scarlet background is a green runway with white markings and the white numerals “47”. The last portion of the insignia is a depiction of a bald eagle (viewed from its right side) gliding to a landing on the runway.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{heterogeneities}} on macrodispersion in porous media were investigated using numerical simulations. Cases involving a single heterogeneity were investigated initially. The size {{and location of}} the input source strongly influenced {{the magnitude of the}} longitudinal macrodispersion coefficient. A smaller solute input source decreased the longitudinal macrodispersion coefficient when the source was located up gradient from the heterogeneity and was not <b>centered</b> (<b>vertically).</b> A vertical flow component reduced the magnitude of the longitudinal macrodispersion coefficient in all cases, and asymptotic dispersion coefficients were approached at an earlier time than those without vertical flow. Dispersion in stratified porous media was also simulated. Cases involving both a vertical flow component and no vertical flow were studied. The asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity values are in close agreement with stochastic solutions, as long as certain conditions are met. Transient flow conditions were also shown to strongly influence dispersion...|$|R

Scarlet and yellow are the colors associated with Air Defense Artillery. The blue stylized wings suggest the sky and flight {{in reference to the}} air defense function and the arrowheads denote accuracy and aerial warfare. The X-shape formed by the wings refer to the Roman numeral ten, the unit’s numerical designation. The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally approved for the 10th Air Defense Artillery Brigade on 5 January 1984. It was redesignated for the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command with the description updated effective 17 October 2011.|$|R
40|$|A small {{fraction}} of WFC 3 /IR observations exhibit an anomaly known as banding. The banding anomaly {{is characterized by a}} rectangular region in which background pixel values are a few DN above or below the rest of the image. This region is <b>centered</b> <b>vertically,</b> and extends horizontally across the entire image and into the reference pixels. The height of the band varies from image to image, but is always either 64, 128, 256, or 512 pixels. Banding is not obviously seen until the third readout of an affected exposure. Furthermore, {{there appears to be a}} causal connection between the height of the band in a given banded image and the readout mode of the IR image(s) that preceded it. In this report, we describe this anomaly in detail, using surveys of preflight ground-test and on-orbit data, speculate on possible causes, and suggest strategies that observers can use to mitigate the effects of banding...|$|R
