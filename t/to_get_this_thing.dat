6000|$|I have {{hitherto}} carefully restricted myself, {{in speaking}} of exchange, {{to the use}} of the term [...] "advantage;" [...] but that term includes two ideas: the advantage, namely, of getting what we need, and that of getting what we wish for. Three-fourths of the demands existing in the world are romantic; founded on visions, idealisms, hopes, and affections; and the regulation of the purse is, in its essence, regulation of the imagination and the heart. Hence, the right discussion of the nature of price is a very high metaphysical and psychical problem; sometimes to be solved only in a passionate manner, as by David in his counting the price of the water of the well by the gate of Bethlehem; but its first conditions are the following:--The price of anything is the quantity of labour given by the person desiring it, in order to obtain possession of it. This price depends on four variable quantities. A. The quantity of wish the purchaser has for the thing; opposed to [Greek: a], the quantity of wish the seller has to keep it. B. The quantity of labour the purchaser can afford, to obtain the thing; opposed to [Greek: b], the quantity of labour the seller can afford, to keep it. These quantities are operative only in excess; i.e., the quantity of wish (A) means the quantity of wish for this thing, above wish for other things; and the quantity of work (B) means the quantity which can be spared <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> from the quantity needed to get other things.|$|E

5000|$|Forster was {{an early}} {{vigorous}} advocate of a ban on cockfighting in Louisiana. In 1990, {{with the support of}} animal rights activists, he proposed two bills, one to ban the practice outright and the other to reclassify fowl as “animals” so that they could gain protection through laws banning animal cruelty. [...] "We've been trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> passed for years, and we'll probably try again ...," [...] Forster said.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{decision}} to fire head coach Jim Harbaugh, {{there was a large}} negative outcry from the media and the 49ers fan base. In a press conference addressing the issue, Jed York was quoted as saying, “It’s up to us to make sure we compete for and win Super Bowls. That’s our only goal. We don’t raise division championship banners, we don’t raise NFC Championship banners. We raise Super Bowl banners. And whenever we don’t deliver that, I hope that you will hold me directly responsible and accountable for it. And we look forward <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> back on track.” [...] Commenting on York's ability to manage the critical relationship between the general manager and the head coach, Michael Rosenberg wrote in Sports Illustrated, [...] "he failed completely." [...] Rosenberg also described York's impact on the broader 49ers organization, noting that [...] "York has created a culture that encourages selfishness, weakness and back-stabbing." [...] Throughout the season, there were numerous leaks to the media from within the 49ers organization criticizing Coach Harbaugh. San Jose Mercury News columnist Tim Kawakami noted [...] "York and Manager, Trent Baalke were the primary sources for the off-the-record disclosures that undercut Harbaugh’s tenure." [...] It has been reported that York and Harbaugh had a clash in the personality department. The animosity between the two was exacerbated by an alleged clash between them midway through the 2014 season when York supposedly walked into a meeting Harbaugh was holding with the players. When Harbaugh noticed York walking into the meeting, he allegedly told York that the meeting was for [...] "men only".|$|R
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with The Ex-Man, despite an ongoing [...] "huge legal battle" [...] with Bell and Cazares, former bassist-guitarist Christian Olde Wolbers {{stated that he}} has been [...] "trying to reach out and try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> reunion <b>thing</b> happening." [...] He added, [...] "There would be nothing better for this band [...] to reconcile our differences, fucking write a killer record, which I know we can, and fucking we would be doing really big tours. My passion for playing and what we have invested in this band is very big, and I know it's really big for Dino as well, 'cause he started it with Raymond back in the day." [...] More fuel to the possibility of a reunion with the [...] "classic" [...] lineup of Bell, Cazares, Wolbers and Herrera was added later that month, when Wolbers posted an image on his Instagram account, suggesting Fear Factory's official website was [...] "under construction." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The public gets a {{different}} story from the other guys - Slash, Duff, Matt - who have their own agendas. The original intentions between Paul and myself were that Paul was {{going to help me}} {{for as long as it}} took <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> together in whatever capacity that he could help me in. So when he first was brought into this, he was brought in as a writer to work with Slash.".|$|E
50|$|Rendell later {{elaborated}} on {{his early}} success. “In those days {{you could get}} an old penny and sell it for 10 cents; you could actually make money doing that.

I could sort through large quantities. I was 12.” He soon branched out into the area of American colonial coinage and political memorabilia, and later wrote several reference works in this field.|$|E

I had a good restart there at the end and holding off Kyle to try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> into Miami. We're racing for a championship now. We did exactly what we had to do.

Following a disastrous 5-11 season in his first season with the Seahawks, Jim Mora was fired on January 9, 2010.

5000|$|Newsnight {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} Jimmy Savile's paedophile activities immediately after his death on 29 October 2011. MacKean was the reporter and Meirion Jones was the producer; MacKean was very unhappy when the report was not transmitted before Christmas 2011 and tributes to Savile were broadcast on the BBC. She alleged that her editor Peter Rippon tried to [...] "kill" [...] the Savile story [...] "by making impossible editorial demands". She told a Panorama programme in October 2012: [...] "All I {{can say is that}} it was an abrupt change in tone from, you know, one day 'excellent, let's prepare <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> on air' to 'hold on'."

5000|$|This {{method of}} {{composition}} is interesting {{and full of}} suspense, to be sure, but it has certain disadvantages of which most writers have never even dreamed....sometimes, when thirty or forty lines have been set, it becomes obvious that the piece is just no good.

It’s okay, we’re going to be just fine. I think in my history of qualifying here, this is still about 10-spots better than normal. We have a fast pit crew, the car is a lot better than it was in practice and I think for all these Xfinity guys, I think they’re all excited about the race. It’s one of our strong points at JGR and I’m going to have some fun on Sunday.” Kasey Kahne wrecked his car {{in the first round of}} qualifying and had to go to a backup car. Because he made a qualifying run, he started from the rear of the field. Speaking on the incident, he said that he [...] "ruined a pretty good car, a really good car, actually.

6000|$|... "Yes, this cave is man's work! I am sure of it. It is not natural. I {{wondered}} how {{there could be}} such a cave {{on the top of}} a hill. It was originally a gorge, and they have roofed it over, and the bottom of the basin has been cut out to make it deeper. It was made so that it could be filled up with water, and roofed over so that nobody should know there was any water here, unless they came on it by means of the passage from our caves. That passage must have been blocked up. As for the great opening in the side of the cave, the rocks have fallen in there--that is easy enough to see. Yes, men made this cave and filled it with water, and if the water were high enough to cover the handle of that machine, as it was when I struck it, it must also have been high enough to cover up this stone mound. The lake was intended to cover and hide that mound. And then, to make the hiding of it doubly sure, the men who built all this totally covered up the lake so that nobody would know it was here. And then they built that valve apparatus, which was also submerged, so that they could let out the water when they wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at <b>this</b> stone <b>thing,</b> whatever it is. What a scheme to hide anything! Even if anybody discovered the lake, which would not be likely until some part of the cave fell in, they would not know it was anything but a lake when they did see it. And as for letting off the water, nobody but the people who knew about it could possibly do that, unless somebody was fool enough to take the cold bath I was obliged to take, and even then it would have been one chance in a hundred that he found the lever, and would know how to turn it when he did find it. <b>This</b> whole <b>thing</b> is the work of the ancient South Americans, and I imagine that this stone mound is the tomb of one of their kings." ...|$|R

Couples that were described as likely to get tested were generally in a committed relationship that was in a transition. Several types of transitions that were cited to favor couples testing were mentioned. One was recommitting after a break-up: “That’s a good time to bring it up.

Ceasing condom use in a committed relationship was another transition that was cited as being an appropriate time to utilize CHTC: “Because if they went through that process of using condoms then at the same time they’re still being protective of each other, and testing is a good way to know if to move away from that protection” (female). Another transition was planning for a deeper commitment or to have children: “I would stay future planning would be a reason to, like if they plan on getting married, they plan on having children” (female).|$|E
