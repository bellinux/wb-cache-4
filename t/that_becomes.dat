Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> even more prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies {{are used as}} food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|In glomeromycetes (formerly zygomycetes), haploid hyphae of two {{individuals}} fuse, forming a gametangium, a specialized cell structure <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> a fertile gamete-producing cell. The gametangium develops into a zygospore, a thick-walled spore {{formed by the}} union of gametes. When the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis, generating new haploid hyphae, which may then form asexual sporangiospores. These sporangiospores allow the fungus to rapidly disperse and germinate into new genetically identical haploid fungal mycelia.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> the body and lophophore, a rear lobe <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> the pedicle, and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E

5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent.

5|$|Lactarius xanthogalactus {{has nearly}} {{identical}} microscopic features to L.vinaceorufescens, but macroscopically, {{it does not}} have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of L.vinaceorufescens, and it grows on the ground under oak. Another lookalike is L.colorascens, but it may be distinguished from L.vinaceorufescens by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. L.chrysorrheus is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E

5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E

Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap <b>that</b> <b>becomes</b> orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E
