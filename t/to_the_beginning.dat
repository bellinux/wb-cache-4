5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the 20th century. After a {{possible}} precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907.

On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beginning</b> of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
