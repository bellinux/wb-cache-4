India, in the past has condemned all acts of aggression and has also supported the United Nations' peace-keeping activities.

After leaving the UN, he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation in 2007 to work on international development. In 2012, Annan was the UN–Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria, to help find a resolution to ongoing conflict there. Annan quit after becoming frustrated with the UN's lack of progress with regard to conflict resolution.

25|$|Born in Kumasi, Annan went on {{to study}} {{economics}} at Macalester College, international relations from the Graduate Institute Geneva and management at MIT. Annan joined the UN in 1962, working for the World Health Organization's Geneva office. He {{went on to}} work in several capacities at the UN Headquarters including serving as the Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping between March 1992 and December 1996. He was appointed as the Secretary-General on 13 December 1996 by <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> later confirmed by the General Assembly, making him the first office holder to be elected from the UN staff itself. He was re-elected {{for a second term}} in 2001, and was succeeded as Secretary-General by Ban Ki-moon on 1 January 2007.|$|E
25|$|Following the Republic of Kosovo's {{formation}} of the Kosovo Security Forces in January 2009, he sent protest letters both to the and NATO Secretaries-General. The letter states that Serbia views those forces as an illegal paramilitary organisation that constitutes {{a threat to the}} country’s security and a danger to peace and stability in the Western Balkans. Tadić drew {{attention to the fact that}} the KSF were formed on the basis of the Ahtisaari Plan that was never adopted by <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> added that the creation of these forces constitutes a breach of the Serbian Constitution and international law, which is why they should be disbanded. He called for the demilitarisation of Kosovo.|$|E
25|$|The UN {{has played}} various roles during the {{conflict}} and peace process: a military role through its observer mission (UNOMIG); dual diplomatic roles through <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> {{the appointment of a}} Special Envoy, succeeded by a Special Representative to the Secretary-General; a humanitarian role (UNHCR and UNOCHA); a development role (UNDP); a human rights role (UNHCHR); and a low-key capacity and confidence-building role (UNV). The UN’s position has been {{that there will be no}} forcible change in international borders. Any settlement must be freely negotiated and based on autonomy for Abkhazia legitimised by referendum under international observation once the multiethnic population has returned. According to Western interpretations the intervention did not contravene international law since Georgia, as a sovereign state, had the right to secure order on its territory and protect its territorial integrity.|$|E

25|$|The {{triennial}} election of five judges to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{was held on}} 10 November, 22 November and 13 December 2011. In {{the first round of}} voting, the General Assembly and the Security Council concurrently and independently elected Giorgio Gaja (Italy), Hisashi Owada (Japan), Peter Tomka (Slovakia), and Xue Hanqin (China), but the two organs were deadlocked between two African candidates for the fifth available seat. Eventually the two organs elected Julia Sebutinde (Uganda), who had been endorsed by the African Union. The five judges elected in this session will serve nine-year terms beginning on 6 February 2012. A by-election to the ICJ was held on 27 April 2012; <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the General Assembly concurrently elected Dalveer Bhandari (India) over Florentino Feliciano (Philippines) by a vote of 122 and 13, respectively to replace Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh who resigned from the Court in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Aiken was Minister for Finance {{for three}} years {{following}} the war and was involved in economic post–war development in the industrial, agricultural, educational and other spheres. However, it was during his two periods as Minister for External Affairs—1951 to 1954, and 1957 to 1969-that Aiken fulfilled his enormous political potential. As Foreign Minister he adopted where possible an independent stance for Ireland at the United Nations and other international forums such as the Council of Europe. Despite {{a great deal of}} opposition, both at home and abroad, he stubbornly asserted the right of smaller UN member countries to discuss the representation of communist China at the General Assembly. Unable to bring the issue of the partition of Ireland to the UN, because of Britain's veto on <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> unwillingness of other Western nations to interfere in what they saw as British affairs at that time (the US taking a more ambiguous position), Aiken ensured that Ireland vigorously defended the rights of small nations such as Tibet and Hungary, nations whose problems he felt Ireland could identify with and had a moral obligation to help.|$|E
25|$|India {{was among}} the {{original}} members of the United Nations that signed the Declaration by United Nations at Washington on 1 January 1942 and also participated in the United Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco from 25 April to 26 June 1945. As {{a founding member of}} the United Nations, India strongly supports the purposes and principles of the UN and has made significant contributions to implementing the goals of the Charter, and the evolution of the UN's specialised programmes and agencies. India is a charter member of the United Nations and participates in all of its specialised agencies and organisations. India has contributed troops to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Korea, Egypt and the Congo in its earlier years and in Somalia, Angola, Haiti, Liberia, Lebanon and Rwanda in recent years, and more recently in the South Sudan conflict. India has been a member of the UN Security Council for six terms (a total of 12 years), and was a member for the term 2011–12. India is a member of the G4 group of nations who back each other in seeking a permanent seat on <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>council</b> <b>and</b> advocate in favour of the reformation of the UNSC.

500|$|With the {{enlargement}} of the United Nations membership and increasing self-confidence among the new members, going {{hand in hand with}} processes of decolonization, old structures and procedures were increasingly challenged. The imbalance between the number of seats in <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the total number of member States became evident, and the only significant reform of the Security Council occurred in 1965: this included an increase in the non-permanent membership from six to 10 members.
