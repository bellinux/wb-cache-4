5|$|Unlike {{some other}} West Bank localities, {{unemployment}} {{is a minor}} issue in Jifna. However, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> is low because of the unstable political situation in the Palestinian territories, Israeli checkpoints, the West Bank barrier and the 2006 freezing by Israel of funds to the Palestinian territories—although the latter no longer applies to the West Bank.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} has a high {{proportion}} of public servants, the Commonwealth Government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra, although no longer the majority employer. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. Property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively restrictive development regulations.|$|E

5|$|Levels of {{unemployment}} in Felling are high. Only 52.4% {{of the total}} working age population are in employment, as compared to 61.7% in the borough overall. Around 10% of residents claim Jobseeker's Allowance; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough.

5|$|Although {{these laws}} were relaxed over time, Emperor Wu renewed the state's {{persecution}} of merchants when in 119 BCE {{he made it}} illegal for registered merchants to purchase land. If they violated this law, their land and slaves would be confiscated by the state. The effectiveness of this law is questionable, since contemporary Han writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land. A merchant who owned property worth a thousand catties of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant. Such a fortune was one hundred times larger than <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households. Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market {{and cost of}} living is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, India's growth reached 7.5%, which will double <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> in a decade.

States have large responsibilities over their economies. The average annual growth rates (2007-12) for Uttarakhand (13.66%), Bihar (10.15%) or Jharkhand (9.85%) were higher than for West Bengal (6.24%), Maharashtra (7.84%), Odisha (7.05%), Punjab (6.85%) or Assam (5.88%).

5|$|Mississippi was {{the poorest}} {{state in the}} U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta {{counties}} {{were some of the}} poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> per white household in 1949 was $690 ($ in 2013 dollars). For black families, the figure was $462 ($ in 2013 dollars). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890, when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 {{people working in}} the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland.

5|$|To {{increase}} their incomes, many farmers have diversified; <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> from non-farming business activities on farms in Wales in 2013/2014 was £4,900. Tourism-related activities accounted {{for much of}} this; these included bed and breakfast accommodation, self-catering accommodation in redundant outbuildings or purpose-built units, bunkhouses for walkers and provision of food-related services in cafés, restaurants, farm shops, pick-your-own and farmer's markets. Indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint-balling, laser-combat games, pony trekking, mountain biking and many other activities. Caravans, camp sites and parking provide alternative uses for land, and wind turbines can provide extra income from land still farmed in the normal way.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many canals, where navvies {{were brought}} into the {{neighbourhood}} {{to carry out the}} work, the Earl employed local men on the project, most of them already employed by him, and a clergyman praised him for this when writing in 1808, as it led to much less disruption, but provided increased income for those who worked on the scheme. Wages rose from 8 or 9 shillings (40-45p) per week to 14 or 15 shillings (70-75p). During his life, the Earl invested some £100,000 in waterways, some in his native county of Sussex, but also in attempts to build a canal from London to Portsmouth. Between 1802 and 1831, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> from the canal was around £550 per year. Competition arrived in 1859, when the Mid-Sussex Railway opened a line from Horsham through Pulborough to Petworth. Traffic declined, and by the 1880s, the navigation was no longer used by commercial boats, although it was not officially abandoned until 1936.|$|E
