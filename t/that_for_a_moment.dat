500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale was going to be like. Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either full frame or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> you feel you must have missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E

Don Benito, on the other hand, shakes with fear. Apparently, Babo tests the blade across his palm, and for Delano the sound {{is that of a}} man humbling himself, while Cereno hears [...] "the black man warning him: if you make one move toward candor, I will cut your throat." [...] When Delano notices that the shaving cloth covering Don Benito is the Spanish flag, he finds this use an indignity <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> gives him occasion to see in Babo a [...] "headsman" [...] and in Don Benito [...] "a man at the block", but quickly reassures himself that blacks are like children and therefore fond of bright colors, so that nothing is wrong with scene.

Today, notwithstanding local school boards in various backwoods and boondocks of the United States, no educated person doubts the truth of evolution. Nor do they doubt the force of natural selection. Natural selection is not the only driver and guide of evolution.

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{theoretically}} constructed case of private equity in the UK anno 2007. The theory at play is the theoretical edifice Luc Boltanski has been developing {{for more than two}} decades and which concerns the underlying architectonics of how social reality is constituted, challenged and stabilized. We thus interweave the story of private equity with the evolution of Boltanski's work: from the six-world model to the widening of the critical notion of 'test' and the outline of a new 'connexionist' capitalist logic, and finally to his most recent attempts at reconnecting his sociology of critical practices with a more traditional critical sociology. Now that Boltanski's work from the 1990 s is being increasingly used and critiqued in our field, we believe it is important to engage with his more recent writings which, while less easy to 'apply', have acquired more depth, complexity and a change in focus in response to some of the more pertinent critique. The case of private equity is of particular interest in <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>moment</b> it became the 'face' of 21 st century capitalism, something which is significant in the broadening of our discussion into the possibilities and the limits of critique under a financialized capitalism...|$|R
40|$|Emotions {{are gaining}} an {{increasingly}} {{prominent role in}} the study of International Relations. As a relatively new frontier, there is still considerable work to be done in streamlining various efforts into a systematic study. These efforts have largely circled on describing the cognitive and action potential of specific emotions, such as anger, fear and trust. This thesis is concerned with an extreme emotion, the emotion of rage. I stress the action potential of revenge, as well as the cognitive elements at play here, most specifically the issue of abrupt changes to morality. I use both Greek and Nietzschean philosophy to construct a binary approach to rage that acknowledges both the violent and bloody manifestation - we still witness today - as well as the silent, non-violent rancour <b>that</b> searches <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportune <b>moment</b> before exploding into action...|$|R
500|$|Nurmi {{enjoyed the}} Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, {{crediting}} the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924. He had a versatile diet, {{although he had}} practiced vegetarianism {{between the ages of}} 15 and 21. Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be [...] "taciturn", [...] "stony-faced" [...] and [...] "stubborn". He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his [...] "sarcastic sense of humour" [...] among the small circles he knew. Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak, Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media, stating later on his 75th birthday, [...] "orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry." [...] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi [...] "is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great <b>that</b> never <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> does he show his feelings." [...] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him Suuri vaikenija (The Great Silent One), and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: [...] "Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama." ...|$|R

500|$|Tipping the Velvet {{was adapted}} into a BBC {{television}} drama serial {{of the same}} name, originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002. It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions, and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan, Keeley Hawes as Kitty, Anna Chancellor as Diana, and Jodhi May as Florence. The BBC had previously adapted Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow, but none had been so explicit. Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut. Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book. Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role, despite her avowed heterosexuality: [...] "To counteract any hard-core sex within it, there's a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life.

500|$|As the Marines {{formed into}} a horseshoe-shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura's {{battalion}} {{began a series}} of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below {{the east side of the}} ridge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops hoisted a [...] "regimental" [...] gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which [...] "could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese," [...] however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the Paramarines swept forward, killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson's command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William J. McKennan, [...] "The Japanese attack was almost constant, like <b>a</b> rain <b>that</b> subsides <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and then pours the harder...

40|$|A new Opera. Composer: Michael Berkeley Libretto: Ian McEwan, {{commissioned}} by Music Theatre Wales. A minimalist and kinetic scenographic exploration. This was a development beyond the static scene or referenced 'place' towards a more sensory investigation {{of how the}} fluid reconfigurations of scenic space, the animated drawing of space through the manipulation of basic scenic elements might enhance the emotional narrative led by the music. A Scenographic dance. The starting premise {{was to take the}} emotional subtext from each scene and construct a physical / visual manifestation of these using very simple divisions of the scenic space. The interaction of the performers with the space restriction/ release /open field/ maze/ stage depth or shallow stage performed a spatial narrative that spoke more clearly of emotional circumstance rather than the physical location that the libretto had asked for. Significantly it was in the movement between each of these states that the scenography and the music achieved a more visceral connection with the viewer as the stage space was re-moulded always under construction and never finished, the possibility for further development establishing both an expectation and curiosity <b>that</b> settled <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before mutating once more.

500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, European Physical Journal B [© Springer-Verlag]. It is available at: [URL] polarised neutron scattering investigation has been carried out on a powder sample of CuGeO 3 within the temperature range of 1. 5 K to 600 K. The magnetic scattering has been separated from all other contributions by using polarised neutrons and polarisation analysis and placed onto an absolute scale. At low temperatures the long wavelength components of the paramagnetic response are suppressed consistent with the formation of Cu dimers in which the magnetic moments are correlated antiferromagnetically. This form of the scattering persists to temperatures well above the dimerisation temperature Tsp 14 K. However as the temperature is raised the intensity of the long wavelength spin fluctuations increases and above 150 K they are the dominant feature in the wave vector dependence of the response. At all temperatures the observed scattering extrapolates smoothly to the Q = 0 value given by the uniform susceptibility. Consequently the thermal variation of the uniform susceptibility arises from the evolution of the long wavelength magnetic fluctuations. At large wave vectors the energy dependence of the scattering revealed that the response occurs below 16 meV in agreement with the reported maximum magnetic excitation energy at the zone boundary in the ground state. However the total magnetic scattering is signi cantly less than <b>that</b> expected <b>for</b> <b>a</b> local <b>moment</b> system suggesting that the spectrum of thermal and quantum fluctuations overlap...|$|R
