40|$|Within {{the three}} years of the project {{duration}} it was possible to reach the goals of the project. After primarily problems concerning the instrumental development of the flow-through cell a fully automated voltammetric system will be available within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>month.</b> <b>The</b> automation concludes the sample pre-treatment, the stripping voltammetric measurement and the data analysis. The methodological developments were concentrated on the adsorptive stripping voltammetry. It was possible to divide the total reaction (complexation and adsorption) into its single reactions. Furthermore all complex systems used were classified into two main reaction types. As a consequence of these results an easy optimisation of the parameters for the flow through voltammetric determination is possible. A series of elements were observed due to an analysis in the flow through voltammetric device as uranium and molybdenum with different ligands as well as copper, titanium, cobalt and nickel. The new development simultaneous determination of uranium, antimony and molybdenum was also transferred to the flow system. The possibilities, occurring from electrolyte exchange, enable particularly the speciation analysis of elements. Procedures for the speciation of arsenic, selenium and chromium were developed: Additionally the electrolyte exchange can be used advantageously to reduce the matrix effect of interfering organic sample components. In several cases as for example the anodic stripping voltammetric determination of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper in one run can be performed by means of a calibration instead of the time consuming standard addition method.

The solar community is making good use of the increased activity through coordinated observations, both in space and on the ground. Ground-based measurements will provide crucial context observations and complementary measurements of the high-energy p,,ocesses which HESSI will observe; vector magnetographs will provide information on the morphology and strength of active region magnetic fields. At the time of the launch of HESSI, we will provide scientific data to the community with the MSFC vector magnetograph and will use the facilities to enhance the educational experience of the local community. In the meantime, to raise public consciousness about the solar cycle and to prepare for HESSI observations, we have prepared lesson plans and activities which are currently being distributed via the internet.
