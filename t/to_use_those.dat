5|$|From the 19th century, deputies {{were hired}} in larger areas {{to assist the}} sheriffs. Following the democratization in 1814, the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had the primary {{responsibility}} for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large {{increase in the number}} of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Dąbrowski Legion {{was first}} used against Austrians and their allies in Italy. In March 1797 it garrisoned Mantua, {{and by the end}} of the month it took part in its first combat during the Ten Days of Brescia. By the end of April the ranks of the Legion had swelled to 5,000. At that time Dąbrowski lobbied for a plan to push through to the Polish territories in Galicia, but that was {{eventually}} rejected by Napoleon who instead decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> troops on the Italian front. In April, the Legion took part in quelling the uprising in Verona, known as Veronese Easters. The Treaty of Leoben signed that month, which promised peace between Austrians and French, was a blow to Polish morale, but Dąbrowski correctly assumed that it would not last.|$|E

50|$|Stamped {{concrete}} is concrete that is patterned and/or textured or embossed {{to resemble}} brick, slate, flagstone, stone, tile, wood, {{and various other}} patterns and textures. Stamped concrete is commonly used for patios, sidewalks, driveways, pool decks, and interior flooring. The ability of stamped concrete to resemble other building materials makes stamped concrete a less expensive alternative <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>those</b> other authentic materials such as stone, slate or brick.|$|R

25|$|The US Coast Guard removed {{some of the}} ship’s {{equipment}} {{before its}} transfer to the Philippine Navy and plans <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> equipment as spare parts for the other US Coast Guard ships. Among those that were removed are the AN/SPS-40 air surface search radar, Phalanx CIWS, and two Mk.38 M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain guns. In return, the US Coast Guard began procuring and installing the safe-to-sail navigation equipment, radar systems and additional electronics that the Philippines requested {{as part of its}} transfer support case. The Philippine Navy installed a 25 mm chain gun, two 20 mm guns, and six mounted 50-caliber guns as replacement for the equipment removed.|$|E

25|$|Earth has not {{remained}} the same since its planetary formation 4.5 billion years ago. Continents have formed, broken up, and collided, offering new opportunities for and barriers to the dispersal of life. The redox state of the atmosphere and the oceans has changed, as indicated by isotope data. Fluctuating quantities of inorganic compounds such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, methane, and oxygen have been driven by life evolving new biological metabolisms to make these chemicals and have driven the evolution of new metabolisms <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> chemicals. Earth acquired a magnetic field about 3.4 Ga that has undergone a series of geomagnetic reversals {{on the order of}} millions of years. The surface temperature is in constant fluctuation, falling in glaciations and Snowball Earth events due to ice-albedo feedback, rising and melting due to volcanic outgassing, and stabilizing due to silicate weathering feedback.|$|E
25|$|The over is a {{fundamental}} consideration in the tactical planning of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has only six legal balls to bowl before he must hand the ball to another bowler, he typically plans <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> six balls {{to set up a}} pattern of play designed to get a batsman out. For example, he may bowl the first few balls with the same line, length, or spin. He intends to tempt the batsman into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batsman takes the bait, the bowler can then follow up with a variation designed to hit the wicket, or a ball that is intended to induce a mistake from a batsman who is still in aggressive run-scoring mode, which will result in him being caught out.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Argentine Army Aviation {{deployed}} three A109As to the Falkland Islands {{during the}} Falklands War. They operated with the helicopter fleet (9 UH-1H, 2 CH-47C and 2 Pumas) in reconnaissance and liaison roles. One of the helicopters was destroyed {{on the ground}} by a British Harrier attack; the others were captured and sent to Europe in HMS Fearless (L10). The British Army Air Corps decided <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> helicopters in domestic operations (being flown by 8 Flight AAC to support SAS regiment deployments in the UK), alongside two additional A109 which were purchased later following favorable use of the first two; all were retired in 2009. The improved AW109E and SP – Grand New versions have also been operated by No. 32 Squadron of the Royal Air Force to transport members of the British Royal Family.|$|E

25|$|Brown did {{not plan}} to have a sudden raid and escape to the mountains. Rather, he {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> rifles and pikes he captured at the arsenal, {{in addition to those}} he brought along, to arm rebellious slaves with the aim of striking terror in the slaveholders in Virginia. He believed that on the first night of action, 200-500 black slaves would join his line. He ridiculed the militia and regular army that might oppose him. He planned to send agents to nearby plantations, rallying the slaves. He planned to hold Harpers Ferry for a short time, expecting that as many volunteers, white and black, would join him as would form against him. He would move rapidly southward, sending out armed bands along the way. They would free more slaves, obtain food, horses and hostages, and destroy slaveholders' morale. Brown planned to follow the Appalachian Mountains south into Tennessee and even Alabama, the heart of the South, making forays into the plains on either side.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December 2013, Mexican {{authorities}} {{confirmed in}} a press conference that the corpse of Inzunza Inzunza was stolen by alleged gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel during the shootout. Investigators, however, identified the drug lord due to the DNA tests conducted at the crime scene. Authorities were also able to intercept the phone call lines of the criminals involved in the shootout and confirm that the drug lord was killed. The Peñasco city spokesman confirmed {{a couple of days later}} that the shootout begun precisely inside the Bella Sirena complex, a beachfront villa where Inzunza Inzunza was possibly staying for the holidays. He insisted that neither the drug lord nor any of his men involved in the shootout lived in Peñasco. Mexican authorities also provided more details of the shootout in the days following the gunfight; they confirmed that two Black Hawk helicopters were used in the operation, and that there were at least 10 vehicles of the alleged gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel present during the fire exchange. The police confirmed that they found 14 high-calibre assault rifles at the scene. They also confirmed that five criminals were killed in the shootout (not six, as stated by other sources) and two officers were wounded. The authorities also confirmed that they had an undercover federal agent staying at the complex where Inzunza Inzunza was hiding for about 15 days prior to the shooting. By spying on him throughout the day and passing that information to his counterparts, authorities were able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> intelligence reports to hunt down the drug lord.|$|E

500|$|Operation PBHistory was {{a covert}} {{operation}} in Guatemala by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It followed Operation PBSuccess, {{which led to}} the overthrow of Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in June 1954 and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. PBHistory attempted to use documents left behind by Árbenz's government and by organizations related to the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour to demonstrate that the Guatemalan government had been {{under the influence of the}} Soviet Union, and <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>those</b> documents to obtain further intelligence that would be useful to US intelligence agencies. It was an effort to justify the overthrow of the elected Guatemalan government in response to the negative international reactions to PBSUCCESS. The CIA also hoped to improve its intelligence resources about communist parties in Latin America, a subject on which it had little information.|$|E
