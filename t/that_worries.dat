60|$|But Neale {{did not see}} any {{humor in}} Slingerland's perplexity or in the cowboy's facetiousness. It was the girl's serious {{condition}} <b>that</b> <b>worried</b> him, not her future comfort.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{the case}} of Kirk <b>that</b> <b>worried</b> him most, for he half guessed that the latter's gloom had to do with Ruth; and he worshipped Ruth.|$|R

50|$|Overall, {{these studies}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> and {{rumination}} are related constructs that both lead to depression and anxiety. It is likely <b>that</b> rumination and <b>worry,</b> as with rumination and reflection, are related types of repetitive thinking {{that may be}} better captured as subtypes of some larger construct, such as avoidant coping strategies.|$|R
40|$|Both lay {{concept and}} {{scientific}} theory {{have embraced the}} view <b>that</b> nonpathological <b>worry</b> may be helpful for defining and analyzing problems. To evaluate the quality of problem elaborations, concreteness is a key variable. Two studies with nonclinical student samples are presented in which participants elaborated topics associated with different degrees of worry. In Study 1, participants' elaborations were assessed using problem elaboration charts; in Study 2, they were assessed using catastrophizing interviews. When participants' problem elaborations were rated for concreteness, both studies showed an inverse relationship between degree of worry and concreteness: The more participants worried about a given topic the less concrete was {{the content of their}} elaboration. The results challenge the view <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> may promote better problem analyses. Instead they conform to the view <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> is a cognitive avoidance response...|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} <b>that</b> <b>worries</b> me is what {{happened}} this morning. I {{want to know how}} you feel about it. If it's on your nerves in the least we can have the old farm {{at the back of the}} house pulled down, or perhaps it has spoiled the notion for you?" ...|$|E

"There's nothing <b>that</b> <b>worries</b> {{me so much}} as your shilly-shallying, Luke, or {{the thought}} that you are making futile {{endeavours}} to keep something from me," [...] she retorted almost irritably this time, for, strangely enough, her nerves--she never knew before this that she had any--were slightly on the jar this morning.|$|E

There will be some {{satisfaction}} in placing such a rascal behind the bars, but that won't give Mr. Sanderson his cash back nor lift that mortgage." ...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{features}} <b>that</b> differentiate <b>worry</b> from {{somatic anxiety}} and depression. Theoretical {{models of the}} <b>worry</b> process suggest <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> {{is closely related to}} procrastination. In addition, research on worry and elevated evidence requirements proposes a relationship between worry and perfectionism. Perfectionism, however, is multidimensional in nature. Moreover, previous research has linked procrastination and perfectionism mainly to anxiety and depression. Therefore, the relationship among worry, procrastination, and dimensions of perfectionism was investigated irt a sample of 180 students, controlling for anxiety and depression. Results show <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> had substantial correlations with procrastination and perfectionism, particularly with perfectionist concern over mistakes and doubts. Moreover, worry was related to parental criticism and expectations, but unrelated to excessively high personal standards. instead high-worriers reported to lower standards under stress. Partial correlations indicated that these correlations were specific for amount of worry, thus differentiating amount of worry, pathological worry, anxiety, and depression...|$|R
