5|$|Several {{variants}} on the Hamilcar Mark I were planned, {{although only}} one was actually produced. The Hamilcar Mark X, {{also known as}} the GAL. 58, was designed to specification X 4/44 in an attempt to allow Hamilcars {{to be used in the}} tropical climate of the Pacific, where high temperatures and the high altitudes of many airfields reduced the efficiency of piston-engined aircraft. This meant that Halifax bombers could not tow Hamilcars without a drastically reduced fuel load, which in turn narrowed the range of the Hamilcar. Two initial solutions were proposed to correct this problem; the first was to convert a Hamilcar into a rocket-assisted take off (RATO) aircraft. Two cylindrical steel cylinders filled with twenty-four three-inch rockets were attached to either side of the glider to provide it with 20,000lbs of mean thrust as it took off; they would then be jettisoned once the glider was airborne. Initial trials conducted in January 1943 proved to be successful, but was not pursued any further for unknown reasons. The second solution was double towing, where two Halifax aircraft, one stripped of all unnecessary equipment, attached tow ropes to a Hamilcar and then took off from an airfield; once airborne the normal Halifax would then detach its <b>towrope</b> and land, and the modified Halifax would tow the glider to its destination. However, this idea went no further than initial trials in England, as it was considered to be a high risk operation with a high probability of a serious accident occurring. As such, a powered version of the Hamilcar, the Mark X, was decided upon, as it offered the possibility of long-range airborne operations and the ability to retrieve the glider once it had been used. The decision was taken to start developing the Mark X in November 1943 when the potential for airborne operations against Japan itself began to be considered by the Allies; however, for some reason a relaxed view was taken to the development of the production models, and the first was not available until the early months of 1945.|$|E
500|$|While {{this was}} going on, the United States was {{negotiating}} with Great Britain over compensation for losses inflicted by British ships knowingly sold to the Confederacy during the Civil War (the Alabama Claims). Peru {{had been involved in}} an undeclared war with Spain (the Chincha Islands War) in 1864–66 and the US was not willing to prejudice its claims against the United Kingdom by performing a similar action for a belligerent power. Negotiations over the issue delayed the departure of the two monitors until January 1869, after Peru bought two steamers, Reyes and Marañon to tow the monitors. They only reached Pensacola, Florida, before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed. En route from Key West to the Bahamas, the ships were separated in heavy weather. When Reyes attempted to reattach her <b>towrope</b> after the storm moderated, she collided with the sharp bow of Manco Cápac and sank in 15 minutes. The monitor, short of coal and food, was forced to make port at Naranjo, Cuba, then held by rebels against the Spanish government. They allowed the ship to restock her supplies, but no coal was available so the crew loaded up enough wood to reach the Bahamas where they were able to send a local schooner to Nassau to inform the authorities of their plight. The ships finally reunited at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and had to wait for the Pachitea to arrive from Peru to tow Manco Cápac. While entering Rio de Janeiro on the night of 15 September, Manco Cápac ran aground; she was refloated the following day, but the damage required three months to repair. The ships were joined by the steam corvette [...] during this time. They reached the Strait of Magellan on 29 January 1870 and Callao on 11 May.|$|E

60|$|The combat {{was a short}} one. The seventy men {{on board}} fought bravely, {{for a minute or}} two, but they were speedily driven below. The hatches were closed over them, and the cables being already cut, the mizzen topsail, the only sail bent, was hoisted; and the boats, taking <b>towropes,</b> began to row her away from shore.|$|R
2500|$|When the [...] "cut of junction" [...] was formed, a short {{section of}} new canal linking the Monkland Canal to the Forth and Clyde branch canal, it was routed north from the basin under Garngad Hill (now Royston Hill). The route then turned west under Castle Street. The grooves {{worn by the}} barge <b>towropes</b> {{can be seen on}} the iron facing to Castle Street bridge {{abutment}} at this point.|$|R
50|$|The Regent's Canal {{runs through}} {{the north end of}} Camden Town. Canal boat trips along the canal from Camden Lock are popular, {{particularly}} in summer. Many of the handrails by the bridges show deep marks worn by the <b>towropes</b> by which horses pulled canal barges until the 1950s, and it is still possible to see ramps on the canal bank designed to assist horses which fell in the canal after being startled by the noise of a train. Camden Lock is a regularly used traditional manually operated double canal lock operating between widely separated levels. A large complex of weekend street markets operate around the Lock. The towpath is a pedestrian and cycle route which runs continuously from Little Venice through Camden Lock to the Islington TunnelA regular waterbus service operates along the Regent's Canal from Camden Lock. Boats depart every hour during the summer months, heading westwards around Regent's Park, calling at London Zoo and on towards Maida Vale. Sightseeing narrow-boat trips run from Camden Lock to Little Venice.|$|R
2500|$|Following this departure, the Japanese {{committed}} what {{is considered}} their worst war crime on Nauru: the massacre of 39lepers, {{who lived in a}} colony built by the Australians in Meneng. Before the arrival of the Japanese, the lepers had been able to receive visits from their families, and in certain instances, have their children live with them. The occupiers, fearful of contagion, isolated them completely as soon as they landed, and included their families in the first boat to Truk. On 11 July 1943, the [...] — having been told they were to be transferred to a colony on Ponape — were placed aboard a fishing boat, which was then towed out to sea by the Japanese picket-boat Shinshu Maru. Once the boats were out of sight of Nauru the <b>towrope</b> was cut and sailors aboard the Shinshu Maru began firing on the fishing boat with the ship's 50mm cannon and 7.7mm machine gun. The Nauruans were finished off with rifle fire, and the boat capsized and sank. Lt. Nakayama, the de facto commander who had ordered the massacre, would later tell the new garrison commander, Captain Soeda, that the lepers and their boat had been lost in a typhoon while being taken to Jaluit atoll.|$|E
60|$|It {{was barely}} {{an hour after}} sunrise. The doctor waved his big arm {{to me from the}} shore and walked back at once to his trap, which had {{followed}} him empty to the river-side. Mr. Burns, carried across the quarter-deck, had the appearance of being absolutely lifeless. Ransome went down to settle him in his cabin. I had to remain on deck to look after the ship, for the tug had got hold of our <b>towrope</b> already.|$|E
60|$|Don Erminio jumped for {{the ladder}} and a few moments {{afterwards}} Kit got on deck. All was dark and showers of spray blew about, but he saw the schooner was now lying-to, and the crew had partly lowered the big mainsail. The indistinct figures {{hanging on to the}} long boom were trying down a reef. Presently they rehoisted the sail and when the schooner started, foam boiled about her lee bulwarks and all forward was lost in a cloud of spray. Kit looked aft and saw Campeador's boat, lifted half her length out of water, {{at the end of the}} <b>towrope.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{backwater}} {{is called}} Wallabout Bay on charts; {{the men on}} the dredges call it Potter's Field. The eddy sweeps driftwood into the backwater. Also, it sweeps drownded bodies into there. As a rule, people that drown in the harbor in winter stay down until spring. When the water begins to get warm, gas forms in them and that makes them buoyant and they rise to the surface. Every year, without fail, on or about the fifteenth of April, bodies start showing up, and more of them show up in Potter's Field than any other place. In a couple of weeks or so, the Harbor Police always finds ten to two dozen over there - suicides, bastard babies, old barge captains that lost their balance out on a sleety night attending to <b>towropes,</b> now and then some gangster or other. The police launch that runs out of Pier A on the Battery - Launch One - goes over and takes them out of the water with a kind of dip-net contraption that the Police Department blacksmith made out of tire chains.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} dressed they started, made their way down to the bank of the river above the town, and walked along the broad {{causeway}} by the stream until within a mile or two of their destination. Then they turned off toward a clump of trees which were visible by the first gleam of dawn {{a quarter of a mile}} away. Here they slept for some hours, and late in the afternoon returned to the side of the river and strolled quietly along, watching the boats. Those in the middle of the stream were making their way down with the current lightly and easily, the crews often singing merrily, rejoicing over the approaching meeting with their friends after an absence of many weeks. The boats going up the stream were all close to the bank, the crews walking along the causeway and laboring at the <b>towropes,</b> for there was not enough wind to render the sails of any utility in breasting the stream. The craft were of various kinds, some shapeless and rudely fashioned, used in conveying corn from the country higher up down to Thebes, and now returning empty. Others were the fancifully painted boats of the wealthy, with comfortable cabins and sails of many colors richly decorated and embroidered. These were carrying their owners up or down the river, between their country mansions and the city.|$|R

50|$|Water skiing {{was invented}} in 1922 when Ralph Samuelson used a pair of boards as skis and a clothesline as a <b>towrope</b> on Lake Pepin in Lake City, Minnesota. Samuelson experimented with {{different}} positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking {{out of the water}} at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of 20 mph. Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States.|$|E

50|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of the battle that Redmill and the old Polyphemus won their spurs, having suffered just six casualties in the battle and very little in the way of structural damage, Polyphemus needed no repairs and could parcel out her supplies to other ships in more desperate need, as well as offer a tow to dismasted ships which could no longer sail unaided. The British flagship Victory was just such a victim, and during the week of ferocious storms which followed the battle, Redmill nursed his stricken superior back to Gibraltar by means of an enormous <b>towrope</b> attached with great difficulty to the bow of Victory and at the other end to Redmill's own cabin on Polyphemus.|$|E
50|$|G-11s, {{along with}} the Antonov A-7 {{constituted}} a majority of Soviet transport gliders. They were mainly used from mid-1942 for supplying Soviet partisans with provisions, weapons, equipment and trained men, towed mainly by SB or DB-3 bombers. Most intensive use was from March to November 1943 in Belarus, in the Polotsk-Begoml-Lepel area, on the Kalinin Front. Several hundred Soviet gliders (of all types) were used in night supply flights there. After landing, the gliders were destroyed and pilots were sometimes returned by aircraft. The only known instance of a glider returning from the field occurred in April 1943, when a famous glider and test pilot Sergei Anokhin evacuated two wounded partisan commanders in a G-11, towed by a Tupolev SB bomber, piloted by Yuriy Zhelutov, on a 10 m short <b>towrope.</b>|$|E

40|$|A dynamic {{nonlinear}} {{model of}} a ship towed by a nonlinear elastic rope {{in the presence of}} sea current, wind and waves is formulated. Then, a nonlinear rudder controller is proposed for the towed vessel in order to limit its lateral motion in a narrow strip. The efficiency of the proposed controller is investigated through extensive simulations of three types of vessels, viz. a barge, a mariner and a tanker. The results obtained confirm that rudder control can be a great advantage in the sway and yaw motion of the towed vessel and on the tension of the elastic <b>towrope</b> under various adverse weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the real}} voyaging speed for ocean‐going vessels in the actual weather condition {{is important for the}} expanding shipping industry. Ship owners are always aiming at achieving the highest profit, so delivering the goods to the destination within the designed schedule time is of great concern. At the same time, the increasing attention on environmental issues as well as increasing fuel price have put more pressure on optimizing the ship design with respect to energy efficiency. Also, accurate {{prediction of}} the real attainable speed will greatly improve the sea margin prediction. From these respects, the research work on speed loss study is important and necessary. Speed loss is usually categorized as voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary speed loss is when the ship master actively reduces the ship speed to avoid slamming, propeller racing, excessive ship motion or other effects that might cause danger or severe discomfort. Voluntary speed loss is subjective and relies on ship master's experience. Different ship masters can have quite different actions to the same circumstance based on their ability to estimate the potential danger. Involuntary speed loss is due to added resistance from waves, wind, current and reduced thrust and efficiency due to waves and other changes in operational conditions. Involuntary speed loss is in focus in this thesis work. In order to investigate the nature of speed reduction in the real environment, integrated knowledge about resistance, propulsion, ship machinery, seakeeping, automatic control and maneuvering are required. This thesis takes advantage of model tests and a numerical simulation tool based on simplified modular concept to investigate the nature of speed reduction in seakeeping and maneuvering conditions. A series of experiments were carried out on a model of 8000 DWT tanker in the large towing tank and ocean basin at Marine Technology Center in Trondheim, Norway. The model was selfpropelled and mainly running in moderate long wave conditions. For speed loss in head sea conditions, three different bow shapes were tested in order to investigate the influence of added wave resistance. Due to the practical difficulty of applying <b>towrope</b> force to balance the frictional resistance coefficient difference between model scale and full scale ship, a method is proposed in this thesis to make compensation for the frictional resistance difference and predict speed loss of the ships when propeller is working at 'ship propulsion point'. Test results show that a conventional bow with bulb and flare gave least calm water resistance, while a bow without bulb and flare gave the least total resistance in the tested wave conditions. That means bulb can have positive influence on calm water resistance and negative effect on added wave resistance. Reduction of speed loss in waves up to order of 10 % can be gained by relatively minor changes to the bow shape of a vessel. Another two tests for speed loss in zigzag maneuvering in head waves and speed loss in oblique waves were carried out in the towing tank and ocean basin respectively. Speed loss when doing zigzag maneuvering in waves is due to yawing, added wave resistance and loss of thrust due to steering; while for speed loss in oblique waves is due to added wave resistance and loss of thrust due to steering. For the test of speed loss in oblique waves, <b>towrope</b> force is added by an air fan. Due to limitation of basin length, converged speed is not always achieved during the tests due to the large mass of the model. A converged speed prediction method is proposed which can be used to correct the nonconverged tests results. This method is carefully verified and can give good prediction of attainable speed in waves. However, this method is sensitive to the selection of thrust deduction factor in waves. Also how much speed loss due to added wave resistance and due to steering is pointed out. Speed loss due to added wave resistance and steering is of the same magnitude in head sea and bow sea conditions. While for beam sea, speed loss due to steering is dominating. Numerical simulation work was carried out in order to make comparisons with experimental results. Comparable calculations were performed in the frequency domain tool ShipX and in the time‐domain tool Vessel Simulator. Ship motion is calculated by linear strip theory and added wave resistance in head sea is calculated by the method developed by Gerritsma and Beukelman and the Direct Pressure Integration method. Wave resistance in other than head sea condition in surge, sway and yaw directions is calculated by the method proposed by Loukakis and Sclavounos, which is an extension of the Gerritsma and Beukelman method to other than head sea. For the speed loss in head sea condition, both frequency domain calculations using ShipX and time domain calculations using Vessel Simulator were carried out. It is concluded that both methods can give a good prediction of speed loss in moderate sea conditions. For the cases that steering effect has to be taken into account, time domain simulation is a preferable method. Generally speaking, numerical results can give a good correlation with model test data. Based on the good validation of the numerical tool, further numerical investigations were carried out to compare the speed loss characteristics between conventional propeller‐rudder system and azimuth thrusters. The results showed that conventional propeller‐rudder system has better speed keeping ability than azimuth thrusters. That is because in the conventional propeller‐rudder system propeller force is not decomposed by the rudder angle and also conventional propeller‐rudder system has higher ratio of longitudinal thrust force/transverse thrust force than azimuth thrusters within the working steering angle range. In the end, recommendations to ITTC procedures to predict speed loss and power increase in irregular waves and sea margin were proposed. A method to predict 'ship propulsion point' from the self‐propulsion test carried out at 'model propulsion point' is specified in this thesis. This method will greatly improve the procedures to predict power increase in irregular waves from model tests in regular waves. Also another suggestion is proposed that when evaluating power increase in irregular waves and sea margin prediction, thrust deduction due to ventilation and steering effect should be taken into account in addition to thrust diminution factor.
