40|$|ABSTRACT. Fogger {{application}} of pesticide in greenhouses can reduce application time and applicator contact with equipment. Since fog applications use {{smaller and more}} concentrated droplets than typical wet spray applications, potential for inhalation and off-target <b>transport</b> <b>hazards</b> may be increased. This study investigated temporal characteristics of airborne pesticide after thermal fogging of a greenhouse. Droplet size spectra and concentration of airborne pesticide were measured. Volume median diameter of the suspended aerosol decreased from 14 to 2. 3 µm during 1. 5 h after application. Concentration of airborne pesticide decreased by 60 % in the first hour after application and by 95 % during 12 h after application. Implications for respiratory exposure were analytically developed from observed data. Hand spraying with high-pressure, high-volume systems {{is the most common}} technique of pesticide application in greenhouse culture. However, fog or aerosol applications are feasible and often-used alternatives for enclosed structures. The motivations for fog application are the potential to increase spray deposition; improve pest control efficacy; and reduce application times, rates of active ingredients, and applicator exposure. A common fogging procedure in greenhouse operations is to apply the fog in late afternoon or early evening. This practice allow...|$|R

40|$|The {{licensing}} requirements of 10 CFR 71 (US Code of Federal Regulations) {{are the primary}} criteria used to license proposed US Department of Energy (DOE) shipments of nuclear components. However, if a shipment cannot meet 10 CFR 71 requirements, a Transportation System Risk Assessment (TSRA) is prepared to document: (1) the degree of compliance of proposed DOE shipments of nuclear components with applicable federal regulations, and (2) the risk associated with the proposed shipments. The Nuclear Explosive Safety Division (NESD) of the Department of Energy, Albuquerque Area Office (DOE-AL) is responsible for evaluating TSRAs and for preparing Safety Evaluation Reports (SERs) to authorize the off-site <b>transport.</b> <b>Hazards</b> associated with the transport may include the presence of fissile material, chemically and radiologically toxic uranium, and ionizing radiation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has historically considered only radiological hazards in licensing the transport of radiological material because the US Department of Transportation considers {{licensing requirements}} of nonradiological (i. e., chemically toxic) hazards. The requirements of 10 CFR 71 are based primarily on consideration of radiological hazards. For completeness, this report provides information for assessing the effects of chemical toxicity. Evaluating the degree of compliance {{with the requirements of}} 10 CFR 71 is relatively straightforward. However, there are few precedents associated with developing TSRA risk assessments for packages that do not comply with all of the requirements of 10 CFR 71. The objective of the task is to develop Risk Evaluation Guidelines for DOE-AL to use when evaluating a TSRA. If the TSRA shows that the Risk Evaluation Guidelines are not exceeded, then from a risk perspective the TSRA should be approved if there is evidence that the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle has been applied...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{transfusion}} of {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) is safer than ever regarding infections, it is still associated with several adverse reactions and therefore should only be used {{on the basis of}} evidence-based triggers. However, prevention of RBC transfusion and subsequent substitution of blood losses with acellular solutions will inevitably result in dilutional anemia. Acute dilutional anemia can be compensated by the body over a wide range of hemoglobin concentrations without a critical restriction of tissue oxygenation. On the other hand, chronic anemia is known to be a potent cause of morbidity and mortality. As a consequence, the impact of perioperative anemia on mortality is difficult to describe, because anemia, as well as the transfusion of RBCs, can influence the clinical outcome. The resulting ‘Gordian knot’ cannot be cut easily, and this circumstance forces clinical physicians to make a daily trade-off between transfusion-associated and anemia-associated risks.

40|$|Railroads in North America have {{recently}} come {{under pressure to}} avoid <b>transporting</b> certain high <b>hazard</b> materials through metropolitan areas. There are two principal reasons- fear of terrorist attack and concern {{about the risk of}} an accident-caused release. Consequently, a number of municipalities are considering legislation to block hazardous materials transportation through their communities, thereby requiring the shipments to be rerouted. However, rerouting of hazardous materials is not without its own set of risks. The distance traveled, time in transit, number of visits to classification yards and the number of smaller population centers exposed to the risk would all increase. Furthermore, the track quality may be lower on the alternate routes. All of these factors increase risk but to date, no formal analysis comparing the relative risks for shorter urban routes versus longer more rural routings has been presented. In this paper we describe a comprehensive risk assessment model that enables evaluation of different rail route alternatives for transporting hazardous materials. Major variables considere...|$|R

This study identifies occupational hazards on two construction sites – hazards that {{were related to the}} design of the building – and undertakes an analysis of the basis upon which related design decisions were made. Risks of falling from heights were related to the shape of the building. Risks related to an excessive workload were related to the weight of building products and possibilities to use equipment to avoid manual <b>transports.</b> The <b>hazards</b> were discussed at focus group meetings. During these meetings, the participants showed an increased understanding of safety issues in the project, each other's views and difficulties, and their own ability to facilitate acceptable risk levels for others. Some hazards were not foreseen during the design and planning phase. According to the architects, their knowledge about construction methods was not sufficient to predict hazards related to the shape of the building. Other hazards were foreseen, though considered to be primarily the contractor's responsibility. Consultants in the design and planning phase, on behalf of the client, were focused on quality, time schedule and economy, more than on occupational safety. There were building products on the market which were designed to fulfil functional regulatory requirements and requests from consumers, but not sufficient enough to ensure that they could be handled without exposure to an excessive workload.

The three projects (that ran from 2009 and 2012) are as follows: (1) EWENT (Extreme Weather impacts on European Networks of Transport-www. ewent. vtt. fi); (2) ECCONET (Effects of climate change on the inland waterway networks-www. ecconet. eu); (3) WEATHER (Weather Extremes: Assessment of Impacts on <b>Transport</b> and <b>Hazards</b> for European Regions-www. weather-project. eu).

40|$|The past 15 {{years has}} been {{characterized}} by a high density of record-breaking weather extremes in Europe. These include the extratropical cyclones Lothar, Kyrill and Xynthia across western and mid Europe; the major floods in the UK, Germany and eastern Europe; the heat waves in 2003 and 2007 and, after {{a long period of}} mild winters, the heavy winter seasons in 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011. Inspired by the rising trends in weather-related damages worldwide and the studies on the topic carried out in overseas, the EC funded the sister projects such as Weather Extremes-Assessing the Impacts on <b>Transport</b> and <b>Hazards</b> for European Regions (WEATHER), EWENT and ECCONET to determine the magnitude of current and future risks to the European transport sector and to assess suitable adaptation strategies. This paper presents the assessment framework of the WEATHER project and the results of weather-inflicted damage costs now and in 2040 - 2050. Total annual damages are found to be around 2. 5 billion, which largely attribute to road traffic. However, broken down to passenger and ton kilometers the highest risk is borne by rail traffic due to its expensive infrastructures and its comparably complex operating structure. This indication even amplifies when looking four decades ahead: while average road transport costs will only raise by 7 % due to milder winters, rail traffic costs may increase by up to 80 % due to more floods and less predictable winter periods. A comparison with the results of the EWENT study uncovers a high range of uncertainty concerning methodological approaches and data treatment. Thus, the final figures might even be much higher...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Geo-resources play an {{increasing}} {{significant role in}} achieving a sustainable energy future. However, their exploitation is not free of environmental impacts. This paper aims to identify the lessons and knowledge gaps on understanding of the sources, mechanisms and scope of environmental consequences of underground geo-energy resources exploitation. The paper examines four underground exploitation activities: CO 2 geological storage, exploitation of shale gas, geothermal power and {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES). Selected studies carrying out life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental risk assessment (ERA) are structurally reviewed by applying a six steps method. Our finding indicates that global warming potential is the major focus of examined LCA studies with relatively less attention on other impacts. Environmental impacts at the local level are less evaluated except water use for shale gas and geothermal power. Environmental impacts of exploitation with storage purposes are relatively low. For energy supply associated exploitation, the impacts largely depend on the types of underground activities and the exploited energy carriers. In the ERA studies, likelihood of a hazard occurrence is the focus of the probability assessment. There is limited information on the pathways and <b>transport</b> of <b>hazard</b> agents in the subsurface and on the relation between hazard exposure and the impacts. The leakage of the storing agents is the well-identified hazard for storage associated exploitation, while the migration of fluids and exploited energy carriers are the ones for exploitation with energy supply purposes. In general, understanding of environmental risks of soil contamination are limited. Very few number of ERA studies are available for assessing a CAES. Our research points out the need for developing a framework which allows the integration between LCA and ERA in subsurface environmental management...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{blood brain barrier}} (BBB) is {{impermeable}} to most drugs, impeding {{the establishment}} of novel neuroprotective therapies and strategies for many neurological diseases. Intranasal administration offers an alternative path for efficient drug delivery into the CNS. So far, the anatomical structures discussed {{to be involved in}} the transport of intranasally administered drugs into the CNS include the trigeminal nerve, olfactory nerve and the rostral migratory stream (RMS), but the relative contributions are debated. Methods and Findings: In the present study we demonstrate that surgical transection, and the resulting structural disruption of the RMS, in mice effectively obstructs the uptake of intranasally administered radioligands into the CNS. Furthermore, using a fluorescent cell tracer, we demonstrate that intranasal administration in mice allows agents to be distributed throughout the entire brain, including olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the vital role the RMS has in the CNS delivery of intranasally administered agents. The identification of the RMS as the major access path for intranasally administered drugs into the CNS may contribute to the development of treatments that are tailored for efficient transport within this structure. Research into the RMS needs to continue to elucidate its limitations, capabilities, mechanisms of <b>transport</b> and potential <b>hazards</b> before w...|$|R
40|$|What differentiates the {{transport}} of dangerous substances and preparations from other types of goods transport is, of course, the risk associated with its eventual release during transport, since they can be extremely harmful {{to the environment and}} human health. The release of these materials during <b>transport</b> is a <b>hazard,</b> ie a process capable of producing identifiable damages (Julian, RP et al, 2009). Among existing models for hazmat transport risk assessment we focus on two of the most widely used, from ERKUT and VERTER (1995, 1998). According to these, the largest obstacle to developing more accurate models, particularly for the determination of the potentially affected areas (APA), are the limitations of available data on meteorological conditions, topography, the effect of the substance transported in people and locating of these people {{at the time of the}} incident. This limitation leads to the use of fixed limits specified by the Emergency Response Guidebook. On this purpose, there is free software very easy to use, for the determination of APAs, as ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres), produced by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. We test this software and show that important differences occur as parameters on the type and quantity of hazmat, the characteristics of the area for the type of occupancy, weather conditions and topography are included or not...|$|R
40|$|Explosive {{activity}} and lava dome collapse at stratovolcanoes {{can lead to}} pyroclastic density currents (PDCs; mixtures of volcanic gas, air, and volcanic particles) that produce complex deposits and pose a hazard to surrounding populations. Two-dimensional computer simulations of dilute PDCs (characterized by a turbulent suspended load and deposition through a bed load) show that PDC <b>transport,</b> deposition, and <b>hazard</b> potential {{are sensitive to the}} shape of the volcano slope (profile) down which they flow. We focus on three generic volcano profiles: straight, concave-upward, and convex-upward. Dilute PDCs that flow down a constant slope gradually decelerate over the simulated run-out distance (5 km in the horizontal direction) due to a combination of sedimentation, which reduces the density of the PDC, and mixing with the atmosphere. However, dilute PDCs down a concave-upward slope accelerate high on the volcano flanks and have less sedimentation until they begin to decelerate over the shallow lower slopes. A convex-upward slope causes dilute PDCs to lose relatively more of their pyroclast load on the upper slopes of a volcano, and although they accelerate as they reach the lower, steeper slopes, the acceleration is reduced because of the upstream loss of pyroclasts (lower density contrast with the atmosphere). Dynamic pressure, a measure of the damage that can be caused by PDCs, reflects these complex relations...|$|R
40|$|Dasymetric {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used to redistribute or disaggregate (census) population data, using either simple binary or multi-layer models. Most models show limitations in high density built-up areas as they commonly ignore the 3 D dimension (meaning buildings height) of multi-story urban environments. For example, simple dasymetric models only allocate the population counts to built-up areas, without considering differences between areas of multi-story and single-story buildings. Furthermore, such models only allow the disaggregation of ‘night-time’ population data, while for many urban applications such as <b>transport,</b> health or <b>hazard,</b> the location of ‘day-time’ population is of interest. This research presents an initial approach to model day and night-time population using as case study an Indian city (Kalyan-Dombivli). For most Indian cities, census population data is only available for wards, while day-time population data is either not available or of very poor quality. Besides census data and ancillary spatial data, this research uses a 3 D urban model, extracted from Cartosat stereo-images. First, the extracted height from the stereo-image is used in combination with building footprints to disaggregate census population data at wards to ‘night-time’ population per building. Second, a classification of economically active areas is constructed based on the 3 D urban model {{in combination with other}} spatial layers (e. g. transport layers) to model the day-time population. The result shows different concentration of population during day and night-time across ward boundaries as well as it confirms the potential of 3 D data to disaggregate population data...|$|R

The focus of this paper is on the natural disasters, which are rampant within the lake Victoria basin and are related to extreme weather and climate events such as droughts, floods and strong winds, among others. Extreme weather and climate events influence the welfare of the society and entire economy of the country with droughts and floods having the highest adverse effects. The sectors that experience the immediate effects include agriculture, health, and water resources among others. Droughts and floods contribute to the most devastating natural hazards in the basin, which often translate into disasters in the riparian countries. Droughts affect food production, availability of water, and generation hydroelectric power for industrial and domestic consumption. The majority of short falls in food supply recorded in 1928, 1933 - 34, 1937, 1939, 1942 - 44, 1947, 1951, 1952 - 55, 1957. 58 m 1984 / 85 and 1999 - 2000 could be easily associated with rainfall deficits experienced in the respective years.

Historically characterised by high flood hazards, the Bisagno Valleywas recently affected by a flood event on 9 October 2014, {{less than three years}} after the tragic flood event of 4 November 2011 when six people died, including two children. In the last 50 years, four destructive floods occurred in the Bisagno Valley, in addition to some other events that caused significant damage and economic losses. This paper examines the three largest flood events in terms of intensity and ground effects which affected the Bisagno Valley in the last three centuries: the flood of 25 October 1822,well documented by contemporary sources, the flood of 8 October 1970, undoubtedly the most tragic on record, and the very recent event of 9 October 2014. For this purpose scientific and historical-geographicalmethodologies were adopted, the latter particularly useful for the reconstruction of the flood event of 1822 and the landscape history of the Bisagno Valley in the nineteenth century. This comparison shows that the Bisagno Valley is characterised by climatic and landform features that have been making the flood events historically common in the area. However, recent climate change and land-use variations, including some major modifications of the catchment basin, have progressively determined a decrease of the concentration time and an increase of runoff, solid <b>transport,</b> and flood <b>hazard.</b> Consequently, in recent decades a {{growth in the number of}} flood events occurred, to the extent that the Bisagno today is a famous case study on an international scale...|$|R
40|$|Tephra {{deposits}} {{are one of}} {{the possible}} outcomes of explosive volcanic eruptions and are the result of vertical settling of volcanic particles that have been expelled from the volcanic vent into the atmosphere, following magma fragmentation within the volcanic conduit. Tephra fallout represents the main volcanic hazard to populated areas and critical facilities. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand processes that lead to tephra <b>transport,</b> sedimentation and <b>hazards.</b> In this study, and based on detailed mapping and sampling of the tephra deposit of the 2450 BP Plinian eruption of Pululagua volcano (Ecuador), I investigate tephra deposits through a variety of approaches, including empirical and analytical modeling of tephra thickness and grain size data to infer important eruption source parameters (e. g. column height, total mass ejected, total grain size distribution of the deposit). I also use a statistical approach (smoothed bootstrap with replacement method) to assess the uncertainty in the eruptive parameters. The 2450 BP Pululagua volcanic plume dynamics were also explored through detailed grain size analysis and 1 D modeling of tephra accumulation. Finally, I investigate the influence of particle shape on tephra accumulation on the ground through a quantitative and comprehensive study of the shape of volcanic ash. As the global need for energy is expected to grow in the future, many future natural hazard studies will likely involve the assessment of volcanic hazards at critical facilities, including nuclear power plants. I address the potential hazards from tephra fallout, pyroclastic flows and lahars for the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (Philippines) posed by three nearby volcanoes capable of impacting the site during an explosive eruption. I stress the need for good constraints (stratigraphic analysis and events dating) on past eruptive events to better quantify the probability of future events at potentially active volcanoes, the need for probabilistic approaches in such volcanic hazard assessments to address a broad range of potential eruption scenarios, and the importance of considering coupled volcanic processes (e. g. tephra fallout leading to lahars) in volcanic hazard assessments...|$|R

A three-dimensional (3 -D) Mineralogic Model was developed for Yucca Mountain to support the analyses of hydrologic properties, radionuclide <b>transport,</b> mineral health <b>hazards,</b> repository performance, and repository design. Version 3. 0 of the MM was developed from mineralogic data obtained from borehole samples. It consists of matrix mineral abundances {{as a function of}} x (easting), y (northing), and z (elevation), referenced to the stratigraphic framework defined in Version 3. 1 of the Geologic Framework Model (GFM). The MM was developed specifically for incorporation into the 3 -D Integrated Site Model (ISM). The MM enables project personnel to obtain calculated mineral abundances at any position, within any region, or within any stratigraphic unit in the model area. The significance of the MM for key aspects of site characterization and performance assessment is explained in the following subsections. This work was conducted in accordance with the Development Plan for the MM (CRWMS M&O 2000). The planning document for this Rev. 00, ICN 02 of this AMR is Technical Work Plan, TWP-NBS-GS- 000003, Technical Work Plan for the Integrated Site Model, Process Model Report, Revision 01 (CRWMS M&O 2000). The {{purpose of this}} ICN is to record changes in the classification of input status by the resolution of the use of TBV software and data in this report. Constraints and limitations of the MM are discussed in the appropriate sections that follow. The MM is one component of the ISM, which has been developed to provide a consistent volumetric portrayal of the rock layers, rock properties, and mineralogy of the Yucca Mountain site. The ISM consists of three components: (1) Geologic Framework Model (GFM); (2) Rock Properties Model (RPM); and (3) Mineralogic Model (MM). The ISM merges the detailed stratigraphy and structural features of the site into a 3 -D model that will be useful in primary downstream models and repository design. These downstream models include the hydrologic flow models and the radionuclide transport models. All the models and the repository design, in turn, will be incorporated into the Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) of the potential nuclear waste repository block and vicinity to determine the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a host for a repository. The interrelationship of the three components of the ISM and their interface with downstream uses are illustrated in Figure 1.
