Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E

A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view {{that the image of}} his crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the credibility of the Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E

5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any value recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as high as locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on <b>the</b> <b>tolerance</b> of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E

In this paper, a comprehensive model of industrial robot manipulator capable of carrying out various applications is developed and computer simulated.
