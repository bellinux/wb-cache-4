5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, <b>trouble</b> <b>sleeping,</b> and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E

30|$|In the life-story {{interviews}} {{the women}} clearly narrate {{the relation between}} health and employment as mutually reinforcing. The structural analysis shows how women structure their life narratives in several chapters, either characterized by a positive or a negative reinforcing relation between health and employment. Inge, a 34 -year old Dutch woman, {{provides an example of}} the positive reinforcing relation between health and employment; “When the municipality gave me a house, everything became better, more stable. The headaches disappeared. And uhh, so I could focus on finding a job, and eventually succeeded. Now even my backache is gone. I always thought that I couldn’t work because of the pain in my back, but actually working helped solve my back problems haha!”. We name this type of narrating of a positive reinforcing relationship between health, employment and other factors a ‘virtuous cycle’. Fatima, a 43 -year old Moroccan marriage migrant, on the other hand, provides an example of a negative reinforcing relation: “After the accident I had pain in my left arm, every day. The doctor could not help. I had to quit my job, I simply couldn’t do that cleaning work with that arm. And then, oh, everything got worse. I had no money, I worried. Also <b>troubles</b> <b>sleeping,</b> worrying, I even go to psychologist”. We have named this negative reinforcing relation among health, employment and other factors a ‘vicious cycle’. A succession of reciprocal cause and effect in which several aspects of life intensify and aggravate each other, leading unavoidably to a deterioration of the situation. The life stories of the women we talked to contained both vicious and virtuous cycles at different stages in their lives.|$|R

Methods: The COPSOQ-K was developed through forward-backward translation techniques, and revision based on feed-back from focus groups. Survey {{data were collected from}} 311 office workers who worked in one workplace. An internal consistency reliability was estimated by Cronbach's ⍺. The impacts of the COPSOQ-K scales on job satisfaction, self-rated health, stress, <b>sleeping</b> <b>troubles,</b> burnout, and sickness absence were analyzed with multiple regression model or multiple logistic regression model, adjusted age and gender using SAS version 9. 3. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the COPSOQ-K scales and Korean job stress and its subdomain were identified. Results: Cronbach's ⍺ of COPSOQ-K scales was adequate or good (0. 66 ~ 0. 87). The major COPSOQ-K scales predict job satisfaction, self-rated health, stress, <b>sleeping</b> <b>troubles</b> burnout, and sickness absence.

Lack of medical psychological support resources also puts victims of war rape at further disadvantage. Refugee women are also at a disadvantage of receiving adequate assistance to deal with the psychological consequences of war rape - not only do they lack legal representation, they also may lack protection from the perpetrators of the violent act. Furthermore, there is an increase in dislike of refugees and asylum seekers which is another obstacle in the psychological healing process of victims seeking assistance outside of their countries that may still be under civil strife. Psychological support and counseling sessions given by individuals not part of the ethnic, linguistic, and/or community may incite difficulties in communication between patient and care giver. As a result, adequate emotional and psychological support to the victims is not fully developed, affecting the long-term healing potential for the patient.|$|E
40|$|Background: HIV-infected {{patients}} on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may experience symptoms because of HIV disease or treatment. Symptoms might negatively affect quality of life, adherence, virological response, and survival. We investigated {{to what extent}} HIV-infected patients receiving cART experience symptoms with a median follow-up of 5. 1 years. Additionally, we studied whether self-reported symptoms were related to concurrent {{quality of life and}} virological failure. Methods: Patients from the ATHENA cohort completed questionnaires on self-reported symptoms and quality of life every 6 months (January 1998 to June 2005). Quality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV), resulting in a physical health summary (PHS) score and a mental health summary (MHS) score. Growth curve models were conducted to investigate the course of symptoms. Random effect models were carried out to study the association with concurrent quality of life and virological response. Results: We included 391 patients, completing 2, 851 questionnaires. Symptoms that increased significantly over time were numb feeling in fingers or toes (P <. 01), pain in legs (P <. 01), pain when urinating (P <. 01), sore muscles (P =. 02), tingling of hands or feet (P =. 06), and difficulties with seeing (P <. 01). All self-reported symptoms were related to lower levels of PHS and MHS (P <. 01). <b>Trouble</b> with <b>sleeping</b> (odds ratio [OR] 1. 5; 95 % Cl, 1. 04 - 2. 2), constipation (OR 2. 8; 95 % Cl, 1. 7 - 1. 8), pain in legs (OR 1. 8; 95 % Cl, 1. 2 - 2. 6), and numb feeling in fingers or toes (OR 1. 7; 95 % Cl, 1. 1 - 2. 7) were related to concurrent virological response.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} qualitative research exploring the psycho-social effects of corticosteroid use in pediatric hematology patients during continuation therapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). The findings are from a 5 -year longitudinal study that documented the experience of treatment for childhood leukemia and related disorders {{from the perspective of}} the child patient and their family from the point of diagnosis to 1 year post-treatment. To date, scant information on the serious emotional side-effects of corticosteroid administration for children with ALL during the continuation period is available. This is concerning in light of the many serious challenges corticosteroid use poses to families of children with ALL. For this group of parents, dealing with the impact of corticosteroids on their child was reported as the major and only treatment-related stress during the continuation period of treatment for ALL. The impact of these drugs, described in very negative terms, was considered exacerbated by the fact that during the continuation period they are repeatedly administered in 5 -week cycles. Anger and aggression, both passive and in acts of physical violence, in combination with temper tantrums and uncontrollable behavior were major concerns. Under the influence of corticosteroids the children could be moody, grumpy, confused, emotionally labile, depressed, sullen and withdrawn. The children could quickly switch from one emotional state to another, such as from aggression to emotionality. They could experience <b>trouble</b> with <b>sleeping</b> and talk excessively. The parents outlined a range of positive strategies for coping with the difficult behavior. The authors make a number of recommendations aimed at assisting parents to deal with the impact of the administration of corticosteroids in continuation therapy, including increasing the awareness on the part of health care providers of the side-effects of these drugs and their impact on the child with ALL and their family; provision of information to families on the effects of corticosteroid use; and, ensuring that professional counseling assistance is available when required.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether psychoeducative, trauma-focused group {{intervention}} decreases psychiatric symptoms among boys exposed to sexual abuse. The subjects were seven male adolescents aged between 14 to 17 years. They were sexually abused for six months by two extrafamilial, male perpetrators. The intervention based on an applied version of Teaching Survival Skills Manual by Smith, Yule and Dyregrov was initiated half a year later. The individual interviews and evaluation were conducted both before and after the intervention process. The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were evaluated with The Children's Impact of Event Scale (CRIES- 13), and depressiveness by the Finnish modification of the Beck Depression Inventory (R-BDI). The intervention consisted of nine therapy sessions for the adolescents and three parallel group meetings for the parents including the follow-up sessions. The results showed that PTSD symptoms decreased significantly during the intervention. The decrease was significant in all the symptoms of PTSD (arousal, avoidance and intrusion) being greatest in the symptoms of avoidance. The depression symptoms, such as <b>troubles</b> in <b>sleeping,</b> feelings of self-accusation and irritation, decreased also prominently during the intervention. Behaviour problems and feelings of apprehensiveness lessened as well. According to R-BDI -questionnaire after the group intervention, six adolescents complained no depression symptoms whatsoever, and in one adolescent, the depression symptoms decreased by 40 %. The findings support the conclusion that the psychoeducative trauma-focused group therapy is both promising and well accepted treatment method for sexually abused adolescents. The results of the current study are encouraging and can be applied to benefit professionals in health care to develop further treatment efforts in the challenging area of male sexual abuse. However, the results are preliminary and more research is needed, especially on the question which treatment elements are the most critical for producing optimal outcomes in sexually abused adolescents.
