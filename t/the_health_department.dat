25|$|The New York City guide Preventing Rats on Your Property {{discusses}} how the NYC Health Department, {{through its}} Pest Control Services program, inspects {{private and public}} properties for rats. Property owners that fail an inspection receive a Health Department Commissioner's Order and have five days to correct the problem. If after five days the property fails a second inspection, the owner receives a Notice of Violation and can be fined. If <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Department</b> feels it must itself exterminate or clean up the property, the property owner is billed (about $1,000 a day in 2004). Unpaid charges become a priority lien against the building, preventing property owners from selling with a clean legal title. Failure to comply with an order of the Commissioner is a misdemeanor, and subjects the landlord to criminal prosecution, a fine and/or imprisonment, as well as additional civil penalties. The penalty for each rodent violation was as high as $2,000 in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In February 1912, he {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} at the bacteriology department of the University of Iași medical faculty. The department lacked a physical space and a laboratory, and for nearly thirteen years had been staffed by substitute professors.

In 1913, during the Second Balkan War, he was sent to the front in Bulgaria {{in order to deal with}} a cholera epidemic. Decorated with the Military Virtue Medal in gold, he returned in 1914 and began to set up a bacteriology laboratory. He trained the first assistants and rented and furnished a house. Although the initial 10,000 lei and the additional 3000 lei per year received from the Education Ministry were woefully inadequate, he supplemented these with personal funds, private donations and substantial grants from <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>department</b> of the Interior Ministry, managing to set up a suitable laboratory for a country that had entered World War I by 1916.
