2500|$|In a 2010 interview, Rutan {{articulated}} {{his motivation}} for developing suborbital technology projects with SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo. [...] He was developing suborbital spaceflight technology {{because in this}} [...] "we can achieve some breakthroughs," [...] making such flight [...] "orders of magnitude safer and orders of magnitude more affordable. [...] I'm taking this step because I think achieving something that has never existed in manned spaceflight – and that is high volume and public access – I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> do that {{and to do it}} as soon as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is noted}} in the Barron Report that Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Robert Lowry was aware of Jackson and Kerr's {{involvement}} in the Strathearn killing, {{and that they were}} not prosecuted for [...] "operational reasons". Mr. Justice Barron was highly critical of the RUC's failure to properly investigate Jackson. Weir declared [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> make it clear that this collusion between loyalist paramilitaries such as Robin Jackson and my RUC colleagues and me was taking place with the full knowledge of my superiors".|$|E

The one we write (and {{which is called}} [...] "Portuguese"), and another one that we speak (which is so despised {{that there is not}} a name to call it). The latter is the mother tongue of Brazilians, the former has to be learned in school, and a majority of population does not manage to master it appropriately.... Personally, I do not object to us writing Portuguese, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> make clear that Portuguese is (at least in Brazil) only a written language. Our mother tongue is not Portuguese, but Brazilian Vernacular. This is not a slogan, nor a political statement, it is simply recognition of a fact.... There are linguistic teams working hard in order to give the full description of the structure of the Vernacular. So, there are hopes, that within some years, we will have appropriate grammars of our mother tongue, the language that has been ignored, denied and despised for such a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron {{condemned}} the protests, saying [...] "violence is absolutely unjustified in those {{and in other}} circumstances." [...] MP Naomi Long said that Northern Ireland is facing [...] "an incredibly volatile and extremely serious situation". She also called on Cameron to intervene after a police car outside her office was firebombed with a policewoman escaping injury in early December. On 13 January, {{she said that the}} party had no regrets in its decision to limit the days the Union Jack would fly over the city hall. First Minister Peter Robinson said on 13 January that the political process was the only way forward in developing cordial relations. [...] "We took some difficult decisions, some might say historic decisions to build a shared society in Northern Ireland. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> tell the wider community in Northern Ireland and our friends {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom that we are not giving up on that. We are very much of the view that we are determined that we build the kind of society where everybody can have a peaceful and stable existence." [...] He and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness were due to meet the British and Irish governments the following week and that Robinson would make it [...] "very clear" [...] about the condemnation of the wider Northern Ireland community for the violence. Robinson added that Northern Ireland's international image was getting damaged by the violence.|$|E

5000|$|Ninety-nine {{percent of}} <b>it</b> (Migrant) <b>was</b> written on piano, so I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> felt {{right to keep}} that a focal point. But also, I <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{conscious}} decision to make it a slightly more stripped-down record, as far as the scope and the grandeur goes. The idea was to keep the tone in general a little bit smaller with not so many doubles and big rock guitar and heavy spots on the record...with the lyrics of this new record being transparently about myself, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to not dehumanize the performances by over-layering them or over-doubling them. As you double vocals, they lose their intimate inflection, and whatever transparent emotion that's trying to be conveyed in them is washed out, which can be a good thing. For this record, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> not to do that.|$|R

The third reason why we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> this work of Lady Clark had a deep effect on, and was an inspiration for, the great Elizabeth David.|$|R

From tailoring, to supplying for department stores, to having a department store counter, to having my own boutiques, and now to manufacturing uniforms for corporate companies.
