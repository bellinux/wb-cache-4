50|$|Adult meerkats (Suricata suricatta) {{have been}} shown to teach pups {{essential}} prey-handling skills. Meerkats often consume dangerous prey (such as venomous scorpions) that inexperienced pups appear unable to safely subdue and consume without assistance from older individuals. Adults only display teaching behavior in response to pup begging calls, and adults modify their specific <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> based upon the age of the pup begging (providing more assistance to younger, presumably less experienced pups). In some instances, providing prey to pups appears costly to adults. Pups are initially unable to find and consume any of their own prey and more rapidly gain predatory abilities through learning experiences from a “teacher”, suggesting that adult teaching facilitates both the speed and efficiency of skill acquisition.|$|E

MethodsTwenty-four first-year cardiothoracic surgery residents and 20 faculty participated in the Boot Camp vessel anastomosis sessions. A portable chest model with synthetic graft and target vessels and a tissue-based porcine model simulated coronary artery anastomosis. After each 2 -hour session on days 1 and 2, residents assessed <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> of faculty using a 20 -item questionnaire based on the 5 -point Likert scale. After session on day 1, faculty completed a self-assessment questionnaire. At 3 months, faculty completed self-assessment questionnaires regarding <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> in simulation and clinical settings. Each questionnaire item represents 1 or more teaching categories: “learning climate,” “control of session,” “communication of goals,” “promoting understanding and retention,” “evaluation,” “feedback,” and “self-directed learning. ”ResultsGenerally, resident ratings indicated that faculty showed positive <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Faculty self-assessment ratings were all lower (P < . 025) than those assigned {{to them by the}} residents except for 1 component representative of “feedback,” which approached significance (P = . 04); 2 items, representative of “promoting understanding and retention” and “evaluation”, had mean scores of less than 3. At 3 months, compared with self-assessment at Boot Camp, faculty ratings suggested improved <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> in their simulation settings in the following: “learning climate,” “control of session,” “communication of goals,” “promoting understanding and retention,” and “evaluation. ” The simulation environment was perceived as more positive for technical skills training in certain aspects compared with clinical setting: instructor reviewed function and operation of equipment with learner before session (representative of “promoting understanding and retention”) and instructor allowed the learner ample time to practice (representative of “control of session” and “promoting understanding and retention”) (P < . 025). ConclusionsSimulation-based skills training is perceived by residents to be associated with positive <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Faculty self-ratings indicate that they do not always use many of these <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> and that their performance can be improved.

The researcher used a descriptive survey that explores and describes student perceptions of effective teaching in the classroom. The questionnaire consisted of items which were designed to assess Darling-Hammond's <b>Teaching</b> <b>Behaviors</b> for Powerful Learning (2008).

Purposes: To develop a Clinical Teaching Behavior Inventory (CTBI) for nurse preceptors' self-evaluation, and for new graduate nurse preceptee evaluation of preceptor clinical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> and to test the validity and reliability of the CTBI. Methods: This study used mixed research techniques in five phases. Phase I: based on a literature review, the researchers developed an instrument to measure clinical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Phase II: 17 focus group interviews were conducted with 63 preceptors and 24 new graduate nurses from five hospitals across Taiwan. Clinical teaching behavior themes were extracted from the focus group data and integrated into the domains and items of the CTBI. Phase III: two rounds of an expert Delphi study were conducted to determine the content validity of the instrument. Phase IV: a total of 290 nurse preceptors and 260 new graduate nurses were recruited voluntarily in the same five hospitals in Taiwan. Of these, 521 completed questionnaires to test the construct validity of CTBI by using confirmatory factory analysis. Phase V: the internal consistency and reliability of the instrument were tested. Results: CTBI consists of 23 items in six domains: (1) 'Committing to Teaching'; (2) 'Building a Learning Atmosphere'; (3) 'Using Appropriate Teaching Strategies'; (4) 'Guiding Inter-professional Communication'; (5) 'Providing Feedback and Evaluation'; and (6) 'Showing Concern and Support'. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded a good fit and reliable scores for the CTBI- 23 model.

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} trend study (Gall, Borg & Gall, 1996) {{examined the}} effectiveness of a one-semester university-based teacher induction program as compared to a two-semester university-based teacher induction program based on the observation scores of classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> urban novice teachers exhibited {{during the first year of}} teaching. These scores were further analyzed in relation to the socio-economic level of the school and the grade level taught. Additionally, the study explored the past participants?????? perceptions of the teacher induction program components of a one-semester program and a two-semester program during their fifth year of teaching. Their perceptions were also examined in relation to the socio-economic level of the school and the grade level taught. The study examined the observation scores of classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> of 145 urban novice teachers participating in either a one-semester or two-semester universitybased teacher induction program. The urban novice teachers demonstrated growth over time as measured by the first and final observation scores of classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, the length of the university-based teacher induction program did not affect the observation scores of classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Further, neither the socio-economic level of the school nor the grade level taught affected the observation scores of classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Although the three components of the university-based teacher induction program received high means, 82 past participants of a one-semester or a two-semester teacher induction program responding to the Teacher Induction Program Participant Survey (TIPPS) recognized formative observation as the most effective component. Peer support and professional development were perceived second and third respectively. No statistical significant differences of the one-semester or two-semester past participants?????? perceptions of peer support, professional development or formative observation were found related to the socio-economic level of the school or the grade level taught...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine faculty {{perceptions}} of their institution 2 ̆ 7 s ethical climate and how selected faculty characteristics may or may not influence their perceptions. The current research was constructed around the major environments found within colleges and universities: (a) classroom, (b) student, and (c) administrative. Five ethical principles were applied to each of the environments to develop items for a campus ethical climate measure. The central questions guiding this research were: (a) Do faculty have different perceptions of the campus ethical climate and do their perceptions vary across institutional type, academic discipline, or professorial rank?; and (b) Do faculty perceptions of the campus ethical climate relate to their self-reported ethical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and is the relationship different for institutional type, academic discipline, or professorial rank?^ To answer these questions, the Campus Ethical Climate Inventory (CECI) and the College <b>Teaching</b> <b>Behaviors</b> (CTB) scale were administered to a sample of 549 faculty at a research university and a comprehensive university in the midwest. Results of an exploratory factor analysis supported the existence of the three major college environments: student, classroom, and administrative. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test for differences in faculty perceptions across institutional type, academic discipline, and professorial rank. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences in faculty self-reported ethical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> across institutional type, academic discipline, and professorial rank. A regression analysis was used to test the relationship between faculty perceptions of the campus ethical climate and faculty self-reported ethical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> ^ Results showed that faculty perceptions of the campus ethical climate differ significantly across institutional type but not academic discipline or professorial rank. Faculty self-reported ethical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors</b> did not differ across institutional type, academic discipline or professorial rank. Also, faculty perceptions of the campus ethical climate were significantly associated with their self-reported ethical <b>teaching</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Institutional type, academic discipline, and professorial rank, however, did not make a significant contribution to the relationship between perceptions and behaviors. An interpretation of these findings is given as are suggestions for future study. ...|$|E
