[...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The nice thing about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing.</b> And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing,</b> and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was some}} time ago. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> around us every day. It is {{possible}} that within {{a very short time}} I may find myself in such a position here that I am forced to know exactly who are my friends and who my enemies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's as may be," [...] said Lotta {{as though}} she had her doubts upon the subject. [...] "That's as may be. But it isn't easy to put a young woman away now without her will. Things have changed--partly for the worse, perhaps, and partly for the better. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> every day. My wonder is that he should wish to many her." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was aware}} {{presently}} that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing,</b> {{that the light}} was losing its diviner rays, that in some indescribable manner the glory and the assurance diminished.|$|R
50|$|Early 2009, {{the band}} left their {{management}} and booking agency. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> and this set {{the mood for}} the follow up album, The Turn. The band locked themselves up at The Ling residence and began pre-production.|$|R
25|$|But by then <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing.</b> Henry IV died in 1413 {{and his son}} King Henry V {{began to}} adopt a more conciliatory {{attitude}} to the Welsh. Royal pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they don't}} mind it. Besides, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing.</b> The auto, the telephone, rural free delivery; they're {{bringing}} the farmers in closer {{touch with the}} town. Takes time, you know, to change a wilderness like this was fifty years ago. But already, why, they can hop into the Ford or the Overland and get in to the movies on Saturday evening quicker than you could get down to 'em by trolley in St. Paul." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{fault of}} the {{military}} man is that he studies too much, reads too much history, is over reflective. If, instead, he would look about him more he would notice that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing.</b> Someone has told the British military man that Waterloo was won upon the playing fields of Eton. So he goes to Eton and plays. One of these days he will {{be called upon to}} fight another Waterloo: and afterwards--when it is too late--they will explain to him that it was won not upon the play field but in the class room.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that a way has opened out of the difficulty. I don't want him {{to go back to school}} again. He knows quite as much Latin as is required, in an {{importer}} of wines. I want him to learn Spanish and Portuguese, and to become a gentleman, and a man of the world. I have stuck to Philpot Lane, all my life; but there is no reason why he should do so, after me. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> in the city, and many of our merchants no longer live there, but have houses in the country, and drive or ride to them. Some people shake their heads over what they call newfangled notions. I think it is good for a man to get right away from his business, when he has done work.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{the tour}} in America that year where the band noticed <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing.</b> They <b>were,</b> {{according}} to Gore, [...] "shocked {{by the way}} the fans were turning up in droves at the concerts". He said that although the concerts were selling well, they were still struggling to sell records.|$|R
3000|$|Even setting {{identification}} issues aside, {{these estimates}} do not isolate {{the effects of}} competition on productivity {{in the sense of}} Hoxby (2002). Many <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> for Chilean schools during this period, including the distribution of students (and hence potential peer effects) and levels of funding. 23 Taken at face value, however, these findings suggest that competition had a modest effect on average school productivity. 24 [...]...|$|R
2500|$|And then Bernie [...] who {{is totally}} non-technical and had always left that side {{completely}} to me, {{started to get}} involved on the technical side. We had had 16 years with never a cross word until then, and <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> with his deeper and deeper involvement in [...] Then McLaren made approaches to me and I just felt {{it was the end}} of the road at Brabham." ...|$|R

50|$|Organization mentor: Politics in the {{organizations}} are constantly changing. It {{is important to}} be knowledgeable about the values, strategies and products that are within your company, but also when these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing.</b> An organization mentor can clarify missions and strategies, and give clarity when needed.|$|E
50|$|It's a {{good time}} for the Moffats to be storing up memories, because <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing.</b> Baby Rufus is growing up, and Sylvie is getting ready to marry Reverend Mr. Abbot. Soon Joey will be taking a {{full-time}} job. But the museum helps them celebrate and remember their past as they face the future together.|$|E
50|$|Philosopher Thomas Hobbes' Elementa Philosophica de Cive (1642-1658) was in Latin. However, <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> and {{by about}} 1700 the growing {{movement}} {{for the use}} of national languages (already found earlier in literature and the Protestant religious movement) had reached academia, and an example of the transition is Isaac Newton's writing career, which began in New Latin and ended in English: Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in Latin Opticks, 1704, in English.|$|R
5000|$|By 1908 <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> - the {{population}} growth was accelerating {{due to the}} development of the brickfields and the construction of Tolworth Sewage Farm (opened in 1891) [...] - both in Red Lion Lane. (Now Red Lion Road) With a proper sewerage system Tolworth was ready for development. St Matthew’s Church had been built for a congregation of 800 and trams now ran from the Red Lion.|$|R
5000|$|Mike Howe {{spoke about}} his {{absence from the}} music scene for two decades before {{his return to the}} band in 2015. He said: [...] "I dropped off the radar because the record {{business}} really disappointed me. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing,</b> grunge <b>was</b> coming up and we were getting ignored. We were not businessmen, we were musicians, and like a lot of other bands, we just wanted to write songs and play metal." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the world}} {{we can see that}} at least some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>{{changing}}.</b> Whatever is changing is being changed by something else. If that by which it is changing is itself changed, then it too is being changed by something else. But this chain cannot be infinitely long, so there must be something that causes change without itself changing. This everyone understands to be God.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2015, Iglesias {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. [...] "We salute and support him," [...] he told reporters. [...] "The fact that at this moment Jeremy Corbyn is the favourite to win... and make a 180-degree turn from the direction set out by Tony Blair shows how much <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> across Europe." [...] Iglesias added: [...] "A different Labour Party that returns to its origins {{as a representative of}} the popular classes is, I believe, very important." ...|$|E
50|$|Ramona {{sees herself}} as fearless, and is {{sometimes}} surprised {{to realize that}} others don't agree. It's the summer after kindergarten, and <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> at the Quimby house. Ramona prepares to enter the first grade, Mrs. Quimby has a part-time job, and the family is having an extra bedroom added on to the house. Ramona bravely confronts bullies at the play ground and a mean dog {{on her way to}} school, but she isn't prepared for how scary it feels going to sleep in the brand new bedroom - alone.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} {{started in}} 2003 when the official editor and a script documentation for Fallout was released. It took 10 years because developers underestimated {{the project and}} many works. Because of it many <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> during the development and the original idea of what would story be about was completely changed. The mod was completed and released in 2013. The English translated version of the mod was released on July 15, 2016.|$|R
5000|$|And then Bernie {{owner of}} the team who is totally non-technical and had always left that side {{completely}} to me, started to get involved on the technical side. We had had 16 years with never a cross word until then, and <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> with his deeper and deeper involvement in Formula One Constructors Association.

5000|$|An Icelandic Odyssey is {{a two-part}} concept album series by Norwegian avant-garde metal band Solefald. The first part, Red for Fire, was {{released}} on 18 October 2005, while the second part, Black for Death, {{was released on}} 24 November 2006. The band {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "Solefald was experimenting when everybody was being true. Now that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> and that we've pushed the experiment quite far already, we wanted Red for Fire plus Black for Death to be our attempts at being 'true'. This will be a true Nordic Viking metal album." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{a desolate}} stretch of highway, Kevin decides to begin hitchhiking. He finally gets {{picked up by}} an elderly couple and much to his {{surprise}} he finds Winnie in the backseat. Winnie was fired over the fight Kevin instigated at the resort. Kevin and Winnie begin to argue and the elderly couple gets fed up and kicks {{them out of the}} car. A flash rain storm begins and Kevin and Winnie search for shelter. They find a barn and discuss how much <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> and the prospects for the future. They make up and kiss passionately. (It is loosely implied that the two lose their virginity with each other.) ...|$|E

[...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for Captain America: The First Avenger it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing.</b> And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments.

30|$|Comment 13 : “…. like WhatsApp, I’ve {{got lots}} of groups for classes. They were helpful now with these [students] protests where maybe <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> {{all the time and}} you needed to send the information. So you just send the message on WhatsApp group and {{everyone}} is aware. So what I usually do is {{at the beginning of each}} and every course I’ll have the class rep create a WhatsApp group and then put everyone in there….” (ENG 1).|$|R
50|$|Although {{the side}} may have {{finished}} 16th and collected only its second wooden spoon in season 1999, <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> around Victoria Park, including the ground itself. It now hosted its final two {{home and away}} matches (losses to West Coast in round three and Brisbane in round 22), whilst seeing the end of Shaw as coach, Brown as captain and the introduction at season's end of some likely lads in Josh Fraser, Rhyce Shaw and Ben Johnson, as well as current coach Mick Malthouse.|$|R
50|$|Age: 28. In the beginning, he was {{introduced}} in business circles {{as a friend of}} Sung-gu. But when Sung-gu withdrew from social circles, Joon-soo inherited the fame that Sung-gu once had. People knew him as Joon-soo from then on. But Joon-soo and Sung-gu were very tight friends. Sung-gu had everything that Joon-soo could never possibly have. But <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing</b> as Joon-soo started dating Da-ae. Sung-gu wanted to check out Joon-soo’s girlfriend. In fact, he wanted to steal her from him. Joon-soo knew what was going on. But Da-ae resisted the idea.|$|R
5000|$|Others {{regard the}} current {{pace of change}} as much too slow, and {{activism}} as too limited. Sumayya Jabarti, editor of the Arab News, says {{there are too many}} women with decision-making power who are like [...] "queen bees," [...] doing nothing to question the status quo. [...] "People say <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing</b> for women because they are comparing it to before, when things were below zero. People say 'change,' but it is all relative and it is very, very limited ... Change is not coming, we are taking it ... I don't think the way is paved. I think we are building it through the route taken ... Most of the time, we are walking in place." ...|$|E
5000|$|Clive Phillpot defines artists' {{books as}} a [...] "book of which {{an artist is}} the author" [...] in an issue of Art Documentation. Phillpot recognizes the {{fluidity}} of artists' books, and later defines them as [...] "books or booklets produced by the artist using mass-production methods, and in (theoretically) unlimited numbers, in which the artist documents or realizes art ideas or artworks." [...] On the discovery of artists' books, Phillpot philosophizes {{on the nature of}} experiencing art in unknown outlets: [...] "What can be so beautiful, at a time when <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing,</b> is that one cannot fully understand what one has in one's hands, or what indeed is happening more generally. To lose that confusion later is almost sad." ...|$|E
5000|$|Scorpions started {{actively}} {{to work on}} a {{new album}} while touring in 2002. Drummer James Kottak said: [...] "We would sit {{in the back of the}} tour bus late night, playing each other songs each of us had written, writing, listening to new stuff on the radio, and brainstorming what each one of us thought which direction should the new CD take". The band had the back lounge of a tour bus converted into a studio to write, rehearse and record the demos of the new songs. Guitarist Matthias Jabs said in that period that the new material would be classic rock. He explained: [...] "We are classic rock, and most radio stations don't play that. But a lot of <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>changing,</b> so you never know." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{newsroom}} on CTC {{was subject}} to extensive staff cuts and the cancellation of the half-hour weekend bulletin was the most obvious sign <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing.</b> Over the next five years, limited resources were invested into the newsroom and technical glitches were becoming more obvious to viewers. Ten year old camera tapes were having to be reused with tape wear showing on screen. Sound desks from the early 1970s were also beginning to fail leading to breaks in audio on-air. Despite the lack of investment in technical equipment, the CTC newsroom maintained its legacy of quality news through its selection of local and national stories and broad coverage of international news.|$|R
60|$|Time, which changes every <b>thing,</b> <b>is</b> <b>changing</b> {{even the}} traditionary {{appearance}} of forlorn Jerusalem. Not that its mien, after all, was ever very sad. Its airy site, its splendid mosque, its vast monasteries, the bright material {{of which the}} whole city is built, its cupolaed houses of freestone, and above all the towers and gates and battlements of its lofty and complete walls, always rendered it a handsome city. Jerusalem has not been sacked so often or so recently as the other two great ancient cities, Rome and Athens. Its vicinage was never more desolate than the Campagna, or the state of Attica and the Morea in 1830.|$|R
50|$|Civil Service was at {{its peak}} just before the First World War but <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>changing,</b> with the Gaelic Athletic Association {{establishing}} its dominance. After the Second World War, Civil Service reverted to its junior status and it has since prospered to varying degree. Now, the club’s membership includes Australians, Indians, Pakistanis and South Africans. The Civil Service link lives on - club president Fintan Butler, is based in the Office of Public Works and his son Owen, who started his career in Civil Service, later went on to play for Ireland. Aidan Kinsella, who was {{the captain of the}} club’s second team, is also based in the Office of Public Works.|$|R
