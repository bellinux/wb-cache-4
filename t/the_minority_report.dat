5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. <b>The</b> <b>minority</b> <b>report,</b> authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|The philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts {{was active}} in the East End, {{alleviating}} poverty by founding a sewing school for ex-weavers in Spitalfields and building the ornate Columbia Market in Bethnal Green. She helped to inaugurate the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was a keen supporter of the 'Ragged School Union', and operated housing schemes {{similar to those of the}} Model Dwellings Companies such as the East End Dwellings Company and the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, where investors received a financial return on their philanthropy. Between the 1890s and 1903, when the work was published, the social campaigner Charles Booth instigated an investigation into the life of London poor (based at Toynbee Hall), much of which was centred on the poverty and conditions in the East End. Further investigations were instigated by the 'Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09', the Commission found it difficult to agree, beyond that change was necessary and produced separate minority and majority reports. <b>The</b> <b>minority</b> <b>report</b> was the work of Booth with the founders of the London School of Economics Sidney and Beatrice Webb. They advocated focusing on the causes of poverty and the radical notion of poverty being involuntary, rather than the result of innate indolence. At the time their work was rejected but was gradually adopted as policy by successive governments.|$|E

25|$|After {{a year of}} {{thorough}} investigation – with 20,000 pages of testimony given by 193 witnesses, the Agrava Board submitted two reports to President Marcos – the Majority and Minority Reports. <b>The</b> <b>Minority</b> <b>Report,</b> submitted by Chairman Agrava alone, was submitted on October 23, 1984.

Excluding Chairman Agrava, the majority of the board submitted a separate report – the Majority Report – indicting several members of the Armed Forces including Ver, General Luther Custodio, and General Prospero Olivas, head of AVSECOM.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, 1896, {{thousands}} of people waited outside the Coliseum, hoping to hear the platform debate. [...] The galleries were quickly packed, but the delegates, slowed by fatigue from {{the first two days}} and the long journey from the downtown hotels, were slower to arrive. It was not until 10:45am, three-quarters of an hour late, that Chairman White called the convention to order. [...] Bryan arrived during the delay; he was greeted with a musical tribute from one of the convention bands, which then returned to playing a medley of Irish melodies. [...] Once White started the proceedings, he turned over the gavel to Senator Jones, who read the proposed platform to great applause from silver delegates, and hissing from gold men.

500|$|Since the {{disappearance}} of his son Sean, PreCrime Captain John Anderton has both separated from his wife Lara and become a drug addict. While United States Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer is auditing the program, the Precogs generate a new prediction, saying Anderton will murder a man named Leo Crow in 36 hours. Anderton does not know Crow, but flees the area as Witwer begins a manhunt. Anderton seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman, the creator of PreCrime technology. She reveals that sometimes, one of the Precogs, usually Agatha, has a different vision than the other two, a [...] "minority report" [...] of a possible alternate future; this has been kept a secret as it would damage the system's credibility. Anderton resolves to recover <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> <b>report</b> to prove his innocence.|$|E
500|$|When {{order was}} {{restored}} after Bryan's speech, the convention passed the platform, voting down <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> <b>report</b> and a resolution {{in support of}} the Cleveland administration; it then recessed for a few hours until 8:00pm, when nominating speeches were to be made. [...] According to The Boston Globe, Bryan [...] "had locked himself within the four walls at the Clifton House, down town, and there blushes unseen. [...] The dark horse is in his stall, feasting on the oats of hope and political straws." [...] Bryan had made no arrangements for formal nominating speeches given the short timeframe, and was surprised when word was brought to him at the Clifton House that he had been nominated by Henry Lewis of Georgia: the candidate had expected the Kansas delegation to name him. As Missouri Senator George Vest nominated Bland, his oratory was drowned out by the gallery, [...] "Bryan, Bryan, W.J. Bryan".|$|E
500|$|The {{final report}} of the {{tribunal}} was released on 13 June 1928 and consisted of both a majority report and a minority one, since {{not all of the}} tribunal members agreed on the validity of Savidge's evidence. The majority report said that Savidge was not intimidated into answering questions, nor treated inappropriately, and that [...] "we are unable therefore to accept Miss Savidge's statement. We are satisfied that the interrogation followed the lines indicated to [...] by the Director of Public Prosecutions and was not unduly extended". <b>The</b> <b>minority</b> <b>report</b> blamed the police, particularly Collins, for the method in which Savidge was interviewed. The inquiry resulted in three changes to police procedure, however: firstly, that anyone interrogated should be told beforehand about the possible consequences and purpose of the statement; secondly, that the statement should normally be taken at home; and thirdly, that in cases [...] "involving matters intimately affecting [...] morals" [...] another woman should always be present for any interviews.|$|E

500|$|Farrell's {{supporting}} roles {{include an}} ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise, a potential criminal in Minority Report (2002), and the villain Bullseye in Daredevil (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered <b>the</b> <b>Minority</b> <b>Report</b> role, turning {{it down to}} appear in Ocean's Eleven. Farrell said [...] "he had no problem" [...] being the producer's fallback after Damon declined. Bullseye is an assassin, proud of his accuracy. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and {{just the way they}} move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing...he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it's not exactly a character you can do method acting for...you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips". That year, he was voted sixth World's [...] "Sexiest Man" [...] by Company magazine.|$|E
500|$|The film {{presents}} a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the {{images from the}} minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges. The judges appear via video feeds, analyze the images, and according to Cooper, they view the images, listen to Anderton rattle off [...] "a string of legalistic verbiage", then give it a [...] "pro forma ratification." [...] Thus the accused is never present, is not allowed a defense, and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial. The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion, as in its tag line: [...] "It works." [...] Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama, the audience is treated {{as if it were the}} jury, but in this system, instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent, the audience seeks instead to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess. But to do so, Anderton has to disprove the system, which he does by proving the existence of <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> <b>report.</b> This renders the PreCrime justice system inoperable, as if there is doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images, or their ability to be interpreted, but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances, then the system of infallible guilt can not exist.|$|E
