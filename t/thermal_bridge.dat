50|$|Concrete {{floors and}} edge beams, {{especially}} at the corners, are common thermal bridges. Physical heat conductivity for concrete material are 2~4 times higher than ordinary brick materials, which are usually used for facade enclosures. Meanwhile, if the indoor environment is not vented enough, the brick material will slowly absorb rainwater and also humidity into the wall. When the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor space is large, the indoor warm and humid air could condense in this area. Insulation layer’s R-value will be reduced significantly by humidity, thus the thermal performance for insulation wall is not evenly distributed. The more humidity, the worse thermal performance. This uneven distribution finally cause <b>thermal</b> <b>bridge</b> for large area, sometimes the whole enclosure system.Because of multiple factors such as orientation, daylight, ventilation, temperature and human factors, the distribution of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridge</b> could also be uneven for a single building, which accounts for the phenomena that sometimes while some units are severely affected by thermal distribution together with mildew, some units are slightly affected.|$|E

[...] The facade of the tower is formed of two parts, the concrete brutalist structure, and wood and glass assembly storefront systems. Many of the original single panes of glass have been replaced, either with double glazing in the existing wood frame, or plexiglass. The overall result is a minimal improvement in thermal performance. Overall the wood facade elements are warped and cracking, and do not seal well. The single-layer construction bleeds heat at an appreciable rate. Further, the concrete elements bridge from the outdoors to the indoors, conducting heat from the interior to the exterior, where the concrete acts as a heat fin in a phenomenon called a <b>Thermal</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{strategy for}} climate mitigation is reduction of energy use in buildings. One {{approach is to}} build or renovate buildings applying passive house design or a zero-energy building approach. The first step towards passive house design is reduction of heat losses, and therefore improving the thermal resistance of the building envelope. This is reached by adding more insulation and/or insulation with low thermal conductivity. A recent study shows that professionals unfortunately are not always aware {{of the concept of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> combined with different definitions of measuring of building elements. Furthermore, the effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> is usually taken into account using simplified methods which may not be correct. This paper explains the differences in different measuring methods which may be applied today according to European standards, and the possible impact on the specific values of linear <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges.</b> The results show that the relative effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> may increase when the thermal resistance of the building envelope is improved. It also shows that the difference between simplified calculations and more accurate calculations increases when the thermal resistance of the building envelope is improved. The case study shows that the effect of misunderstandings or carelessly handling of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> in the design phase may lead to an underestimation of peak power for space heating and energy demand for heating by 29 % and 37 % respectively. To minimize the risk for undersized heating systems and increased space heating demand, subscripts indicating the applied measuring method (used in calculations to determine specific values of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges)</b> should always be used when <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> are presented...|$|R

The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges.</b> In particular, a metal panel curtain wall comprises a number of <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges</b> in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges.</b> For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal panel curtain wall were evaluated. The alternative metal panel curtain wall that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through <b>thermal</b> <b>bridges.</b> As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal panel curtain wall was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal panel curtain wall. In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal panel curtain wall building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal panel curtain wall.
