A set of pedagogical patterns for networked Second language (L 2) learning, categorized and undergirded by rapid collaborative knowledge improvement (RCKI) principles, has been extracted and articulated in our school-based research. The patterns are distilled {{from a series of}} over 60 Chinese language lessons conducted in real classrooms which are co-designed by teachers and researchers over a 3 -year period in Singapore schools. Each principle-based pedagogical pattern is presented succinctly in a simple pattern language. Two classroom scenarios of collaborative activities are elucidated, embodying some of the patterns to provide a more grounded feel of how they are enacted in practice. RCKI principle-based pedagogical patterns inform the design of collaborative language learning activities in networked classrooms.

Feedback is an important tool for instructors <b>to</b> use <b>to</b> <b>scaffold</b> <b>student</b> <b>learning,</b> especially {{in the context of}} an ill-structured project. An ethnographic approach is taken for data collection; audio recordings and field notes are taken throughout the duration of the project.

Student work products, post-DMM surveys, and post-project interviews are also considered as data sources for this research. The results of this research show that instructor feedback in this project is adaptable, conforming to the status of the student team at the beginning of the DMM. This adaptability is highlighted by differences in DMM themes that are supported by differences in the Design Strategy Memos that student teams bring to the meeting.

40|$|AbstractTo many teachers, {{assessments}} are still {{used as the}} endpoint of instruction. Though scholars and researchers have advocated the use of assessment data as evidence to inform teaching, {{teachers need to be}} shown how this is done and involvement in professional development (PD) program that equips teachers with these skills is pertinent. In addition, many authors and researchers (to name a few: Penn-Edwards, 2010; Schulman & Armitage, 2005 and Zakaria & Care, 2010) have consistently testified that for PD programs to yield effective results they must also target teacher beliefs. The study aims to identify how a teachers’ professional development program known as the Assessment and Learning Partnerships (ALPs) program changes teacher beliefs, knowledge and teaching practice {{and the degree to which}} this occurs. ALPs is currently participated by teachers of more than 200 schools across the state of Victoria, Australia. It promotes the use of a specific style of evidence-based teaching and its operation within a developmental learning paradigm is designed to lead to an improvement of <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> outcomes. Teachers based their teaching on developmental learning framework and evidence is used to identify students’ zones of proximal development which illustrate <b>student</b> readiness in <b>learning.</b> Teachers then use this information <b>to</b> <b>scaffold</b> <b>student</b> <b>learning</b> and target intervention. Data is collected longitudinally at two points of time over a period of one year. Three domains are tapped onto: teacher beliefs, knowledge and practice through the use of survey, knowledge test, teaching observations and semi-structured interviews. Data will then be triangulated to provide information about change in beliefs and practice. The discussion in this paper focuses on the data collected from the first round of survey administration. This data serves as baseline measures and used to establish association and relationships between teacher beliefs and practice...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{technology}} in education (so-called e-learning) has seen a rapid development over the last decades. From being small systems that might assist lectures it has developed into systems that could potentially replace the lecture altogether, chief amongst these systems is blended and flipped learning. Blended seeking to combine e-learning with face-to-face instruction in the classroom, while flipped delivers e-learning outside the classroom while using class time to promote active learning. E-learning now seeks to replace what it once assisted. The research on blended and flipped learning often shows {{that it is more}} efficient than the traditional classroom, at least when measuring learning outcomes and that it is an effective way of promoting active <b>learning</b> amongst <b>students.</b> Similarly, the development of educational content for use in e-learning has evolved, from simple animations to more complex and interactive systems. Given these developments, and the wealth of material available (such as Khan Academy and iTunesU) it seems that it should be possible for all teachers to use blended or flipped learning in their classrooms. Therefore, it is of interest to see how educators use the instructional material, and how the students react to the uses, and how the material can be improved. This thesis examines these factors by delivering the same three instructional videos (IVs) to three chemistry- 1 teachers, gathering responses from both the teachers and their students (n= 58) on how the IVs were used, the student’s attitudes towards how the IVs were used, and teachers and students suggestions for improvements. These responses were analysed, and the results were viewed {{in the light of the}} theoretical knowledge on e-learning. The contributions of this thesis to the field of e-learning are twofold: How should IVs be designed? The study shows that IVs should utilize macro-level interactivity <b>to</b> <b>scaffold</b> <b>students</b> <b>learning,</b> as they tend to self-regulate poorly in an e-learning setting. This support for macro-level interactivity is well backed up in the literature. Additionally, IVs should be segmented as to apply the pacing principle. How should IVs be used? The study shows that the students most enjoyed a blended approach, utilizing collaborative problem-solving. Although many other factors could influence the student’s enjoyment, such as previous experience with e-learning. Furthermore, it was shown that pre-training in the use of interactive elements could be utilized, which also is a point is made in the literature. The study was a relatively small, qualitative study, but it gives some useful suggestions for how educators could use e-learning in their classroom, and how e-learning content could be designed as to optimize active <b>learning</b> amongst <b>students...</b>|$|R

Considering the dynamic feature of classroom discourse, L 1 appears to be context-specific in different IRF cycles rather than one-fits-all model.

Central features of authenticity and the social dimensionof the learning context are outlined and connected to notions of cognitive apprenticeship and scaffolding. These are, in turn, explored {{in terms of their}} relationship to impact on approaches to learning by reference to work on deep and surface approaches. It is argued that, in health professions education, situated learning is evidenced in two specific contexts—problem-based learning and clinical learning. These contexts then provide a focus in this collection for investigating the role of educational technologies in enhancing <b>student</b> <b>learning.</b> In problem-based learning, the level of authenticity may be simulated in online environments or gained through real problem scenarios and clinical cases enhanced by technologies. Such authentic environments can serve as a prompt to stimulate face-to-face and online discussions.

The tail (the retrieval system) is wagging the dog to within an inch of its life” (Nicholas, Rowlands, Withey, & Dobrowplski, 2008, p. 5). Our research seeks to challenge the surface learning of the new millennials. A prominent method is based on emergent learning theory centring round dialogue and interaction between student and educator. This approach of collective enterprise and collaborative learning is no longer tutor centred. This study presents our research of art and design students.

The issue of learner responsibility lies in student’s willingness to identify learning deficits, setting goals, managing the learning process, and monitoring the learning strategies they use. The issue of meaningful learning lies in providing students with realistic problems, which are conducive to the development of capable problem solvers. The issue of active knowledge construction lies in providing students with opportunities to engage in high-level thinking, reflection, and articulation activities, with suitable support <b>to</b> <b>scaffold</b> <b>students</b> in their pursuit of active learning...|$|R
