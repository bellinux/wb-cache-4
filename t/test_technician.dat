40|$|A main {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to de-termine an automatic strategy for parasite detec-tion in thick blood films. In Colombia malaria is still a major health problem and diagnosis has come to be of the domain of trained technician groups {{due to the lack of}} Medical resources. Such an automatic strategy would then be a useful fil-ter for the specialist to <b>test</b> <b>technician</b> diagnosis. This paper presents the development and valida-tion of an original automatic method to detect parasites in thick blood films. The algorithm is trained by selecting a number of correctly classi-fied pixels from each tissue, which are then used as input to a statistical classifier based on the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) decision rule in the RGB color space. A few samples of the classes to segment, i. e. red cells (RC), parasites (PA) and background (BG) are picked to obtain a represen-tation of the pattern space. The k-NN rule clas-sifies a given pixel within the category the most heavily represented among its k-Nearest Neigh-bors. Validation was performed on a group of eight images. Parasite was detected in the entire set of test images and the number of misclassfied pixels was observed to amount to 12. 24 %...|$|E
40|$|Processes at a {{semiconductor}} equipment manufacturing facility were studied {{with the goal}} to reduce the production lead time. Based {{on the principles of}} lean manufacturing, DMAIC methodology was used to guide the process. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) of the whole process was done to determine that the Universal End Station (UES) was the module with the longest lead time. This work focuses on the optimization of the testing process on the UES. Time studies were conducted for the assembly and test of the UES module and analysis of results revealed a testing process that is serial and thus of a very long duration. Further investigations revealed that some of the processes required the <b>test</b> <b>technician</b> to do manual calibrations and measurements which resulted in long test times. Based on the interviews with involved personnel, historical data analysis and the research carried out, specific tests were recommended for automated testing and parallel testing. A decision tree was developed to help aid in the selection of the suitable candidates for automation while a dependency network diagram was developed to aid in selection of candidates for parallel testing. It is projected that these recommendations will reduce the Testing lead time of UES by 8. 4 % and labor hours by 16. 3 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to the bronchoconstricting agent {{methacholine}} is {{a potential}} hazard to technical staff during methacholine challenge testing, which remains a useful and frequently per-formed test. There are several methods of performing the test. One of the 2 methods listed in the American Thoracic Society’s guidelines is the 2 -min tidal-breathing method. The methacholine can be inhaled using one of several methods. The loosely-fitting-mask method is likely to produce more contamination of the local environment than a filtered exhalation system. METHODS: We tested 2 variations of the tidal-breathing method of measuring the methacholine provocational concentra-tion (PC 20, the dose that produces a 20 % decrease in forced expiratory volume in the first second). One involved use of the open-mask technique {{and the other a}} T-piece-and-filter system that pre-cluded the release of methacholine-containing droplets into the environment. We performed du-plicate methacholine challenge tests with 10 subjects who had a wide range of PC 20. The tests were done in random order, and each subject performed one test using the mask and one using the T-piece/filter system. RESULTS: With the mask system the geometric mean PC 20 was 4. 7 mg/mL, versus 5. 1 mg/mL with the T-piece-filter system (p 0. 36). These values are very close and would not be substantially different clinically. CONCLUSION: The 2 methods are equivalent, and the low cost of the products used in the T-piece/filter method makes it suitable for reducing technician exposure to methacholine, using potentially completely disposable components.

40|$|AbstractSuppliers of shaker {{controllers}} {{often use}} {{a technique called}} ‘sigma clipping’ to prevent the amplifier from encountering too high amplitude peaks. Sigma clipping is most commonly used to make sure a shaker system will be sufficiently powerful to reproduce the required random spectrum. The level of clipping is measured via the crest factor, which is expressed as a ratio between the absolute maximum of the signal and its root-mean-square (RMS) value. Such clipped drive signals are therefore no longer Gaussian, since their probability distribution functions (PDF) are truncated at high values. The clipped drive signal is then amplified and filtered by a system {{made up of the}} shaker itself followed by the unit under test. Although the local stress and strain responses do not show any obvious clipping, their statistics may be affected. This can feed through to fatigue damage, which is known to be exponentially related to strain amplitudes. A legitimate question is therefore “how does clipping affect damage?”This paper studies and quantifies the influence of clipping experimentally, numerically and theoretically. There are many objectives and underlying questions to consider. For the <b>test</b> <b>technicians,</b> what level of clipping to choose in order to represent the damage due a Gaussian environment?

The authors evaluated whether cross-sectional associations of tibia lead with cognitive function were modified by neighborhood psychosocial hazards in the Baltimore Memory Study (2001 – 2005), a longitudinal cohort study of determinants of cognitive decline. Tibia lead was measured via 109 Cd-induced K-shell X-ray fluorescence. Neighborhood psychosocial hazards were measured independently of study subjects. Complete data were available among 1, 001 demographically diverse adults aged 50 – 70 years, randomly selected from 65 contiguous neighborhoods in Baltimore City.
