50|$|Mold Tapering: The twin-belt {{casting machine}} differs from other moving mold casting {{machines}} in that all four mold surfaces are independent. This allows the mold surfaces <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tapered</b> {{to remain in}} contact with the cast product as it shrinks. The high velocity cooling water, which is continuously applied to the backside of the belt, impinges on the belt and creates a force on the belt.This force acts to press the belt against the surface of the strip or slab as it shrinks, keeping the belt in close contact with the cast product throughout the mold. Each side of the mold is formed by an endless chain of dam blocks,which are held against the cast strip by adjustable spring-loaded guides.|$|E

Two pieces of AA 7075 alloy with thickness of 6 mm were friction stir welded by using conventional milling machine. The shoulder diameter used in this experiment is fixed at 18 mm. The taper pin ratio used are varied at 6 : 6, 6 : 5, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 and 6 : 1. The rotational speeds that were used in this study were 1000 rpm, 1200 rpm and 1400 rpm, respectively. The welding speeds used are 60 mm/min, 80 mm/min and 100 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} transtympanic administration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers to patients suffering from autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). STUDY DESIGN: Nonrandomized, prospective pilot study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: 9 patients (4 men and 5 women; aged 51. 22 +/- 13. 11 years) presenting with autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss who responded to oral steroid treatment. Two groups of patients were treated. Group A consisted of 5 patients with AIED {{who could not be}} tapered off steroids. Group B consisted of 4 patients who were treated with intratympanic anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy alone after a relapse of hearing loss following discontinuation of steroids. INTERVENTION: A Silverstein MicroWick local delivery system was placed in the round window niche and the patients were treated for 4 weeks with a weekly infusion of infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Evaluation of hearing thresholds at 250 - 8000 Hz was performed before and after implantation of the Silverstein MicroWick and local delivery of the TNF-alpha blocker. RESULTS: Local administration of the TNF-alpha blocker allowed methylprednisolone <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tapered</b> off without loss of hearing function in 4 / 5 steroid-dependent patients. Four additional patients were treated only with anti-TNF-alpha perfusion to the round window membrane without concomitant systemic administration of methylprednisolone. In 3 of these 4 patients, the pure tone average improved to 22. 6 +/- 15. 7 dB, resulting in hearing recovery comparable to treatment with systemic methylprednisolone. The 7 responding patients showed a significant reduction of recurrence of hearing loss to 0. 028 +/- 0. 072 episodes per month over the 4. 3 +/- 2. 4 months of the post-treatment period compared to 0. 84 +/- 0. 4 recurrences per week seen in the pretreatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot trial demonstrate that in patients with AIED, transtympanic delivery of the TNF-alpha blocker infliximab once weekly for 4 weeks allowed steroids <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tapered</b> off, resulted in hearing improvement and reduced disease relapses. These preliminary efficacy and safety results appear encouraging enough to warrant further follow-up and studies for better determination of the potential clinical utility of local administration of infliximab for autoimmune hearing loss.

40|$|The {{structural}} efficiency of carbon-epoxy tapered struts is considered through trade studies, detailed analysis, manufacturing and experimentation.

Lunar lander requirements include that the strut has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tapered</b> on both ends, complicating the design and limiting the manufacturing process. Optimal stacking sequences, geometries, and materials are determined and the sensitivity of the strut weight to each parameter is evaluated. The trade study results indicate that the most efficient carbon-epoxy struts are 30 percent lighter than the most efficient aluminum-lithium struts. Structurally efficient, highly loaded struts were fabricated and loaded in tension and compression to determine if they met the design requirements and to verify the accuracy of the analyses. Experimental evaluation of some of these struts demonstrated that they could meet the greatest Altair loading requirements in both tension and compression.

40|$|One {{major problem}} when using bonded fiber-reinforced plastic {{laminates}} to strengthen and upgrade existing structures {{is the high}} stresses in the adhesive layer, in the area {{close to the end}} of the laminate, which might govern the failure of the joint. One method that has been put forward as a means of reducing the stress concentration in this area, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> the end of the laminate. Although this method has been suggested by some design guidelines, no specific information is usually provided about the tapering type, required tapering length, and limitations associated with this method.

30|$|This article {{reviewed}} different metal-mediated {{methods to}} synthesize Si and SiGe NW. First, gold-assisted synthesis of SiGe NW from 350 to 400 °C on Si(111) substrates has been presented. The possibility {{to obtain a}} wide range of composition (0 to 50 % Ge in SiGe) by varying the gas flow ratio was shown. Second, the growth of silicon NW with silicides catalysts, such as PtSi, NiSi, and Pd 2 Si was reported. Those catalysts present an alternative to gold for the growth of NW with optimized electrical properties. The NW are grown through the VSS process which requires working at high temperatures. The uncatalyzed growth rate, classically important under these conditions, is inhibited by using gaseous HCl. It allows Cl surface coverage that impedes the precursor adsorption and decomposition thus preventing the NW <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tapered.</b> Finally, AFM-based mechanical characterization of single GaN NW is presented. It is shown that the apparent NW's Young's modulus seems to increase when the NW's diameter decreases. This could be explained by a reduction of the defect in small diameter NW and by an irregular cross section of the NW when the diameter increases.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} using topical cyclosporin A 0. 05 % (Restasis) {{for the treatment of}} paediatric allergic conjunctivitis. METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive cases of paediatric allergic conjunctivitis treated with Restasis between 2010 and 2013. Subjects with follow-up time less than 3 months after using Restasis were excluded. Itch severity score, symptom score, and sign score were compared before (baseline) and 3 months after using Restasis. RESULTS: In 27 eyes of 14 patients (mean age 10. 8 +/- 3. 2 years), 44. 4 % had allergic conjunctivitis, 33. 3 % had vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and 22. 2 % had atopic keratoconjunctivitis. The mean duration of ocular symptoms was 20. 4 +/- 13. 2 months. 92. 6 % of subjects were using steroid eye drop before Restasis.

However, {{there are no}} predictive factors that help to determine which patients with asthma are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tapered</b> off inhaled corticosteroids successfully. We examined whether any factor or combination of factors could help the clinician safely discontinue inhaled steroid therapy. Thirty-six asthmatic children whose symptoms were stable on low-dose beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) were divided by parental choice into two groups: maintenance BDP (n = 11) and no BDP (n = 25). Methacholine inhalation tests were performed {{at the beginning of}} the study and after 1 month. Twelve children (48 %) who had BDP discontinued developed exacerbations after 2 – 3 months, whereas there were no problems in the maintenance group. The no BDP group was retrospectively divided into two subgroups: exacerbation (+) and (−). The threshold to methacholine in the exacerbation (+) subgroup decreased significantly in advance of clinical symptoms. The two subgroups were analyzed statistically by two-group discriminant function analysis. The change in threshold to methacholine, the dose and potency of drugs, duration of asthma and gender (female) correlated with exacerbation. These results suggest that discontinuation of inhaled steroids should be done carefully, even in stable asthmatic children. The methacholine inhalation test, gender, drugs and history may be used as references for discontinuing inhaled steroids...|$|E
