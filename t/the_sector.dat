Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development.

40|$|This {{research}} compares {{systemic risk}} in <b>the</b> banking <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> insurance <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> construction <b>sector,</b> and <b>the</b> food <b>sector.</b> To measure systemic risk, we use extreme negative returns in stock market data for a time-varying {{panel of the}} 20 largest U.

3000|$|The actual {{unemployment}} rates increase with more severe punishment of informal work if [...] (y_l^F/y_l^I)ψ _l> 1. The {{reason for this}} is that the large concealment costs discourage workers from searching, and firms from opening vacancies, in <b>the</b> informal <b>sector.</b> Increased punishment of <b>the</b> informal <b>sector</b> will encourage further reallocation of search and workers away from <b>the</b> informal <b>sector,</b> where relatively efficient search methods are used, towards <b>the</b> formal <b>sector.</b> Total search efficiency then falls, inducing unemployment to increase. The fact that search becomes less efficient when reallocated towards <b>the</b> formal <b>sector</b> also has an impact on unemployment working through wage formation and tightness. As search is reallocated towards <b>the</b> formal <b>sector,</b> <b>the</b> wage demand is moderated in <b>the</b> formal <b>sector</b> and exaggerated in <b>the</b> informal <b>sector.</b> As <b>the</b> efficiency of search in <b>the</b> formal <b>sector</b> increases by less than the efficiency of search in <b>the</b> informal <b>sector</b> is reduced, <b>the</b> informal <b>sector</b> wage push will dominate <b>the</b> formal <b>sector</b> wage moderation. Thus, the incentives to open up a vacancy in <b>the</b> formal <b>sector</b> subsides <b>the</b> disincentives to open up a vacancy in the informal sector; <b>the</b> formal <b>sector</b> tightness will increase by less than <b>the</b> informal <b>sector</b> tightness falls when [...] (y_l^F/y_l^I)ψ _l> 1. The opposite holds if [...] (y_l^F/y_l^I)ψ _l< 1. In this case, too much search and too many firms are allocated into <b>the</b> informal <b>sector</b> as there is a relative cost advantage of producing underground. Total search efficiency would then improve when the government tries to combat <b>the</b> informal <b>sector.</b> <b>The</b> official unemployment rate always falls with more harsh punishment of informal activities as workers to a larger extent become formally employed.
