40|$|We have {{calculated}} part of O(α_S) QCD radiative correction to {{the total}} cross-section of top's threshold production in e^+e^-→ tt̅→ W^- b W^+b̅ reaction.

Thus, all O(α_S) corrections which are non-zero, can be classified as: 1) corrections to t t̅ nonrelativistic potential 2) corrections to the <b>top's</b> <b>width</b> 3) hard gluon correction to γ t t̅-vertex.
