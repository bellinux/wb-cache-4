5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} storms, {{in the areas}} where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings. <b>These</b> <b>have</b> been implemented, for instance, in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the small}} size of {{brachytherapy}} sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some of <b>these</b> <b>have</b> escaped into the environment to become orphaned sources. A radium needle was found in a Prague playground in 2011, radiating 500 µSv/h from one metre away.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen other radioisotopes {{have been}} {{characterized}} with atomic weights ranging from 89.93 u (90Ru) to 114.928 u (115Ru). Most of <b>these</b> <b>have</b> half-lives {{that are less}} than five minutes except 95Ru (half-life: 1.643 hours) and 105Ru (half-life: 4.44 hours).|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} twentieth century onwards, there has been much {{investigation}} of low-mass, radiative collectors; <b>these</b> <b>have</b> proved to be much more successful.|$|E

5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; {{it is unclear}} whether <b>these</b> <b>have</b> carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Two compounds that have been identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter is responsible for the brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
