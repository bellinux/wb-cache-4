5|$|Our {{way forward}} lies in decisively turning our backs on <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> {{practices}} that violate our greatest strength: our Constitution and the commitment it embodies {{to the rule}} of law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security. The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.|$|E
5|$|Playschool or leikskóli, is non-compulsory {{education}} for those {{under the age}} of six, and {{is the first step in}} the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 2007. The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> methods that playschools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible. However, the Ministry does not implement the regulations and guidelines; instead this is the responsibility of the local authority, who fund and administer playschools. In addition, the local authority employs representatives who supervise the playschools’ operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} creative industries (and especially design) in knowledge-intense industries is reflected {{not only in}} <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> studies on EU levels, but has initiated design and creative policies and programmes in the most advanced economies. Furthermore, design and creativity has been recognised on a regional and local level as a driving force for competitiveness, economic growth, job market, and citizen's satisfaction. The investment in creative and cultural industries are considered a significant component of EU growth in the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy; and designers are increasingly involved in innovation issues.|$|E
5|$|The use of violence, {{with scores}} dead and injured, is totally {{incompatible}} with <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> principles of any {{social democratic party}} anywhere in the world. Consequently, we consider that a party in government that does not listen, that does not move {{and that does not}} immediately initiate a process of meaningful change in these circumstances, cannot {{be a member of the}} Socialist International. We are, as of today, ceasing the membership of the NDP, however we remain determined to cooperate with all the democrats in Egypt striving to achieve an open, democratic, inclusive and secular state.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> {{practices}} {{which resulted}} in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

5|$|The 1942 Papuan {{campaign}} {{threw up}} {{a host of}} serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 {{that it looked like}} the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|A council-manager {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Norman since the adoption of its city charter on , 1919. A councilor from each of the city's eight council wards is elected to office every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective wards based on a plurality voting system; a councilor from each ward serves on the Norman City Council. A mayor is elected by the entire voting population of Norman and serves as an at-large councilor; the mayor serves for a term of three years. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government; it aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in the government. The City Council appoints a professional City Manager who is responsible for the day-to-day administrative activities of the city. The City of Norman has approximately 650 employees working in eleven departments and 31 boards and commissions that help oversee and implement <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> services of the city. The City Council meets bi-weekly in City Hall located at 201 W. Gray Street in downtown Norman; various boards and commissions meet in accordance with their own schedules. The present mayor of Norman is Lynne Miller (elected in 2016), and the city manager is Steve Lewis (appointed in 2007).
