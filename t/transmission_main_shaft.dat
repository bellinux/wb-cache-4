50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the <b>main</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shafts</b> which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is hydraulically-actuated, and gear selection is via cable operation.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via flat belts and pulleys. The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the <b>main</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shaft.</b> Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original flat belts and pulley wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] belts and pulleys which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} Chang Ssu-Hsun was as follows: {{they built a}} tower of three storeys (totalling) more than ten feet in height, within which was {{concealed}} all the machinery. It was round (at the top to symbolize) the heavens, and square (at the bottom to symbolize) the earth. Below there was set up the lower wheel (ti lun), lower shaft (ti chu), and the framework base (ti tsu). There were also horizontal wheels (heng lun), (vertical) wheels fixed sideways (tshe lun), and slanting wheels (hsieh lun, i.e. oblique gearing); bearings for fixing them in place (ting shen kuan), a central coupling device (chung kuan) and a smaller coupling device (hsiao kuan)(i.e. the escapement); with a <b>main</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>shaft</b> (thien chu). Seven jacks rang bells on the left, struck a large bell on the right, and beat a drum in the middle to indicate clearly {{the passing of the}} quarter(-hours).|$|R

50|$|The <b>main</b> power <b>shaft</b> {{entered the}} mill {{on the first}} floor through the south wall of bay 15.

The three longitudinal line-shaft runs took power from the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> (six on the first three floors), they were slung by hangers on the jack-beams.

40|$|Shaft {{fracture}} at {{an early}} stage of operation is a common problem for a certain type of wind turbine. To determine the cause of shaft failure a series of experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the chemical composition and mechanical properties. A detail analysis involving macroscopic feature and microstructure analysis of the material of the shaft was also performed to have an in depth knowledge of the cause of fracture. The experimental tests and analysis results show that there are no significant differences in the material property of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> when comparing it with the Standard, EN 10083 - 3 : 2006. The results show that stress concentration on the shaft surface close to the critical section of the shaft due to rubbing of the annular ring and coupled with high stress concentration caused by the change of inner diameter of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> are the <b>main</b> reasons that result in fracture of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In addition, inhomogeneity of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> micro-structure also accelerates up the fracture process of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> In addition, the theoretical calculation of equivalent stress {{at the end of the}} shaft was performed, which demonstrate that cracks can easily occur under the action of impact loads. The contribution of this paper is to provide a reference in fracture analysis of similar <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> of wind turbines...|$|R

2500|$|The basic {{mechanism}} of the Friden and Monroe, described above, was a modified Leibniz wheel (better known, perhaps informally, in the USA as a [...] "stepped drum" [...] or [...] "stepped reckoner").

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{research and}} discusses findings dealing with failure modes of gearboxes in wind turbines. These gearboxes fail in general {{after five years}} which is far below the expected design life of twenty years of a wind turbine. The research is taking a more holistic approach towards finding typical behaviour of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> taking the transient nature of the wind into consideration. In this research, a {{small scale wind turbine}} test rig has been designed and manufactured with displacement sensors installed to observe the displacement of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> at specific points, namely the main bearing locations of the forward framework of a wind turbine nacelle, where the <b>main</b> <b>shaft</b> is installed. The experimental data measured from the test rig is being analysed with common beam bending, statistical and fatigue theories to draw conclusions for long term loading in service. Aspects of the turbulent nature of the wind driving the wind turbine have been taken into consideration as being part of the aerodynamic loading onto the rotor and eventually the gearbox, transmitted through the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> The purpose of the test rig at this stage is to obtain a quantitative insight into the motion of the <b>main</b> <b>shaft.</b> The deliberately chosen softer aluminum material and the more slender geometry for the components should provide exaggerated displacements which help to make motion and deformations more obvious. At this point, no resemblance to real size wind turbines has been established...|$|R
