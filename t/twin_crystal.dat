50|$|If several <b>twin</b> <b>crystal</b> {{parts are}} aligned {{by the same}} twin law they are {{referred}} to as multiple or repeated twins. If these multiple twins are aligned in parallel they are called polysynthetic twins. When the multiple twins are not parallel they are cyclic twins. Albite, calcite, and pyrite often show polysynthetic twinning. Closely spaced polysynthetic twinning is often observed as striations or fine parallel lines on the crystal face. Rutile, aragonite, cerussite, and chrysoberyl often exhibit cyclic twinning, typically in a radiating pattern.But in general based on relationship between twin axis and twin plane there are 3 types of twinning exists, such as;1-parallel twinning:-when twin axis and compositional plane lies parallel to each other.2-normal twin:-when the twin plane and compositional plane lies noramally.3-complex twin:-combination of parallel twinning and normal twinning on one compositional plane.|$|E

The {{microstructure}} and {{the formation}} mechanism of martensite in W 6 Mo 5 Cr 4 V 2 steel was studied by metallographic microscope and JEM- 2100 transmission electron microscope after the samples were austenized between the temperatures of Ac 1 ~Accm and then quenched. The results show that When heating W 6 Mo 5 Cr 4 V 2 steel samples between the temperatures of Ac 1 ~Accm and then quenching, the cryptocrystalline martensite will be obtained. The cryptocrystalline martensite is plate martensite actually. It is considered that the formation cause of the cryptocrystal martensite is extremely inhomogeneous chemical composition in the austenite grains and the difference of martensite starting point (Ms point) of every small area in austenite grains. Besides the high-density dislocation and the fine <b>twin</b> <b>crystal,</b> the substructure of the cryptocrystalline martensite includes the superfine stacking fault.

40|$|The typical {{shapes of}} snow {{crystals}} of low temperature types {{that are known}} at present are "Gohei twins", "Sea gull", "Spearhead" and so on. Although they were named {{by one of the}} authors (K. K.) tentatively, these names appear to be accepted by scientists in the fields of cloud physics, crystal growth and so on. On the other hand, their formation mechanisms except for the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> have not been clarified. In this paper, the correlation between the gohei twin, sea gull, and spearhead type crystals has been considered based on a number of microphotographs taken by a polarizing microscope during the observation period from December 25, 1985 to January 23, 1986 at Inuvik (68 ° 22 ′N, 133 ° 42 ′W), N. W. T., Arctic Canada. As a result, although we have pointed out that the gohei <b>twin</b> type <b>crystals</b> are two kinds that have tip angles of 56 and 78 °, they have another difference besides the difference of their tip angles. Namely, the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> having the tip angle of 56 ° have a certain kind of finlike appendages along the crystalline boundary of two extended prism planes of the crystals. On the other hand, other <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> that have the tip angle of 78 ° are devoid of finlike appendages along the crystalline boundary. The angles of 13 and 20 ° between two extended prism planes of the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> pointed out in our previous papers were clarified by the measurement of the tip angles of individual extended prism planes. Furthermore, it was noted that the gohei <b>twin</b> <b>crystals</b> that have the tip angle of 56 ° are similar to the spearhead type crystals, and the spearhead type crystals were one of the wings of the sea gull type crystals seen from a right angle.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that the morphology of Au nanoparticles (NPs) affects the catalytic activity of CO oxidation; <b>twin</b> <b>crystal</b> NPs show higher activity for CO oxidation than single-crystal NPs. In this study, density functional calculations have been carried out to investigate the morphology effect of Au NPs using CO as a probe molecule. In the case of Au NPs with a size of more than 2 nm, CO adsorption energy on the Au NPs is mainly determined by a coordination number (CN) of adsorption sites. CO binding to a multiple twin NP with a size of about 1 nm is stronger than that on a single-crystal NP with the same size. A simple CN explanation cannot be applied to the enhancement of CO binding to the small multiple twin NP. This enhancement is related to a deformation of the NP structure before and after CO adsorption. It is suggested that the multiple twin NP with a size of less than 1 nm, which shows the deformation upon CO adsorption, contributes to the higher activity for CO oxidation...|$|E

Contrary to wild-type mice, fasting gallbladder volumes were enlarged and the response of gallbladder emptying to a high fat meal was impaired in knockout mice on chow or the lithogenic diet. In the lithogenic state, large amounts of mucin gel and liquid crystals as well as arc-like and tubular crystals formed first, followed by rapid formation of classic parallelogram-shaped cholesterol monohydrate crystals in knockout mice. Furthermore, three patterns of crystal growth habits were observed: proportional enlargement, spiral dislocation growth, and <b>twin</b> <b>crystal</b> growth, all enlarging solid cholesterol crystals. At day 15 on the lithogenic diet, 75 % of knockout mice formed gallstones. However, wildtype mice formed very little mucin gel, liquid and solid crystals, and gallstones were not observed.
