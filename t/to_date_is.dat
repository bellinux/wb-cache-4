5|$|Ampelosaurus sp. is a {{distinct}} sauropod {{as it is known}} from just a braincase. Although the number of sauropod braincases from the Late Cretaceous European archipelago found <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> limited, it shows a significant diversity. The specimen from Lo Hueco resembles the braincase of A. atacis MDE C3–761.|$|E
5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those maintaining that the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, {{she and her colleagues}} published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its extreme rarity in nature, most {{francium}} is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.|$|E

5|$|As {{at the end}} of the 2016–17 season, the club's {{first team}} had spent 101 seasons in the top {{division}} of English football, and 13 in the second. Their worst league finish <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> 10th in the second tier, their placing {{at the end of}} the 1896–97 season. Arsenal's best-ever start to a Premier League season came in 2007–08, when they won 11 of their first 14 matches. The club's longest period without a competitive honour is 31 years, between the 1889–90 and 1921–22 seasons. Ted Drake holds the record for most competitive goals in a single season for Arsenal; he scored 44 during the 1934–35 campaign. The table details the club's achievements in major competitions, and the top scorers for each season. Records of competitions such as the London Combination and the London War Cup are not included.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, Feeder {{have also}} gained a cult following, {{in which their}} last five studio albums have all charted in the top 100 between 2002 and 2012. Their most {{successful}} of these is 2008's Silent Cry charting at #53, although their most successful and only top 40 entry <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> their 2006 singles compilation, meaning the band have charted six albums regardless of format. In addition, much of their music has been featured in the Gran Turismo racing video game series, which is developed by the Japanese video game development studio Polyphony Digital.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> the quantitative EEG, which has documented an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E

Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, {{may have been a}} smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.|$|E
5|$|Wheel of Fortune {{is owned}} by Sony Pictures Television (previously known as Columbia TriStar Television, the {{successor}} company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises).

5|$|Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies (PML bodies) are spherical bodies found {{scattered}} throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1–1.0 µm. They are known {{by a number of}} other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. PML bodies belong to the nuclear matrix, an ill-defined super-structure of the nucleus proposed to anchor and regulate many nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, or epigenetic silencing. The PML protein is the key organizer of these domains that recruits an ever-growing number of proteins, whose only common known feature <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> their ability to be SUMOylated. Yet, pml-/- mice (which have their PML gene deleted) cannot assemble nuclear bodies, develop normally and live well, demonstrating that PML bodies are dispensable for most basic biological functions.|$|E

5|$|Since postseason games cannot {{end in a}} tie, {{unlike the}} preseason or regular season, {{additional}} overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined. Furthermore, all clock rules apply as if a game had started over. Therefore, if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied, the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime. If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime, {{there would be a}} two-minute warning (but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season). And if it were still tied at the end of double overtime, there would be a kickoff to start triple overtime. Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely, or last multiple overtime periods like several National Hockey League postseason games, no NFL playoff game has ever gone into triple-overtime. The longest NFL game played <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>is</b> 82 minutes, 40 seconds: Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of double-overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 27–24, in the 1971–72 NFL playoffs on December 25, 1971.|$|E
