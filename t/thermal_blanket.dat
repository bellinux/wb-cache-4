25|$|During the Mission Management Team briefing, LeRoy Cain {{noted that}} upon initial {{review of the}} ascent imagery, {{a small piece of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> {{appeared}} to come loose under the left Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pod, but explained that the area is not in an area of concern, as it does not experience high heat during reentry. During the Mission Status briefing, lead Flight Director Mike Sarafin said that after having the crew focus the camera on the left OMS pod, it did not appear that there was any damage, but the image analysis team would {{take a closer look at}} the area.|$|E
25|$|Discussions on {{providing}} a docking module for the Shuttle-Mir programme began in May 1993 and approval was granted on 1 November, with the draft plan {{being developed by}} December. The module consisted of what were essentially two Soyuz TM-16 type Soyuz orbital modules cut in half, with a cylindrical central portion mounted {{in the center of}} the two halves which incorporated docking apparatus (the other two halves were not used). An APAS-89 docking port was mounted on each end. Mounting points were also provided for two boxes (containing new solar arrays) and other external experiments, and the module was provided with its own thermal control, television transmission, and telemetry systems. Rather than being covered in a newly-manufactured white <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket,</b> the module was flown with an unusual orange blanket, which was selected from pre-existing stock for financial reasons. Development of the simplified module was given priority over the more complex Mir-2 type SO-1, and the flight model, the first to make use of NASA's new Space Station Processing Facility, was delivered to Kennedy Space Center on 7 June 1995 alongside the new solar arrays which were to be launched with it.|$|E
500|$|... carried two new {{instruments}} to the Hubble Space Telescope, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules {{to allow the}} telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. The crew also installed new <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection, and a soft-capture mechanism that would aid in the safe de-orbiting of the telescope by an unmanned spacecraft {{at the end of}} its operational lifespan. The mission also carried an IMAX camera with which the crew documented the progress of the mission for the Hubble IMAX movie.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} impacts from meteoroids and space debris {{particles}} {{to the various}} LDEF rows is calculated using ESABASE/DEBRIS, a 3 -D numerical analysis tool. It is based on recent reference environment flux models and includes geometrical and directional effects. A comparison of model predictions and actual observations is made for penetrations of the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> which covered the UHCR experiment. The <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> were located on all LDEF rows, except 3, 9, and 12. Because of their uniform composition and thickness, these blankets allow a direct analysis of the directional dependence of impacts and provide a test case for the latest meteoroid and debris flux models...|$|R
5000|$|Products {{manufactured}} include: dyed yarns, kitchen towels, napkins, tea towels, table cloths, terry towels, surgical towels, industrial towels, dishcloths, shower curtains, {{hospital bed}} sheets, <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets,</b> bedspreads, draw sheets, upholstery, handkerchiefs, aprons, place mats, pot holders, gloves, and beach throws.|$|R
2500|$|The covered biomes are {{constructed}} from a tubular steel (hex-tri-hex) with mostly hexagonal external cladding panels {{made from the}} thermoplastic ETFE. Glass was avoided due to its weight and potential dangers. The cladding panels themselves are created from several layers of thin UV-transparent ETFE film, which are sealed around their perimeter and inflated to create a large cushion. The resulting cushion acts as a <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> to the structure. The ETFE material is resistant to most stains, which simply wash off in the rain. If required, cleaning can be performed by abseilers. Although the ETFE is susceptible to punctures, these can be easily fixed with ETFE tape. The structure is completely self-supporting, with no internal supports, and {{takes the form of}} a geodesic structure. The panels vary in size up to [...] across, with the largest at the top of the structure.|$|E
50|$|A further {{in-flight}} repair {{was considered}} to remove or clip a damaged <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> located beneath the commander's window {{on the port side}} of the orbiter. Wind tunnel testing by NASA determined that the <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> was safe for re-entry, and plans for a fourth spacewalk were cancelled.|$|E

25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{is covered}} in gold-plated aluminium-tin alloy <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> to maintain a temperature of 10–20°C inside the spacecraft. The instruments that operate at low temperatures to be kept cold are thermally insulated from this relatively high internal temperature, and emit excess heat into space using attached radiators.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the risk}} {{assessment}} hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system. These fall into two categories: damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface, and damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) leading-edge panels. The TPS includes a third category of components, <b>thermal</b> insulating <b>blankets,</b> but damage predictions are not typically performed on them. Damage assessments on the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> can be performed after an anomaly has been observed, {{and this has been}} done at least once after the return to flight following Columbia's loss.|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{simulation}} tests (protons and electrons) were performed along with atomic oxygen flight tests aboard the Shuttle to space qualify the surface protective coatings. The results, which {{contributed to the}} selection of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated polyester as the material for the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> of the Galileo Spacecraft, are given here. Two candidate materials, polyester and Fluorglas, were radiation-tested to determine changes at simulated Jovian radiation levels. The polyester exhibited a smaller weight loss (2. 8) than the Fluorglas (8. 8 percent). Other changes of polyester are given. During low-earth orbit, prior to transit to Jupiter, the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> would be exposed to atomic oxygen. Samples of uncoated and ITO-coated polyesters were flown on the Shuttle. Qualitative results are given which indicated that the ITO coating protected the underlying polyester...|$|R
50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> is {{a device}} used in thermal {{desorption}} to clean soil contamination. The primary {{function of a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> is to heat the soil to the boiling point of the contaminants (usually 100 to 325 °C). The contaminants break down. A vacuum pulls the resulting gas (along with some contaminants) into a separate air cleaner that may use various methods, such as carbon filters and high-heat ovens, to completely destroy the contaminants.|$|E

5|$|Soyuz TM-9 {{launched}} EO-6 {{crew members}} Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr Balandin on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew noted that three <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, {{but it was}} decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board Mir saw the addition of the Kristall module, launched 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control thruster failure. Kristall arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite Kvant-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of Kristall, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module’s systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> on Soyuz TM-9.|$|R
50|$|Kapton is a {{polyimide}} film {{developed by}} DuPont {{in the late}} 1960s that remains stable across {{a wide range of}} temperatures, from −269 to +400 °C (−452 to 752 °F; 4-673 K). Kapton is used in, among other things, flexible printed circuits (flexible electronics) and <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> used on spacecraft, satellites, and various space instruments.|$|R
50|$|Before Kirchhoff's law was recognized, it {{had been}} {{experimentally}} established that a good absorber is a good emitter, and a poor absorber is a poor emitter. Naturally, a good reflector must be a poor absorber. This is why, for example, lightweight emergency <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> are based on reflective metallic coatings: they lose little heat by radiation.|$|R

50|$|The crew’s wakeup {{call came}} at 7:41 am CDT. Flight day 8 was {{dedicated}} to mission's third spacewalk (EVA 3) to repair the <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> on Atlantis and assist in folding up a solar array on the space station.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a concern}} that as a {{contaminant}} becomes heated, it may leak outside of {{the area of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket.</b> Therefore, the blanket must completely cover the contaminated area and have a strong enough vacuum to prohibit the spread of contaminations.|$|E

40|$|A {{responsibility}} of the group is to define the hypervelocity particle environment encountered by LDEF during its stay in low Earth orbit. LDEF's 6061 -T 6 aluminum frame and the 'Teflon silver-inconel paint' <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> represent large surface areas that were widely distributed around the spacecraft. The results are reported of high resolution scans of approx. 0. 36 and approx. 0. 31 sq m for the intercostals and <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets,</b> respectively. The findings are in qualitative agreement with existing model predictions that suggest high differential bombardment histories for surfaces pointing into specific directions relative to the velocity vector of a non-spinning platform in LEO. The production rate for craters greater than or = 50 microns in diameter in aluminum and penetration holes greater than or = 100 microns in diameter in thin foil materials differ {{by more than a}} factor of 10 between forward and rearward facing surfaces. These are substantial differences that must be considered during the design of future long duration space platforms in LEO...|$|R
25|$|During the free-flight phase, some shell heaters {{were more}} active than anticipated, {{but because the}} thermal and power {{situation}} remained acceptable, this {{did not affect the}} mission. Visual inspection from the space station later confirmed that some <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> had partially detached. Air trapped under the blankets during launch rapidly expanded as the ATV's altitude increased; more holes were added to future craft to fix this problem.|$|R
50|$|An object {{photographed in}} 1998 during the STS-88 mission {{has been widely}} {{claimed to be the}} Black Knight satellite. Space {{journalist}} James Oberg considers it probable that the photographs are of a <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> that was confirmed as lost during an EVA by Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman.|$|E
50|$|During the night, {{the crew}} {{reported}} a missing thermal tile {{around one of}} the overhead windows of the orbiter. The tile apparently came off recently since crew members look out the window often to perform the visual observations that accompany radar operations. Flight controllers report that, while the tile is missing, the underlying <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> is still intact.|$|E
50|$|As EVA 2 progressed, Mission {{managers}} {{approved a}} repair {{task for the}} damaged <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> {{to be carried out}} during the next spacewalk, EVA 3. Overnight the Russian flight controllers also worked to resolve the problem with the Russian segment computers. During the day, with the shuttle’s propulsion providing backup, the station’s control moment gyroscopes were handling attitude control.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> {{slow the}} rate of heat {{emission}} and camouflage nets use a mix of materials with differing thermal properties to operate in the infra-red as well as the visible spectrum. Camouflage attempts to break up the distinctive appearance and silhouette of a tank. Adopting a turret-down or hull-down position reduces the visible silhouette of a tank as well as providing the added protection of a position in defilade.|$|R
50|$|Material {{selection}} {{is a step}} in the process of designing any physical object. In the context of product design, the main goal of material {{selection is}} to minimize cost while meeting product performance goals. Systematic selection of the best material for a given application begins with properties and costs of candidate materials. For example, a <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> must have poor thermal conductivity in order to minimize heat transfer for a given temperature difference.|$|E
50|$|On 11 June 2007, NASA mission {{managers}} {{announced a}} two-day {{extension of the}} mission, adding a fourth extra-vehicular activity (EVA). These two days were inserted into the mission timeline after flight day 8. This possibility had been discussed prior to launch. Because of launch day and thus rendezvous day uncertainty the decision to extend was deferred until after launch. The repair of {{the gap in the}} Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> (heat shielding) was conducted during EVA 3.|$|E
50|$|Sweat {{is readily}} visualized by a topical {{indicator}} such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body’s {{response to a}} thermal stimulus by inducing sweating {{through the use of}} a hot box ⁄ room, <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis (see Minor test).|$|E
5000|$|Basic {{techniques}} for keeping newborns warm include keeping them dry, wrapping them in blankets, giving them hats and clothing, or increasing the ambient temperature. More advanced techniques include incubators (at 36.5 °C), humidity, heat shields, <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets,</b> double-walled incubators, and radiant warmers while {{the use of}} skin-to-skin [...] "kangaroo care" [...] interventions for low birth-weight infants have started to spread world-wide after its use as a solution in developing countries.|$|R
50|$|After launch, {{activation}} of the HIRDLS instrument revealed that the optical path was blocked so that 20% of the aperture could view the Earth's atmosphere. Engineering studies suggest that a piece of <b>thermal</b> <b>blanketing</b> material ruptured {{from the back of}} the instrument during the explosive decompression of launch. Attempts to remove this material mirror failed. However, even with the 80% blockage, measurements at high vertical resolution can be made at one scan angle.|$|R
