40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{there has been a}} {{convergence}} of two seemingly disparate fields of study: chromatin-dependent gene silencing and RNA turnover. In contrast to RNA <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that operate on a truly posttranscriptional level, we are at the beginning of studies leading the way toward a model in which RNA <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are also involved in chromatin-dependent gene regulation. In particular, data from a variety of organisms have shown that the assembly of silent chromatin coincides with {{the presence or absence of}} non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These range from long ncRNAs that have been classically implicated in the regulation of dosage compensation and genomic imprinting to small ncRNAs which are involved in heterochromatin assembly via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. This raises the question of how common ncRNAs are used to control gene expression at the level of chromatin. It is known at least, that they are present, as recent findings indicate that transcription of eukaryotic genomes is much more widespread than previously anticipated. However, the existence of a ncRNA does not prove its biological significance. Thus, a future challenge will be to distinguish the ncRNAs that are in some way meaningful to the organism from those that arise from the imperfect fidelity of the transcription machinery. Finally, no matter whether functional or not, RNAs transcribed from supposedly silent chromatin seem to be processed rapidly. Recent data from both fission and budding yeast suggest that chromatin-dependent gene silencing is achieved, at least in part, through RNA <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that use components of the RNAi pathway as well as polyadenylation-dependent RNA decay. Hence, silent chromatin is not only controlled transcriptionally, but also on co- and posttranscriptional levels...|$|R

40|$|The ubiquitin-proteasome {{system is}} a vital {{proteolytic}} pathway required for cell homeostasis. However, the <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the proteasome subunit itself is still not understood. Here, we show that the 20 S proteasome subunit PSMA 7 is subjected to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which was suppressed by PSMA 7 phosphorylation at Y 106 mediated by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases c-Abl/Arg. BRCA 1 specifically functions as an E 3 ubiquitin ligase of PSMA 7 ubiquitination. c-Abl/Arg regulates cellular proteasome abundance by controlling the PSMA 7 subunit supply. Downregulated PSMA 7 level results in decreased proteasome abundance in c-Abl/Arg RNAi-knockdown or c-abl/arg-deficient cells, which demonstrated an increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. In response to oxidative stress, the c-Abl-mediated upregulation of proteasome level compensates for the proteasomal activity impairment induced by reactive oxygen species. Abl-kinases-regulated biogenesis and homeostasis of proteasome complexes may be important for understanding related diseases and pathological states...|$|E

We show that a short-distance movement process, once initiated from {{a small group of}} cells, can spread over a limited and nearly constant number of cells, independent of the presence of homologous transcripts. There is also a long-range cell-to-cell movement process that occurs as a relay amplification, which requires the combined activity of SDE 1, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and SDE 3, a putative RNA helicase. Extensive and limited cell-to-cell movements of silencing are triggered by the same molecules, occur within the same tissues and likely recruit the same plasmodesmata channels. We propose that they are in fact manifestations of the same process, and that extensive cell-to-cell movement of RNA silencing results from re-iterated short-distance signalling events.

DNA units could also be clearly recognized despite a limited fragmentation; they segregated asymmetrically with respect to the nearest septum.

The Arabidopsis actin genes are widely dispersed on four different chromosomes (1, 2, 3, and 5). Even the members of three closely related and recently duplicated pairs of actin genes are unlinked. Several other cytoskeletal genes (profilins, tubulins) that might have evolved in concert with actins were also mapped, but showed few patterns consistent with that evolutionary history.

Protein turnover is an important metabolic and regulatory mechanism in establishing proteome homeostasis, impacting many physiological and pathological processes. Here, we have used organism-wide isotopic labeling to measure the turnover rates of ~ 2, 500 proteins in multiple mouse tissues, spanning four orders of magnitude. Through comparison of the brain with the liver and blood, we show that within the respective tissues, proteins performing similar functions often have similar turnover rates.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of theoretical works discussing the relationship between various human resource policies and employee retention. I build my models on a <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism</b> motivated by workers'private information about their feeling toward their current employer. Worker' use this private information s when deciding whether to continue working for that institution. This <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism</b> provides interesting insights into various employment and compensation practices. This dissertation discusses the interactions of turnover with pay systems, promotion and …rm sponsored training. The …rst chapter I discuss the role of formal pay systems within …rms. The role of rigid bureaucratic wage rules within organizations has been a puzzle for some time. This paper provides an explanation for the use of these formal pay systems using two intuitive yet somewhat novel labor market assumptions. First, turnover is induced through wages and private worker non pecuniary taste shocks. Second, wage o¤ers by current employers are a signal of worker ability. In this model, such asymmetry induces even higher turnover compared to full information over worker ability. This increased turnover reduces the expected welfare of the worker. I show how formal pay systems such as pay scales and budgets can mitigate this problem and reduce ine¢ cient turnover. I also provide testable predictions in order to distinguish the wage signaling model from the symmetric information model. In the second chapter, I build an in…nite-horizon turnover model to address the relationship between turnover, promotion and wages. Firms are deeply concerned with the costs of employee turnover. However, traditional labor economic theory is ill equipped to justify this concern. I explain how …rms capture rent from its continual relationships with an employee. Consistent with empirical studies, I …nd that an employee' turnover rate will decrease once promoted. This paper also s generates new empirical predictions as well as other well established wage and employee turnover dynamics. In the third chapter, I examine the role of employee bonding contracts on turnover e¢ ciency. Turnover is generated by realizations of a private taste shock observed by the worker after a period of work with the employee. These shocks allow the …rm to exercise a type of monopsonostic power over their current employees creating ine¢ ciently high turnover in equilibrium. I show that if done correctly, employee bonding contracts such as pension or minimum employment terms can reduce this ine¢ ciency. The bond must be written so that the manager setting the wage does not directly bene…t from the worker quitting. This separation of the wage setter and the bond holder is necessary to generate the required e¢ ciency improvements. A competitive labor market ensures that these e¢ ciency gains are ultimately realized by the worker. Workers prefer …rms that use devices to reduce turnover ine¢ ciencies.

ROS are involved in the classical D 1 <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism</b> of photoinhibition described above and have been invoked in other mechanisms of PSII inactivation in different systems (Aro et al. 2005; Keren and Krieger-Liszkay 2011). Recent work places a greater importance on the function of ROS on the rate of repair of PSII and also a more specific role of NPQ in this regard (Takahashi and Badger 2011). Regulation of ROS could prove important in the control of photoinhibition in the field. Important antioxidants include carotenoids, α-tocopherol, glutathione and ascorbate. Johnson et al. (2007) showed that zeaxanthin, in addition to a key role in qE formation, was able to reduce lipid peroxidation in plants and improve whole plant tolerance to high light and temperature stress. A similar observation also made in rice (Du et al. 2010). α-tocopherol has recently been shown to be an important component of photoprotection in rice (Chen et al. 2014). Transgenic overexpressors of antioxidants such as glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase (Foyer 1995), SOD (Kwon et al. 2002) and ascorbate peroxidase (Wang et al. 1999) have demonstrated the important role of radical scavenging.

Minisatellites are particularly informative, as shown by their early use in forensics and paternity testing in humans [7]. DNA typ-ing of minisatellites provides a powerful and highly discriminating tool. Unlike microsatellites that are comprised of short repeats (1 to 6 bp), minisatellites are intermingled arrays of usually GC-rich variant repeats ranging from [10, 100] bp and with array lengths in [0. 1, 20] kilobases. Intermingled patterns of variant repeats along the array can be charted by Minisatellite Variant Repeat mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR) to {{provide detailed information on}} internal allele structure [1]; see examples on Figure 1. Compared to human, the situation is more favourable in mouse for pedigree and geneal-ogy analysis. Systematic isolation has identified human-like minisatellite loci (i. e., GC-rich, highly polymorphic; [2]). However, none were found to be hypermutable.

A defining property of stem cells {{is that they are}} able to divide asymmetrically, but it is not known whether they always divide asymmetrically (immortal model) or whether there are occasional symmetrical divisions (stochastic model). By measuring diversity of methylation patterns in colon crypt samples, a recent study found evidence in favour of the stochastic model, assuming random segregation of stem cell DNA strands during cell division. Here, the effect of preferential segregation of the template strand is considered to be consistent with the 'immortal strand hypothesis', and explore the effect on conclusions of previously published results. Materials and methods: For a sample of crypts, it is shown how, under the immortal model, to calculate mean and variance of the number of unique methylation patterns allowing for non-random strand segregation and compare them with those observed.

40|$|In one of {{the first}} {{described}} examples of RNA silenc-ing there was coordinate suppression (cosuppression) of a transgene and an endogenous gene. Petunia plants with a flower pigment transgene (chalcone synthase [CS]) had white flowers because the transgene and the endogenous gene were silenced (Napoli et al. 1990; van der Krol et al. 1990). There was no reduction in the transcription of the endogenous gene and it seemed likely that an RNA <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism</b> was specifically targeted at CS RNA (van Blokland et al. 1994). In this and in other cosup-pression systems, the target RNA had a nucleotide se-quence that was identical to the transgene. When these findings were first described, it was not understood how such cosuppression could have such sequence specificity. However, based on discoveries in animal and plant sys-tems, it is now apparent that cosuppression is an RNA si-lencing process (Baulcombe 2004) in which RNA and DNA sequences are targeted specifically depending on the nucleotide sequence. The defining feature of RNA silencing is the involve-ment of long double-stranded (ds) RNA, which is pro-cessed by an RNAse III-type enzyme (Dicer) into short (21 – 25 -nucleotide) interfering (si) RNAs that initially ex-ist in a ds form with two nucleotide overhangs at the 3 ´ ends.

40|$|Autophagy {{serves as}} a <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the {{recycling}} of redundant and/or damaged macromolecules present in eukaryotic cells to re-use them under starvation conditions via a double-membrane structure known as autophagosome. A set of eukaryotic genes called autophagy-related genes (ATGs) orchestrate this highly elaborative process. The existence of these genes and the role they play in different eukaryotes are well-characterized. However, little is known of their role in some eukaryotes such as ciliates. Here, we report the computational analyses of ATG genes in five ciliate genomes to understand their diversity. Our results show that Oxytricha trifallax is the sole ciliate which has a conserved Atg 12 conjugation system (Atg 5 -Atg 12 -Atg 16). Interestingly, Oxytricha Atg 16 protein includes WD repeats {{in addition to its}} N-terminal Atg 16 domain {{as is the case in}} multicellular organisms. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses revealed that E 2 -like conjugating protein Atg 10 is only present in Tetrahymena thermophila. We fail to find critical autophagy components Atg 5, Atg 7 and Atg 8 in the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Contrary to previous reports, we also find that ciliate genomes do not encode typical Atg 1 since all the candidate sequences lack an Atg 1 -specific C-terminal domain which is essential for Atg 1 complex formation. Consistent with the absence of Atg 1, ciliates also lack other members of the Atg 1 complex. However, the presence of Atg 6 in all ciliates examined here may rise the possibility that autophagosome formation could be operated through Atg 6 in ciliates, since Atg 6 has been shown as an alternative autophagy inducer. In conclusion, our results highlight that Atg proteins are partially conserved in ciliates. This may provide a better understanding for the autophagic destruction of the parental macronucleus, a developmental process also known as programmed nuclear death in ciliates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are {{currently}} undergoing clinical evaluation as anti-cancer agents. Dietary constituents share certain properties of HDAC inhibitor drugs, including {{the ability to}} induce global histone acetylation, turn-on epigenetically-silenced genes, and trigger cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation in cancer cells. One such example is sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate derived from the glucosinolate precursor glucoraphanin, which is abundant in broccoli. Here, we examined the time-course and reversibility of SFN-induced HDAC changes in human colon cancer cells. Results Cells underwent progressive G 2 /M arrest over the period 6 - 72 h after SFN treatment, during which time HDAC activity increased in the vehicle-treated controls but not in SFN-treated cells. There was a time-dependent loss of class I and selected class II HDAC proteins, with HDAC 3 depletion detected ahead of other HDACs. Mechanism studies revealed no apparent effect of calpain, proteasome, protease or caspase inhibitors, but HDAC 3 was rescued by cycloheximide or actinomycin D treatment. Among the protein partners implicated in the HDAC 3 <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism,</b> silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) was phosphorylated in the nucleus within 6 h of SFN treatment, as was HDAC 3 itself. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed SFN-induced dissociation of HDAC 3 /SMRT complexes coinciding with increased binding of HDAC 3 to 14 - 3 - 3 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase 1 (Pin 1). Pin 1 knockdown blocked the SFN-induced loss of HDAC 3. Finally, SFN treatment for 6 or 24 h followed by SFN removal from the culture media led to complete recovery of HDAC activity and HDAC protein expression, during which time cells were released from G 2 /M arrest. Conclusion The current investigation supports a model in which protein kinase CK 2 phosphorylates SMRT and HDAC 3 in the nucleus, resulting in dissociation of the corepressor complex and enhanced binding of HDAC 3 to 14 - 3 - 3 or Pin 1. In the cytoplasm, release of HDAC 3 from 14 - 3 - 3 followed by nuclear import is postulated to compete with a Pin 1 pathway that directs HDAC 3 for degradation. The latter pathway predominates in colon cancer cells exposed continuously to SFN, whereas the former pathway {{is likely to be}} favored when SFN has been removed within 24 h, allowing recovery from cell cycle arrest. </p...|$|E

40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} disc is an age-related progressive process {{considered to be}} the major cause of a series of spine disorders, such as low-back pain that affects the majority of adult population and causes a huge loss of time from work and medical expenses. Numerous regenerative approaches are being developed with the aim to halt or reverse degeneration, including intradiscal administration of nucleus pulposus cells and mesenchymal stem cells and anabolic growth factors. Each of the currently proposed approaches, however, has exhibited certain limitations or shortcomings, largely due to our limited understanding on the cell biology, <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of the {{intervertebral disc}} as well as the etiology of disc degeneration. Intervertebral disc, particularly the central nucleus pulposus, is the largest enclosed and avascular tissue in the body and owes a microenvironment under high mechanical and osmotic pressures, at severely hypoxia, and with very limited nutrient supply. In order to achieve an optimal outcome of new regenerative therapies in such a harsh circumstance, identifying and characterizing endogenous regenerative properties of normal and degenerate intervertebral disc, including stem/progenitor cells themselves and extracellular factors located within the stem cell niche, may provide effective insights into selecting the most suitable cell sources and improving or rebuilding the microenvironment favorable for endogenous or transplanted stem cells. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} and intellectual capital have become critical components of wealth creation. "Knowledge {{has become the}} pre-eminent economic resource, more important than raw material, more important, often, than money. Considered as an economic output, information and knowledge {{are more important than}} automobiles, oil, steel or any of the products of the industrial era‖ (Stewart, 2002). As the "carrier" of the talent of organizations become more significant than ever. Those employees with higher organizational performance characteristics are often entitled "core" or "talent" for their key networking status in creating organizational intelligent capital values. They can also be in fierce competition with others in the market given the scarcity of vacancies. In the field of talent' retention/ turnover, the empirical study of social relation-oriented between talents' performance characteristics (KDS) and voluntary turnover (withdraw tendency) by modeling take the lead in highlighting talents‘ <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism.</b> And in recent years the newly-developed "job and community cross centrality" construct model from the retention scope has become a fresh focus and is referred to by the main stream for its advantages with stresses on the contemporary humanity merits canonized in knowledge era, more effective explanation and contributions to the traditional attitudinal turnover model from the platform of job satisfaction and organizational commitment only. This paper, with the background of modern social capital theory, begins from performance-decision issues, focuses on constructing the talents' organizational performance characteristics (KDS) and withdraw tendency model by introducing job coupling constructs and ways of combining literature methodology and empirical study. Significant results with cross-sectioned datum confirmatory analysis have been attained as follows: (1) Talents' performance measuring characteristics are operationally defined as the KDS with integration of seven dimensions based on organizational social capital theory. Its scale is developed with significant inner coherence and constructed to meet the demand of reliability and validity for anonymous questionnaires. (2) Allen‘s model (2001) is introduced with extended hypotheses showing advantages such as introduced job coupling constructs as mediated variables can helpfully disclose the path mechanism from talents' KDS to their job attitudes; KDS highlights the idiosyncrasy of talents' performance, which can usefully disclose relationships among variables in this model; and hypothetically extended moderators' effecting linkage can helpfully clear the relationship between performance visibility and talents' social networking, which previous research has lacked. (3) From the confirmatory study by LISREL on this paper's model, significant results and some new findings have been attained, both mediated path and moderated factors: job coupling constructs show dominant constraint over the path effects that seem to be the focus for talent retention; job payment is an essential retention factor at present for talents; off-the-job payment may become a compensation mechanism for talents who stay in some lower-pay organizations; family-responsibility of talents' are dual nature, both job family conflict and movement restraint; and talents' performance visibility may come true mainly through their social networking. (4) The difference analysis by SPSS on variables' effects from three groups, based on their nationality, job position or types and different scale of KDS, has given some cues. Talents as technicians or administrators are more homogeneous (lower substitutable and higher tendency to leave), and may be the main groups talents belong to; talents from the mainland of China may be of stronger turnover intent but are under more constraint from their job coupling; talents' withdraw tendencies have double- sided influence from their job coupling; the institutionalized retention and off-the-job professional growth motivation for talents may be the key issues for attaining higher job satisfaction, organizational commitment and effective retention results. (5) According to the theory of employees' decisions to participate, decision to perform and modern retention theories (March and Simon, 1958; Allen, 2001; Mitchell, 2004), an effective retention view [...] scoped model is developed based on which, both from the job but also from community coupling- oriented comprehensive retention suggestions are made. Finally, research works are summarized and some extending perspectives are put forward from some limitations of this paper...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{degradation}} is ubiquitous and it {{is clear}} that it must be carefully controlled to accurately recognise and target appropriate transcripts. There are several pathways for mRNA degradation and decapping is one of the critical steps in determining transcript stability. The focus of this study was the identification and characterisation of factors involved in decapping and their involvement in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in Aspergillus nidulans. Our studies have shown that disruption of two decapping factors, Dcp 1 and the Nudix protein Dcp 2, lead only to partial suppression of NMD. This distinguishes A. nidulans from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the two decapping factors are required for NMD. Deletion of lsm 1, which encodes a component of a heptomeric complex, Lsm 1 - 7, a known promoter of decapping, also partially supressed NMD. To our knowledge {{this is the first time}} that the role of Lsm’s in NMD has been described. A similar result was observed when another Nudix family protein, NdxD, was disrupted. We propose that NdxD is a second decapping factor in A. nidulans. Disruption of other factors known to promote decapping and subsequent RNA degradation, Pat 1, Dhh 1 and Xrn 1, did not affect NMD, demonstrating these factors are not required for NMD in A. nidulans. In order to quantify decapping, we set out to establish a simple and reliable assay to quantify the decapped transcripts. The method utilised splinted-ligation through which an RNA adaptor is ligated specifically to the 5 ’ end of decapped transcripts with the help of splint primer. The primer has a complementary sequences to the RNA adaptor at its 3 ’ end and the eight random nucleotides at the 5 ’ end to facilitate hybridisation to any decapped transcript. qRT-PCR was utilised to amplify the ligation products for a specific transcript and used internal primers as a control to assess the relative level of decapped transcripts. This gave a good basis for quantifying the decapped transcripts, however further optimisation is required in order to develop a robust assay. Although it has been known that both Dcp 1 and Dcp 2 form a decapping complex in yeast, our studies showed that Dcp 2 has a significant role in stabilising the uaZ+ transcript, while deletion of dcp 1 did not. Fluorescence microscopy has shown that both of these proteins localise primarily to the expected P-body like structures, however, the major proportions of Dcp 2 and Dcp 1 did not co-localise and were therefore not interacting. These data suggest that the Dcp 2 activity is not solely dependent on Dcp 1, suggesting a divergence between A. nidulans and S. cerevisiae. Additionally, confocal microscopy was used to characterise the intracellular distribution of CutA and CutB, which are involved in 3 ’ pyrimidine-tagging of transcripts, promoting decapping and degradation of mRNA. Using GFP and RFP tagged proteins, we determined that CutA is primarily localised in the cytoplasm whereas CutB is primarily, but not exclusively, located in the nuclei. Interestingly deletion of cutB lead to increased levels of CutA in the nuclei suggesting an interplay between the two proteins. Deletion of dcp 1 produces an aberrant polysome profile as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The predominant peak correlated with the large (60 S) subunit rather than the monosome (80 S) peak observed for WT. The small (40 S) subunit was also relatively high. These observations distinguished ∆dcp 1 from WT and the phenotype of the ∆dcp 2 strain was intermediate between the two. The accumulation of 60 S peak in ∆dcp 1 included a relatively high proportion of 28 S rRNA derived fragments. Northern analysis of these putative 60 S degradation products and sequencing of two specific fragments suggest that in the ∆dcp 1 strain the ribosomes are being cleaved, possibly as part of an rRNA <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Although genetic analysis showed that both ∆dcp 2 and a point mutation, dcp 2 E 148 Q, which is likely to disrupt the nuclease activity, are both epistatic to dcp 1 with respect to this phenotype. Northern analysis indicates that the degradation products observed in ∆dcp 1, ∆dcp 2 and WT strains appear very similar, even though the levels vary dramatically. This implies that Dcp 2 is probably not directly responsible for these cleavage events or it is one of a number of activities cleaving the rRNA in what appears to be a similar way...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we study}} the {{occurrence}} of abnormalities on bone tissue composition and <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanisms</b> through the Pb-mediated disruption of vitamins A and D in wild ungulates living in a lead (Pb) -polluted mining area. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) from the mining area had significantly higher liver and bone Pb levels than controls, which {{were associated with the}} depletion of liver retinyl esters and the corresponding increase of free retinol levels both in deer and boar from the mining area. Pb-exposed adult deer had lower carbonate content in bone mineral than controls, which was associated with the increased free retinol percentage. In wild boar, the degree of bone mineralization was also positively associated with higher burdens of retinyl esters. These results suggest that Pb-associated changes in bone composition and mineralization is likely influenced by the depletion of vitamin A in wildlife exposed to environmental Pb pollution.

40|$|Assuming that {{patterns}} of sequence variants within highly homogeneous centromeric tandem repeat arrays {{can tell us}} which molecular <b>turnover</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are presently at work, we analyzed the �-satellite tandem repeat array DXZ 1 of one human X chromosome. Here we present accurate snapshots from this dark matter of the genome. We demonstrate stable and representative cloning of the array in a P 1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library, use samples of higher-order repeats subcloned from five unmapped PACs (120 – 160 kb) to identify common variants, and show that such variants are presently in a fixed transition state. To characterize {{patterns of}} variant spread throughout homogeneous array segments, we use a novel partial restriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis mapping approach. We find an older large-scale (35 – 50 kb) duplication event supporting the evolutionarily important unequal crossing-over hypothesis, but generally find independent variant occurrence and a paucity of potential de novo mutations within segments of highest homogeneity (99. 1 %– 99. 3 %). Within such segments, a highly nonrandom variant clustering within adjacent higher-order repeats {{was found in the}} absence of haplotypic repeats. Such variant clusters are hardly explained by interchromosomal, fixation-driving mechanisms and likely reflect a fast, localized, intrachromosomal sequence conversion mechanism.
