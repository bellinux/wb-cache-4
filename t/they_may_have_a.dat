5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{children}} {{suffer from}} {{the same types of}} headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different. The diagnostic approach to headache in children {{is similar to that of}} adults. However, young children may not be able to verbalize pain well.

25|$|Impressive {{groves of}} {{turpentine}} (Syncarpia glomulifera) and blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) trees {{may be seen}} growing straight {{up into the sky}} forming an open canopy with widely spaced trunks. In these characteristic areas they are generally considered open forest, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> grassy understory, a sclerophyll shrubbery or alternatively <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rainforest subcanopy or a rainforest understory with growth being densest nearest to the valley floor or permanent watercourses. In these turpentine forests often hundreds of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) may be seen growing in dense tall thickets which are rarely touched by fire or they may exist as young plants in open grassy spaces which are burnt regularly enough not to form visible trunks. Rainforest pockets are dominated by jackwood and sassafras. The lilli pilli (Acmena smithii) produces a fruit edible raw. Another common species is the coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum) which were used extensively from Australian rainforests to manufacture horse-drawn coaches.|$|E

25|$|MIDI terminals: Most {{keyboards}} usually incorporate MIDI {{connection for}} data communication, typically connected {{with either a}} computer or another electronic musical instrument, such as a synthesizer, a drum machine or a sound module, allowing it {{to be used as}} a MIDI controller. Not all keyboards have conventional MIDI terminals and connector, but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> USB instead, which serve as both input and output in a single connection.

25|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may {{be helped by}} balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, {{or the use of}} assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence.|$|E
25|$|The caves are {{examples}} of rock-cut architecture, but unlike Longmen Grottoes and Yungang Grottoes, the local rock is a rather soft gravel conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details. Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut chaitya styles seen {{in places such as}} the Ajanta Caves in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the stupa round which worshippers may circumambulate (parikrama) and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian vihara (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.|$|E
500|$|Biller {{incorporated}} the Vidiians into the episode, believing that their technology would present a conceivable {{method by which}} Torres could be separated. The Vidiians were featured in an earlier season one episode titled [...] "". Biller explained that Klingons were shown to be more resistant [...] to disease than other species in previous Star Trek installments, and reasoned that a Vidiians scientist would view them as a promising way to discover a cure for the disease. Biller {{said that he had}} difficulty writing Sulan as a sympathetic villain. He looked to Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying antagonists in the Star Trek franchise: [...] "liens should never be patently evil. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> set of values that differ from our own, but be careful of making them mustache-twirling villains." ...|$|E

500|$|The word [...] "silver" [...] {{appears in}} Anglo-Saxon in various spellings, such as seolfor and siolfor. A similar form is seen {{throughout}} the Germanic languages (compare Old High German silabar and silbir). The chemical symbol Ag {{is from the}} Latin word for [...] "silver", argentum (compare Ancient Greek ἄργυρος, árgyros), from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₂erǵ- (formerly reconstructed as *arǵ-), meaning [...] "white" [...] or [...] "shining": this was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and Balto-Slavic. The Balto-Slavic words for silver are quite similar to the Germanic ones (e.g. Russian серебро , Polish srebro, Lithuanian sidabras) and <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common origin, although this is uncertain: some scholars have suggested the Akkadian sarpu [...] "refined silver" [...] as this origin, related to the word sarapu [...] "to refine or smelt".|$|E
500|$|On {{the campus}} of the University of Chicago in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of {{physicists}} led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore's Nuclear Energy was unveiled on the site of what was once the university's football field stands, in the rackets court beneath which the experiments had taken place. This 12-foot-tall piece {{in the middle of a}} large, open plaza is often thought to represent a mushroom cloud topped by a massive human skull, but Moore's interpretation was very different. He once told a friend that he hoped viewers would [...] "go around it, looking out through the open spaces, and that <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> feeling of being in a cathedral." [...] In Chicago, Illinois, Moore also commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named Man Enters the Cosmos (1980), which was commissioned to recognise the space exploration program.|$|E
