5|$|Moe {{speaks to}} Homer {{through the bars}} of his jail cell window and {{promises}} to bail him out, but changes his mind when Renee talks about wanting <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> in Hawaii. While packing for the trip, Moe is confronted by his own conscience, {{in the form of}} Homer, who makes him feel bad for his betrayal. Moe ends up telling Renee the truth about the insurance fraud scheme, and she is at first happy he was honest. However, when Moe starts scheming again for a way to get Homer out of jail without paying the bail, Renee is disgusted and leaves him.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the United States {{because of her}} {{criminal}} record. According to a letter from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning, she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada. Manning told Reuters that she had planned <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E

5|$|Saving Mr. Banks depicts several {{events that}} differ from {{recorded}} accounts. The premise of the script—that Walt Disney had to convince P.L. Travers {{to hand over the}} film rights, including the scene when he finally persuades her—is fictionalized, as Disney had already secured the film rights (subject to Travers' approval of the script) when Travers arrived to consult with the Disney staff. Disney, in fact, left Burbank <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> in Palm Springs a few days into Travers' visit and was not present at the studio when several of the film's scenes depicting him to be present actually took place. Therefore, many of the dialogue scenes between Travers and Disney are adapted from letters, telegrams, and telephone correspondence between the two. Although Travers was assigned a limousine driver, the character of Ralph is fictionalized and intended to be an amalgamation of the studio's drivers. In real life, Disney story editor Bill Dover was assigned as Travers' guide and companion during her time in Los Angeles.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, two bodies of {{literature}} have developed relatively independently: Quality of Life research in Psychology and Travel Motivations research in Tourism. Yet, the constructs underlying these two bodies of research are strongly interrelated. This book chapter: (1) reviews the Quality of Life research area with a specific focus {{on the role of}} vacations as a Quality of Life domain; (2) reviews prior work in the area of Travel Motivations with a specific focus on motivational segments which may be associated with differences in the importance people attribute <b>to</b> <b>vacations</b> in general; and (3) proposes a conceptual model, referred to as the Grevillea Model, that integrates heterogeneity in the population with respect to both the importance attributed <b>to</b> <b>vacations</b> and Travel Motivations...|$|R

The entire trip cost about 6.3 million TWD with a total of 35 people, which was paid by Show.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>vacations</b> <b>to</b> people’s life satisfaction and Quality of Life (QOL) has recently attracted substantial attention among tourism researchers. Yet, most QOL scales {{do not include}} vacations: 7 % explicitly measure vacations whereas 42 % only include items relating <b>to</b> <b>vacations</b> within the broader Leisure domain. Leisure and vacations, however, differ substantially in nature with leisure referring to regular home-based activities and vacations being infrequent leisure activities away from home. As {{a consequence of the}} common amalgamation of vacations with leisure, there is limited knowledge about the specific {{contribution of}} <b>vacations</b> <b>to</b> people’s QOL. The present study (1) presents empirical evidence for the contribution of <b>vacations</b> <b>to</b> QOL, (2) determines the extent of this contribution, and (3) investigates variation in the extent <b>to</b> which <b>vacations</b> contribute <b>to</b> the QOL of different people. Results indicate that <b>vacations</b> contribute <b>to</b> the QOL of the majority of people, are as important a QOL domain as Leisure and People, and that QOL means different things to different people at different points in their life, representing an individual and dynamic concept...|$|R

25|$|Many of Lake Minnetonka's {{visitors}} began {{finding new}} places <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> as the railroads expanded westward in the 1890s, causing {{most of the}} lake's hotels and steamboats to suffer financially and cease operations. Some hotels burned during this time, but most were demolished or dismantled. By 1900, however, {{an increasing number of}} families had begun to construct private summer cottages around Lake Minnetonka. Permanent homes and grand estates also began to appear around the lake as the Twin Cities metropolitan area grew. Some of these homes and cottages still exist, including the Thompson Summer House in Minnetonka Beach.|$|E

Lee after the Civil War, that advocated the merging of the two societies. The resort went on to become a center of regional post-war society. Henry M.

25|$|Nevertheless, only a {{few months}} later, the enigmatic Howard Hughes first learned of the design and leased the Jetliner {{prototype}} for testing, flying it for a few circuits when it arrived in Culver City, California. He became a believer, imagining TWA and National delivering passengers from New York City <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> spots in Florida in half the time of the competition. He became desperate to buy 30 Jetliners, but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started looking at US companies to build it for them; Convair proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its Orenda turbojet and CF-100 jet fighter programs.|$|E
25|$|The Jews of Livingston Manor {{and their}} synagogue prospered during the Depression {{due to a}} summer influx of middle-class garment workers from the city. Newly unionized, the workers could afford summer {{vacations}} at Jewish mountain resorts. Among the Rabbis who served the congregation during this time were Rabbi Meir Bilitsky, ordained at Yeshiva Chaim Berlin, who began his rabbinical career in this synagogue, later moving to New Hyde Park, where he served as rabbi {{for the rest of}} his life. This increasing affluence turned against the Catskills in the 1950s. These same Jews and their descendants moved into suburban homes and began <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> elsewhere, including those resorts that had once been closed to them. Jews began to leave the village, and by 1972 Agudas Achim was open only during the High Holy Days and beginning to deteriorate.|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{grew up in}} {{a two-story}} {{bungalow}} on Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area.

[...] Her elementary school was down the street. They enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides. She played piano, learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher. The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.

500|$|To {{capitalize}} on {{the opening of the}} Mackinac Bridge in 1957, local leaders in Battle Creek wanted to promote M-66 as a route north from Indiana to the bridge. They named the highway the Green Arrow Route as part of this marketing strategy. The color was to evoke the forests in the area, and arrow was meant to play on several historical connections. One of these was the Pennsylvania Railroad's Northern Arrow passenger train that once operated in the area. The official explanation was to tie into the history of Native Americans in the area, but the route was also [...] "straight as an arrow". The backers also promoted the highway as a direct and scenic route <b>to</b> <b>vacation</b> country in the northern Lower Peninsula, avoiding most of the larger cities in the area. [...] M-66 was given the Green Arrow Route name in Public Act170 of 1959 between the Indiana state line and Kalkaska. Despite these efforts, M-66 failed to attract much traffic. When the Michigan Legislature recodified the memorial highway names in Public Act142 of 2001, the Green Arrow Route was truncated to the northern border of Calhoun County, a change confirmed by Public Act138 of 2004.|$|E
