25|$|<b>The</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the 50kroner notes {{has become}} so harsh in recent years, {{possibly}} from people not regarding them as very valuable any more, so that their maintenance cost is becoming {{a problem for the}} Bank of Norway. The 50kroner note may well be replaced by a 50kroner coin in the not too distant future.|$|E

25|$|Now a rocky tidal island, the Mont {{occupied}} {{dry land}} in prehistoric times. As sea levels rose, erosion reshaped the coastal landscape, and several outcrops of granite {{emerged in the}} bay, having resisted <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of the ocean better than the surrounding rocks. These included Lillemer, the Mont-Dol, Tombelaine (the island just to the north), and Mont Tombe, later called Mont Saint-Michel.|$|E
25|$|At {{a cost of}} $197 million, new {{parallel}} two-lane trestles {{were built}} both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel trestles, traffic was diverted to them and the original trestles and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as repaving the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.|$|E
25|$|Slowly however, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> {{of years}} of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after {{the defeat of the}} leftist guerrillas, plus the {{inability}} to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure, made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Geisel and Golbery. With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began its slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Tests were perfomed on <b>the</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tearing</b> of {{double-edged}} rectangular punches {{and on the}} shearing of 0. 25 mm thick Kovar sheets {{by using}} the punches. Ten rectangular punches with the slenderness ratio ranging from 8. 7 to 80. 7 were used in <b>the</b> experiment. <b>The</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tearing</b> of <b>the</b> cutting edges and the bending and breakage of the punches were examined. The unbalanced side shearing force which produced local abnormal <b>wears,</b> breakages, <b>and</b> other defects of the punches and their edges maight {{have been caused by}} scraps remaining on the die face, <b>the</b> uneven <b>wears</b> on <b>the</b> cutting edges, and the local uneveness in tool clearance and work material. Such abnormal <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> breakage can be prevented by making a smaller clearance between the blank holder and the punch than that of the clearance between the punch and die. By observing the defective edges of the punches and the dies using an X-ray microanalyser, it has been made clear that particles of the work material have adhered to the side suface of the tools. From this observation it can be conclude that <b>the</b> tool <b>wear</b> in this case belongs to <b>the</b> adhesive <b>wear...</b>|$|R

25|$|In tennis, {{grass is}} grown on very hard-packed soil, and the bounce of {{a tennis ball}} may vary {{depending}} on the grass's health, how recently it has been mowed, and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of recent play. The surface is softer than hard courts and clay (other tennis surfaces), so the ball bounces lower, and players must reach the ball faster resulting in a different style of play which may suit some players more than others. Among the world's most prestigious court for grass tennis is Centre Court at Wimbledon, London which hosts the final of the annual Wimbledon Championships in England, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments.|$|E
25|$|Contact lenses {{are often}} {{categorized}} by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because {{they do not}} have to stand up to <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008 the South African {{government}} {{announced that it}} would introduce electricity rationing. On 25 January 2008 the country's deepening power crisis was such that South Africa's (and the world's) largest gold and platinum mining companies were forced to shut down operations. Eskom (the national power supplier) and the government both apologised for the blackouts and in his next-to-last State of the Nation speech Mbeki devoted nearly three pages to the electricity crisis, repeating the apologies of Eskom and the government. Mbeki blamed the power shortages on increased demand caused by years of economic growth and the provision of electricity to black townships that were not connected in the apartheid era. But Mbeki also admitted the government had failed to heed warnings from Eskom (the earliest 10 years previously) that without new power stations Eskom {{might not be able to}} meet demand by 2007. Each year over the preceding 10 years, Eskom had produced annual Integrated Strategic Electricity Plans each setting out scenarios of future investment requirements to cope with projected increased demand, but although projections of average demand growth in the period 2001–2005 had been accurate, no investment had been forthcoming. Mbeki failed to respond to allegations that the government's black empowerment strategy had been a root cause of the problem in that small and medium sized black entrepreneurs, in preference to large corporations, had been awarded coal supply tenders. The policy of giving preference to small suppliers had caused problems in securing reliable supplies of coal, and had also, because small suppliers did not have the capital to invest in rail or conveyor belts infrastructure but used coal trucks, accelerated <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> damage to the roads around the power stations. Warnings highlighted in several of Eskom's annual reports, starting in 2003, had been ignored not only by the Eskom board but also its political masters, Mbeki's government.|$|E

500|$|On July 20, {{the fabric}} began being formed around the {{aluminum}} shell while it {{remained in the}} tent, and although construction {{was expected to be}} completed on August 1, the opening was not anticipated at that time due to both weekend crowds and the cost of disassembling the tent on the weekend. [...] The weekday opening should allow officials a better opportunity to gauge <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the structure by visitors. What eventually amounted to over [...] of fabric was stitched and fitted by over a dozen workers. [...] It opened to the public on August 4 as rescheduled. Upon the completion of the temporary exhibition, the pavilion will be deeded to the city to lend or rent out to other cities. It is not designed to withstand snow loads of a Chicago winter. [...] The pavilion is made of aluminum, donated by Marmon/Keystone Industries, a member of the Marmon Group, and a tensile fabric.|$|E
500|$|After Phips {{returned}} to London in August 1685, Samuel Pepys ordered the Navy Board {{to assess the}} Rose. Pepys {{had been out of}} power when Narborough set the strange plan in motion. In March and May 1686, Phips was ordered to attend the Lord Treasurer where {{it was found that the}} King was only to receive £471 in treasure, though <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the Rose was estimated at £700. [...] In this age of piracy and high mortality, Phips making it back to London alive and with the King's ship still afloat was probably enough for him to pass the test. Already Narborough had a new plan in the works for Captain Phips, though this time it would be a private venture. Narborough's long infatuation with the Hispaniola treasure had not been diminished by Captain Stanley's discouragement on the Bonetta. And Knepp's report on Phips did not disqualify him. Phips had shown that he was serviceable: willing to harass the harbor of his hometown and to compromise between his own interests, and the interests of the crown. This was surely noted at Whitehall, even by the more conservative elements.|$|E

Again, he anticipated that once the adjustments were complete, he would return to his previous form. Woods changed coaches, working with Hank Haney after leaving Harmon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exterior}} of the theatre is meant to resemble a giant, red Chinese pagoda. [...] The design features a huge Chinese dragon across the façade, with two authentic Ming Dynasty guardian lions ("heavenly dogs") guarding the main entrance and the silhouettes of tiny dragons {{along the sides of}} the copper roof. To the dismay of many historic architecture fans, the free-standing ticket booth, installed in the 1930s, and the left and right neon marquees have been removed—but their absence restores the theatre to its original appearance. The auditorium has been completely restored, along with much of the exterior; however, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the physical structure over the years has caused some of the external décor to be removed, rather than repaired.|$|E
2500|$|... "One of the {{greatest}} calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were {{in a state of}} disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey {{at one time or another}} to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration." ...|$|E
