Little is known about their first {{meetings}} in 1898, except that <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> understood each other’s language. They married against Oskar's mother's wishes in 1899. The Vogt couple collaborated on their research for sixty years, usually with Cécile as the primary author. The Vogts had two daughters, both accomplished scientists in their own rights.|$|E
25|$|Coracles can be {{effective}} fishing vessels. When operated skilfully, <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> disturb the water or the fish. Welsh coracle fishing is performed by two men, each seated in his coracle and with one hand holding the net while with the other he plies his paddle. When a fish is caught, each hauls up {{his end of the}} net until the two coracles touch and the fish are secured. Many coracles are so light and portable that they can easily be carried on the fisherman's shoulders.|$|E

These panels and {{numerous}} windows cover most of the outside perimeter of the cabins. From the 1960s through 1980s, <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> seemed necessary, for the hemlock trees formed a thick canopy and kept the shaded grounds cool. However, in the early 1990s, the hemlock woolly adelgid began destroying the hemlock trees, so the surrounding forest is again scattered with dead and fallen trees as in Hoover's day.|$|E
25|$|Julius Obsequens was a Roman {{writer who}} is {{believed}} to have lived {{in the middle of the}} fourth century AD. The only work associated with his name is the Liber de prodigiis (Book of Prodigies), completely extracted from an epitome, or abridgment, written by Livy; De prodigiis was constructed as an account of the wonders and portents that occurred in Rome between 249 BC-12 BC. An aspect of Obsequens' work that has inspired much interest in some circles is that references are made to things moving through the sky. These have been interpreted as reports of UFOs, but may just as well describe meteors, and, since Obsequens, probably, writes in the 4th century, that is, some 400 years after the events he describes, <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> qualify as eye-witness accounts.|$|E
25|$|Alex {{returns to}} the city alone and goes to Robert's house with the {{intention}} of killing him. Alex falls asleep in his car outside the house and is awoken by Robert who invites him in. As he retrieves the gun from the glove box, he discovers an envelope containing the results of Vera's pregnancy test and a letter written by Vera on the back. The film cuts to a flashback of the time Robert came to Alex's home while he was away. It is revealed that the day before, Vera attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills but is saved by Robert. The next day, Vera finds out she is pregnant and confides with Robert, revealing that she never had an affair and that the baby was in fact Alex's, even though she says it felt like it wasn't his as <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> ever talk. She expressed concerns about having another baby in this relationship that was lacking communication.|$|E

25|$|After the Japanese secured Singkawang on 29 December, {{the rest}} of the British and Dutch troops retreated further into the jungle, moving to the south to Sampit and Pangkalanbun, where a Dutch {{airfield}} was located at Kotawaringin. On 31 December, a force under Lieutenant Colonel Genzo Watanabe moved northward to occupy the remainder of Brunei, Beaufort and Jesselton. Jesselton was defended by the North Borneo Armed Constabulary with only 650 men. <b>They</b> <b>hardly</b> provided any resistance to slow down the Japanese invasion, and the town was taken on 9 January. On 3 January 1942, the IJA invaded Labuan Island. On 18 January, using small fishing boats, the Japanese landed at Sandakan, the seat of government of British North Borneo. On the morning of 19 January, Governor Charles Robert Smith surrendered British North Borneo and was interned with other staff. The occupation of British Borneo was thus completed. The Dutch southern and central Borneo were also taken by the IJN, following its attacks from east and west. After ten weeks in the jungle-covered mountains, Allied troops surrendered on 1 April.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, {{there was}} rising {{agitation}} in East Bengal against {{the omission of}} Bengali script from coins, stamps and government exams. Thousands of students, mainly from the University of Dhaka, protested in Dhaka and clashed with security forces. Prominent student leaders including Shamsul Huq, Khaleque Nawaz khan, Shawkat Ali, Kazi Golam Mahboob, Oli Ahad, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Abdul Wahed were arrested and the police were accused of excessive brutality while charging protesters. In March, senior Bengali political leaders were attacked whilst leading protests demanding that Bengali be declared an official language in Pakistan. The leaders included the A. K. Fazlul Huq, the former Prime Minister of undivided Bengal. Amidst the rising discontent in East Bengal, Jinnah visited Dhaka and announced that Urdu would be sole state language of Pakistan given its significance to Islamic nationalism in South Asia. The announcement caused uproar in East Bengal, where the native Bengali population resented Jinnah for his attempts to impose a language <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> understood. The resentment was further fuelled by rising discrimination against Bengalis in government, industry, bureaucracy and {{the armed forces and}} the dominance of the Muslim League. The Bengalis argued that they constituted the ethnic majority of Pakistan's population and Urdu was remote to the land of Bengal, located in the eastern Indian Subcontinent. Moreover, the rich literary heritage of the Bengali language and the deep rooted secular culture of Bengali society led to a strong sense of linguistic and cultural nationalism amongst the people of East Bengal. The only significant language in Pakistan not written in the Persian-Arabic script was Bengali. Against this backdrop, Bengali nationalism began to take root within the Muslim League and the party's Bengali members began to rebel.|$|E

500|$|On stage, Olivier and Leigh {{starred in}} Romeo and Juliet on Broadway. It was an extravagant production, but a {{commercial}} failure. In The New York Times Brooks Atkinson praised the scenery {{but not the}} acting: [...] "Although Miss Leigh and Mr Olivier are handsome young people <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> act their parts at all." [...] The couple had invested almost all their savings in the project, and its failure was a grave financial blow. They were married in August 1940, at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara.|$|E
500|$|Critics were hostile {{in their}} {{assessment}} of Romeo and Juliet. Brooks Atkinson for The New York Times wrote: [...] "Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people, <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> act their parts at all." [...] While {{most of the}} blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the [...] "thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice". The couple had invested almost all of their combined savings of $40,000 in the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Banks {{was named}} a Library of Congress Living Legend, a {{designation}} that recognizes those [...] "who have {{made significant contributions to}} America's diverse cultural, scientific and social heritage". In 2013, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom with 15 other people, including Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. During the ceremony, he presented President Obama with a bat that had belonged to Jackie Robinson. Banks remained close to the Cubs team and made frequent appearances at their spring training grounds, HoHoKam Stadium in Arizona. Author Harry Strong wrote in 2013 that [...] "the Chicago Cubs do not have a mascot, but <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> need one when the face of the franchise is still so visible".|$|E

500|$|Salinger also {{insisted that}} Claire {{drop out of}} school and live with him, only four months shy of graduation, which she did. Certain {{elements}} of the story [...] "Franny", published in January 1955, are based on his relationship with Claire, including her ownership of the book The Way of the Pilgrim. Because of their isolated location and Salinger's proclivities, <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> saw other people for long stretches of time. Claire was also frustrated by Salinger's ever-changing religious beliefs. Though she committed herself to Kriya yoga, she remembered that Salinger would chronically leave Cornish to work on a story [...] "for several weeks only to return with the piece {{he was supposed to be}} finishing all undone or destroyed and some new 'ism' we had to follow." [...] Claire believed [...] "it was to cover the fact that Jerry had just destroyed or junked or couldn't face the quality of, or couldn't face publishing, what he had created." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 2008, the five-term Republican Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter made clear {{his plans to}} seek re-election. Specter had {{narrowly}} avoided a primary defeat against conservative challenger Pat Toomey during his 2004 Senate race, and {{he was expected to}} face an even greater challenge from Toomey in 2010, particularly since the conservative faction of the Pennsylvania Republican Party had vowed to defeat Specter in the upcoming primary. Some high-profile Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden and Governor Rendell, began encouraging Specter to join the Democratic Party by publicly offering to help Specter raise money if he switched. A March 2009 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll found Specter trailing Toomey 41 percent to 27 percent among Republican primary voters, in large part due to voter angst over Specter's support for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was supported by President Obama. Since the Pennsylvania primaries are closed, the poll noted that Specter could not be assisted by support from moderates or Democrats. Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said of the poll results, [...] "Pennsylvania Republicans are so unhappy with Sen. Specter’s vote for President Barack Obama's Stimulus Package and so-called pork barrel spending that they are voting for a former Congressman <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> know." ...|$|E

500|$|Like Khánh, Harkins {{was not on}} {{good terms}} with the junta. With respect to the {{overthrow}} of Diệm, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and elements in the US State Department {{were in favor of}} regime change, while the US military leadership supported Diệm's retention. It was well known to Minh and his close supporters that Harkins had strongly opposed the coup and tried to stop it. As a result, they distrusted him as a [...] "symbol of the old order" [...] and did not [...] "look for advice" [...] from Pentagon officials. Lacking influence on the new government, Harkins fell significantly behind Lodge as the leading American in Saigon. According to Kahin, the two were never close and [...] "if prior to the ouster of Diệm they appeared to be estranged team members, thereafter <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> seemed {{to be on the same}} team." [...] In a report to US President Lyndon Baines Johnson in December 1963, McNamara claimed that [...] "The Country Team is the second major weakness [...] It lacks leadership and is not working to a common plan...Above all Lodge has virtually no official contact with Harkins. Lodge sends in reports with major military implications without showing them to Harkins." ...|$|E
500|$|Most {{rorquals}} mate in warm {{waters in}} winter {{to give birth}} almost a year later. A 7-to-11 month lactation period is normally followed by a year of rest before mating starts again. Adults normally start reproducing when 5–10 years old and reach their full length after 20–30 years. In the smallest rorqual, the minke whale, [...] calves are born after a 10-month pregnancy and weaning lasts until it has reached about [...] after 6–7 months. Unusual for a baleen whale, female minkes (and humpbacks) can become pregnant immediately after giving birth; in most species, there is a two-to-three-year calving period. In right whales, the calving interval is usually three years. They grow very rapidly during their first year, after which <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> increase in size for several years. [...] They reach sexual maturity when [...] long. Baleen whales are K-strategists, meaning they raise one calf at a time, have a long life-expectancy, and a low infant mortality rate. Some 19th century harpoons found in harvested bowheads indicate this species can live more than 100 years. Baleen whales are promiscuous, with none showing pair bonds. They are polygynous, in that a male may mate {{with more than one}} female. The scars on male whales suggest they fight for the right to mate with females during breeding season, somewhat similar to lek mating.|$|E
500|$|Fundamental in {{this view}} of {{conscience}} is that humans consider some [...] "other" [...] as being in a social relationship. Thus, nationalism is invoked in conscience to quell tribal conflict {{and the notion of}} a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell national conflicts. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual conscience. Friedrich Nietzsche stated: [...] "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.' Jeremy Bentham noted that: [...] "fanaticism never sleeps... it is never stopped by conscience; for it has pressed conscience into its service." [...] Hannah Arendt in her study of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his conscience to the point where <b>they</b> <b>hardly</b> remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose conscience did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: [...] "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a [...] "respectable voice", with the voice of the respectable society around him".|$|E
