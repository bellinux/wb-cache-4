40|$|Solder joint {{reliability}} {{concerns are}} increasing exponentially with the continuous push for device miniaturization, and the expanded use in portable electronic products. In order {{to predict the}} solder joint reliability under drop conditions, {{it is important to}} increase the <b>testing</b> <b>speed</b> of package level test methods, such as high-speed solder ball shear and pull. Traditional ball shear and pull tests are not considered suitable for evaluation of joint reliability under drop loading, since the applied <b>test</b> <b>speeds,</b> usually lower than 5 mm/s, are well below the impact velocity applied to the solder joint in a drop test. Recently, high-speed shear and pull test equipment (Dage 4000 HS) with <b>testing</b> <b>speeds</b> beyond 1, 000 mm/s has become available. The present study continues the efforts reported recently and investigates the effect of thermal aging on the attachment strength and fracture energy of SnAgCu lead-free solder balls during high <b>speed</b> ball shear/pull <b>tests.</b> The ball shear <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 100 mm/s to 1, 000 mm/s, while the ball pull <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 5 mm/s to 100 mm/s. The test specimens were aged at 125 °C or 150 °C for durations of 100, 300 and 500 hrs, with some additional samples exposed up to 1, 000 hrs. Correlations were established between solder joint fracture force/energy and IMC thickness, and between fracture energy and failure mode. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} brittle solder joint failure mechanisms during high-speed solder ball shear and pull testing. BGA package samples with different solder alloys (Sn 4. 0 %Ag 0. 5 %Cu and Sn 37 %Pb) were fabricated {{and a series}} of solder ball shear and pull tests were conducted at various <b>testing</b> <b>speeds.</b> The ball shear <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 10 mm/s to 3000 mm/s, while the ball pull <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 5 mm/s to 500 mm/s. Following high-speed shear/pull testing, the brittle fracture surfaces of the solder balls and corresponding pad were inspected using SEM/EDX. The results describe an increased incidence of brittle interfacial fracture for SnAgCu solder compared to SnPb solder. Microstructure analysis of brittle solder joint fracture surfaces appears an effective method to aid correlation between board level drop test and high-speed solder ball shear/pull tests...|$|R

The intention was that the <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> would later be increased to 60 km/h. This was at a European Parliament Inter-group meeting, with Max Mosley of the Federation Internationale de L’Automobile (FIA) as chairman. Industry was there to oppose - their concern was that cars could not be built to withstand the speeds proposed. Yet Max Mosley, profoundly moved by the recent death of Ayrton Senna on the race track, developed an increased interest in reducing the road accident injury toll. The death of a racing driver had spurred on the cause to improve car safety for the public and to prevent millions of deaths on European roads.|$|E
