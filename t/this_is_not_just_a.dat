Authorizing indefinite detention of anybody the Government designates, without any proceeding and without any recourse—is what our worst critics claim the United States would do, not what American values, traditions and our rule of law would have us do. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> bad bill, this is a dangerous bill.|$|E
25|$|Between the seventeenth-century and {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that {{had the effect of}} concentrating the light. This new type of lamp lit up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light to dazzle the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals.|$|E

But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> 'pop album,' it's a woman holding forth on {{the role of women in}} our society, how they should approach the nuances of their life and most importantly, how they can choose to value relationships...

500|$|The {{song was}} met with a polarised {{response}} from critics. PopMatters felt that the song [...] "comes close to sounding too safe, almost like the band is on autopilot." [...] Several critics felt that the song resembled Coldplay's earlier single [...] "Clocks". MusicOMH commented that [...] "Speed Of Sound, the lead single, has 'Clocks'-like drumming contrasts with synth sequences that remind more of Enya than rock music" [...] and criticised it for sounding [...] "familiar and far older than it is." [...] Pitchfork Media likewise criticised the song's [...] "uncanny resemblance to 'Clocks'" [...] and continued [...] "Certainly, it rarely hurts to stick with what works, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it." [...] The reviewer did, however, comment that [...] "the track's vocal melody outperforms the one from 'Clocks' by a hair." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{suspected}} case in Asia was in 1997, {{though it was}} not until the fifth {{suspected case}} that the presence of the virus could be confirmed. This case was reported in 2006, with the death of a young wild-born female calf at an elephant sanctuary in Cambodia. The virus was identified as part of the EEHV1 group, the same as previously identified in the North American and European captive populations. In 2013, nine lethal cases from India were extensively characterized and found to consist of a wide variety of genetically diverged strains of EEHV1A and EEHV1B matching the subtypes and genetic range of nearly all those found previously in Europe and North America. Cases attributed to EEHV1A and EEHV4 have also been reported in Thailand and there is both confirmed and anecdotal evidence for similar hemorrhagic disease deaths of between 16 and 30 more calves in Asian countries including Thailand, India, Nepal, Myanmar and Indonesia within the past five years. Thus, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> disease of captive elephants, but is endogenous to and possibly rampant in Asian elephants in the wild also. Further research has been noted as [...] "urgently required" [...] to study the situation in regions with wild Asian elephant populations.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} titled the Wonder World Tour {{because of its}} {{diversity}} in themes and styles. Cyrus believed the tour was good transition for solidifying a more rock music-based career. She described the tour to be edgy and [...] "more of a mature show", with the target audience being teenagers relatively her age, which was sixteen at the time. However, performances that would please younger audiences {{were added to the}} setlist. It was conceptualized to be a more elaborate than Cyrus' previous tour and to reflect Cyrus as an individual. The reason for this to occur was because Cyrus felt more confident as a vocalist to perform stunts and use props while singing. Also, more resources were available, for more companies were willing to invest in the tour. Ideas were suggested by different individuals and were tested during filmed rehearsals in order to decide which would make the final cut. [...] "Each person has their own character and their own story. So, we've added everyone's kind of specialty into our show [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> concert, it is an absolute show", Cyrus said. After having completed filming for The Last Song (2010) in Tybee Island, Georgia, Cyrus returned to Los Angeles for tour rehearsals at The Forum in mid-August. Due to filming The Last Song, Cyrus was only able to rehearse for three weeks although the average rehearsal period for musicians is about three months.|$|E

2500|$|Coding in kernel can be challenging, in {{part because}} one cannot use common {{libraries}} (like a full-featured libc), and because one needs to use a source-level debugger like gdb.

For a Christian, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> way of speaking or calling. Awareness of divine filiation is rooted in a divine gift that transforms a person from within. St. John puts it this way: [...] "See what love the Father has for us, that He has called us sons of God, and so we are!...We are truly children of God" [...] (1 Jn 3:1–2). St. Josemaria concludes that [...] "whoever is unaware of this is unaware of his innermost truth;" [...] {{he has not yet}} discovered the deepest reality of his being, nor the meaning of his existence on this earth.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the shootings of Castile and Alton Sterling, President Barack Obama did {{not comment on the}} {{specific}} incidents, but called on the U.S. to [...] "do better" [...] and said that controversial incidents arising from the police use of force were [...] "not isolated incidents" [...] but rather were [...] "symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system". Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about." [...] Obama telephoned Castile's mother to offer his condolences.|$|E
2500|$|Springer began {{traveling}} consistently {{with the}} A4 pod (her mother's closest relatives), and distant cousins in the A5 pod. It was hoped that Springer would form {{a bond with}} a mature female who would act as a surrogate mother. The killer whale known as A51 or [...] "Nodales," [...] a 16-year-old female from the A5 pod who had no calf of her own, appeared to take that role. In August, A51 was observed following Springer and guiding her away from boats, which Dr. Barrett-Leonard described {{as a sign of}} [...] "reciprocalness in the relationship. It convinced me <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> case of A73 finding a placid female she's following around." [...] The bond between Springer and Nodales turned out to not be as strong as a normal mother-offspring bond in killer whales, however. Springer has since often been seen with Nawitti, a 12-year-old female from the A4 pod, and with Springer's great-aunt Yakat. Dr. John Nightingale, Director of the Vancouver Aquarium, stated on ABC World News Tonight With Peter Jennings, [...] "I've been a fascinated spectator, watching these whales get used to each other and her integration into her larger family group." ...|$|E

I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I {{put my arms around}} the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
