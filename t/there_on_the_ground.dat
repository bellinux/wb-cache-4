500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E

50|$|His {{split with}} the Church of England was not amicable and {{involved}} (according to {{one version of}} events; see Johnson in bibliography) sending a canoe-load of Tsimshians, including Peter Simpson, back to Old Metlakatla to destroy <b>the</b> old church <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> that ownership of it should not revert to the CMS. The religious orientation of New Metlakatla became a nondemoninational form of low-church Anglicanism, quite evangelical, and under the strict doctrinal control of Duncan himself.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Weert, but moved to Haarlem via Cologne, where he first lived with Willem van Heuvel. He became a cloth {{merchant}} and lived in a large double house <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oude Gracht (now called Gedempte Oude Gracht) near the Verwulft. Like many other merchants of Haarlem, he owned a summer house along the Spaarne river, facing the Haarlemmerhout park. His neighbor <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of Spaar en Hout, was Zacharias Hooftman, an Amsterdam merchant who lived in <b>the</b> winter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Herengracht. Van Heythuysen never married, but lived with his sister Geertruyd.|$|R

6000|$|It {{would be}} vain, reader {{to attempt to}} give you in detail all that John Jarwin said and did on that great occasion, as he sat <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> caressing his dog {{as if it had}} been his own child. We leave it to your imagination! ...|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s and later, {{many more}} carverys {{appeared}} in London.

60|$|By degrees {{the smoke}} melted away, and <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> were the {{ten or twelve}} crooked pieces of ebony that they had seen consumed, now to all {{appearance}} quite untouched by the flame.

60|$|April 12. Jean {{has been}} in here {{with a copy of}} Literature, {{complaining}} that I am again behind you in the election of the 10 consecrated members; and seems troubled about it and not quite able to understand it. But I have explained to her that you are right <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> inside the pool-booth, keeping game--and that that makes a large difference in these things.|$|E
60|$|Now she {{no longer}} thought of herself; there was but little fear of anyone passing by this way and seeing her as she {{gradually}} crawled nearer and nearer to that inert mass which lay <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> so rigid and silent. Beyond the yard there were only maize-fields, and a tall row of sunflowers closed the place in as with a wall. And not a sound came from old Rézi's cottage.|$|E
50|$|A {{majority}} of the court decided the case in favour of Euro-Excellence, but <b>there</b> was disagreement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> for why <b>the</b> copyright claim could not succeed.|$|R
60|$|Stoutenburg made {{no comment}} on this brief narrative, even the power of cursing seemed to have deserted him. He left Jan {{kneeling}} <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frozen <b>ground,</b> and without a word he turned on his heel {{and made his way}} once more between the beams under the molens back toward the hut.|$|R

6000|$|We {{told him}} it over and over, and that ale had fuddled his wit, [...] But he stood and laughed at us there, as though his sides would split, [...] Till I could stand it no longer, and whipped off his head at a blow, [...] Being mad {{that he did not}} answer, and more at his {{laughing}} so, [...] And <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> where it fell it went on laughing at me.|$|E
6000|$|The {{instant she}} glanced into her tent {{she saw the}} package Isbel had carried. It lay on her bed. Ellen stared blankly. [...] "The--the impudence of him!" [...] she ejaculated. Then she kicked the package out of the tent. Words and action seemed to {{liberate}} a dammed-up hot fury. She kicked the package again, and thought she would kick it into the smoldering camp-fire. But somehow she stopped short of that. She left the thing <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
50|$|Plastic (polycarbonate) {{sunglasses}} generally absorb UV radiation. UV overexposure to {{the eyes}} causes snow blindness, which is a risk particularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea or when <b>there</b> is snow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

60|$|At {{twenty minutes}} past eleven {{a blast of}} wind carried an airy bit of ignited fern several yards forward, in a {{direction}} parallel to the houses and inn, and <b>there</b> deposited it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{flung open}} the door and we rushed in. She was <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> amidst the {{splinters}} of her chair. We seized her and dragged her swiftly out, and as we gained the door I looked over my shoulder into the darkness. There were two strange eyes glowing at us, a rattle of hoofs, and I had just time to slam the door when there came a crash upon it which split it from top to bottom.|$|E
6000|$|So you too think me {{in earnest}} in wagering poll for poll!

60|$|One {{young man}} was hanged in Bishopsgate Street, whose aged grey-headed father waited {{for him at the}} gallows, kissed him at its foot when he arrived, and sat <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> till they took him down. They would have given him the body of his child; but he had no hearse, no coffin, nothing to remove it in, being too poor--and walked meekly away beside the cart that took it back to prison, trying, as he went, to touch its lifeless hand.|$|E

5000|$|Stoner, who is {{particularly}} adept with recreational extra-sensory stimulatory compounds, especially as a pharmacological graduate school drop-out from Purdue University refuses to take {{payment for the}} weed, saying repeatedly that he wouldn't make money off of other peoples pain. Klaus turns even that negative: [...] "Dat earns you a place in Heaffen, maybe, but on Earth, no income." [...] The matter which becomes the topic of a general family discussion after the medical visitors have left, brought up by the boys. Soon, the family conference reminded Stoner of a past fiasco at a town fair where a cloud-burst had ruined the sales of many exotically tie-dyed tee-shirts, also ruining {{what would have been}} a great day as the tee-shirts hadn't been processed to set the dye into the cloth—inadvertently dyeing many a now irate customer. But Stoner knew how to make things colorfast, he was a very good chemist, and had loads of left over dyes here and <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R

Speak, or by the Spirit of Life I will blast thee where thou standest!" [...] and she took one light step towards me, and from her eyes there shone such an awful light--to me it seemed almost like a flame--that I fell, then and <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before her, babbling confusedly in my terror.|$|E
6000|$|Your {{despatch}} of {{last evening}} received. Where {{is the enemy}} which you dread in Louisville? How near to you? What is General Gilbert's opinion? With all possible respect for you, I must think General Wright's military opinion is the better. He is as much responsible for Louisville as for Cincinnati. General Halleck telegraphed him on this very subject yesterday, and I telegraph him now; but for us here to control him <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> would be a babel of confusion which would be utterly ruinous. Where do you understand Buell to be, and what is he doing? ...|$|E
6000|$|So off he went, {{until he}} came to a {{chestnut}} woods just back of the royal kitchen-garden. There he uncorked his bottle. Pop! pop! and out came the two tall men. [...] "What will you have, sir?" [...] said they. Peter told them what he wanted, and it was no sooner said than done; for, <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before him, stood a basketful of all kinds of precious stones; each of them was as large as a hen's egg, and over all of them was spread a nice clean white napkin. So Peter took the basket on his arm and went back again to the palace.|$|E
