After spending seven months in prison, Croitoru was released on $100,000 bail. He was arrested on December 2, 2005 for violating his bail terms, and police filed another extortion charge against him.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{was convicted}} on <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of misuse of {{official}} information, <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of retaliation and <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of official oppression. In June 2011, {{he was sentenced}} to 100 days in jail, four years of felony probation and a $6,000 fine.

Tidwell's trial publicly uncovered a 2004 guilty plea he entered after being charged with soliciting a prostitute. DSHS assessed a $15,850 fine against the hospital for inadequate supervision of Arafiles and illegal termination of Galle and Mitchell.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{changing}} behavior of <b>two</b> <b>counting</b> methods (whole counting and whole-normalized counting) and inflation rate at country level research productivity and impact. For this, publication data on tribology research published between 1998 and 2012 from SCOPUS has been used. Only internationally collaborated papers are considered for comparison between <b>two</b> <b>counting</b> methods. The result of correlation tests shows that there is highly correlation in all the four indicators between the <b>two</b> <b>counting</b> methods. However, the result of t-test shows that there is significant difference in the three indicators (paper count, citation count and h-index) between the <b>two</b> <b>counting</b> methods. This study concludes that whole-normalized counting (fractional) is the better choice for publication and citations counting at the country level assessment.

The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of simple battery and <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E

In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register.

5|$|Upon her {{arrest on}} November 22, 1995, Green {{was charged with}} <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of first-degree murder, <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of {{attempted}} first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. She was held on $3,000,000 bail—the highest ever required {{at that point in}} time by Johnson County, Kansas—and maintained her innocence throughout pre-trial motions and a show cause hearing. However, when the defense's own investigators verified the strength of forensic evidence against Green, she agreed to an Alford plea to all charges. On May 30, 1996, she was sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences. Green has petitioned for a new trial twice since her conviction. Her first request, which she eventually withdrew, was based on a claim of having been rendered incompetent for plea bargaining by the psychiatric medications she was taking at the time of her hearings; her second, which was denied by a judge, claimed that the evidence used to convict her of arson had been rendered obsolete by scientific advances.|$|E

In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to <b>two</b> <b>counts</b> of insubordination during questioning.

Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E
