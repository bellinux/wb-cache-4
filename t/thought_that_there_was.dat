5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle contrasted rule by {{the many}} (democracy/polity), with rule by the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), and with rule by a single person (tyranny or today autocracy/absolute monarchy).

25|$|Space {{agencies}} {{have already had}} experience with returning samples {{thought to be a}} back contamination risk during the Apollo era, when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11.

The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations would be needed. A different approach would be needed for a modern sample return.|$|E

25|$|At {{one time}} it was {{believed}} that Blaufränkisch was a clone of the Gamay grape of Beaujolais, {{due in part to the}} prevalence of the synonym Gamé used in Bulgaria, and perhaps because it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a parent-offspring relationship between the two. However, in the 21st century DNA evidence showed that Blaufränkisch was an offspring of Gouais blanc and an unknown parent, making it a half-sibling to Gamay as well as other varieties of grapes which have Gouais blanc as a parent such as Chardonnay, Riesling, Elbling, Aramon noir, Grolleau noir, Muscadelle and Colombard.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no formal}} system of synagogal reading of Ketuvim {{equivalent}} to the Torah portion and haftarah. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> once a cycle for reading the Psalms, parallel to the triennial cycle for Torah reading, {{as the number of}} psalms (150) is similar to the number of Torah portions in that cycle, and remnants of this tradition exist in Italy. All Jewish liturgies contain copious extracts from the Psalms, but these are normally sung to a regular recitative or rhythmic tune rather than read or chanted. Some communities also have a custom of reading Proverbs in the weeks following Pesach, and Job on the Ninth of Ab.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{already a}} {{settlement}} at {{the confluence of}} the Mugnone with the River Arno between the 10th and the 8th century BC. Between the 7th and 6th centuries BC Etruscans had discovered and used the ford of the Arno near this confluence, closer to the hills of the North and South. A bridge or a ferry was probably constructed here, about ten metres away from the current Ponte Vecchio, but closer to the ford itself. The Etruscans, however, preferred not to build cities on the plain for reasons of defence and instead settled about six kilometres away on a hill. This settlement was a precursor of the fortified centre of Vipsul (today's Fiesole), which was later connected by road to all the major Etruscan centres of Emilia to the North and Lazio to the South.|$|E

25|$|After taking command, Sinclair {{assessed}} {{that the}} companies of the ships off Fiji could not provide sufficient personnel to co-ordinate an evacuation. He asked Gration to provide troops to bolster his strength, and this was authorised by Cabinet in a meeting held on 21 May. By this time, Australia had received requests from seven countries, including the United States and Japan, to evacuate their citizens from Fiji if required. Despite taking this step, the Australian government {{believed that it was}} unlikely that law and order would break down in Fiji, with Foreign Minister Gareth Evans telling the media that he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a 20 percent chance of this occurring. At no stage was it considered possible that the ODF would be involved with fighting against the RFMF, and it was assumed that the Fijian military would want to help assist the evacuation of foreign nationals from the country.|$|E
25|$|Later, Huang Zhong {{heard that}} Cao Cao's forces were {{transporting}} food supplies to Beishan (北山), so {{he led a}} group of soldiers, including some of Zhao Yun's men, to seize the supplies. Huang Zhong did not return after a long time so Zhao Yun led tens of horsemen in search of Huang. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao's forces and engaged them in battle but was outnumbered {{and was forced to}} retreat back to his camp, with Cao Cao's men in pursuit. Zhang Yi, one of Zhao Yun's subordinates, wanted to close the gates to prevent the enemy from entering. However, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, all flags and banners to be hidden, and the war drums silenced. Cao Cao's forces <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an ambush inside Zhao Yun's camp so they withdrew. Just then, Zhao Yun launched a counter-attack and his men beat the war drums loudly and fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray. Some of them trampled on each other while fleeing in panic, and many of them fell into the Han River and drowned.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 1899, war was {{declared}} with a Boer offensive into the British-held Natal and Cape Colony areas, Boer republics, beginning the Second Boer War. In {{the early stages}} of the conflict, Smuts served as Paul Kruger's eyes and ears, handling propaganda, logistics, communication with generals and diplomats, and anything else that was required. In the second phase of the war, Smuts served under Koos de la Rey, who commanded 500 commandos in the Western Transvaal. Smuts excelled at hit-and-run warfare, and the unit evaded and harassed a British army forty times its size. President Kruger and the deputation in Europe <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> good hope for their cause in the Cape Colony. They decided to send General de la Rey there to assume supreme command, but then decided to act more cautiously when they realised that General de la Rey could hardly be spared in the Western Transvaal. Consequently, Smuts was left with a small force of 300 men, while another 100 men followed him. By this point in the war, the British scorched earth policy left little grazing land. One hundred of the cavalry that had joined Smuts were therefore too weak to continue and so Smuts had to leave these men with General Kritzinger. Intelligence indicated that at this time Smuts had about 3,000 men.|$|E

25|$|Rusk first climbed Mount Stuart in 1920. When {{he first}} saw it in 1894, Rusk desired to climb it; however, other matters, {{including}} the McKinley expedition, prevented him from climbing it. That same year, 1920, the Cascadians mountaineering club was formed and with Rusk as a leading member, they decided that a record box {{should be taken to}} the summit. Rusk climbed Stuart with Rolfe Morse Whitnall in July and although Whitnall was unable to make the summit, Rusk was successful and placed the record box on the summit. Their success inspired the club to send another party later that year on Labor Day. This party consisted of Clarence Truitt, Harold Carey, Vern Mason, Joseph R. Vincent, Rolland Whitmore, Wayne E. and Fern Richardson, Rolfe and Alice Whitnall, and Rusk. The whole party made the summit, even though they had some close calls and were forced to bivouac part of the way down the mountain. Rusk climbed Stuart again the next year with Wayne Richardson, Truitt, Rolfe Whitnall, Max Hiscock, and Jimmie Frisque. That year, they climbed earlier in the season, the 29th of May, than any party before and many <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still too much snow to climb at that time in the season. All but Whitnall made the summit. Rusk led another much larger party up Stuart on May 29, 1922.|$|E
25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A normal take-off run was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a problem with the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The engine shutdown was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting down the wrong engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant throttle lever had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E
