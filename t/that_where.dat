5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed <b>that</b> <b>where</b> the public interest is at stake the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner.

5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v.

No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>where</b> the P. rebeli {{lay their}} eggs {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E

5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock.

5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure <b>that</b> <b>where</b> the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Morris {{produced}} {{items in}} a range of crafts, mainly those to do with furnishing, including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and <b>that</b> <b>where</b> possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, and insisted on the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, and insisted on learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 {{the idea}} was resurrected– again by Palmer, who was now Lord Selborne and the new Lord Chancellor– as the Supreme Court of Judicature bill. While still cautious, Selborne's bill was far more {{structured}} than Hatherley's, and contained more detail on {{what was to be}} done. Rather than fusing the common law and equity, which he saw as impracticable since it would destroy the idea of trusts, he decided to fuse the courts and the procedure. The final draft provided that all of the existing superior courts would be fused into one court consisting of two levels; one of first instance, one appellate. The court of first instance, {{to be known as the}} High Court of Justice, would be subdivided into several divisions based on the old superior courts, one of which, the Chancery Division, would deal with equity cases. All jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was to be transferred to the Chancery Division; Section 25 of the Act provided <b>that,</b> <b>where</b> there was conflict between the common law and equity, the latter would prevail. An appeal from each division went to the appellate level, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. These provisions were brought into effect after amendment with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, and the Court of Chancery ceased to exist. The Master of the Rolls was transferred to the new Court of Appeal, the Lord Chancellor retained his other judicial and political roles, and the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist, replaced by ordinary judges. The Chancery Division remains to this day part of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like <b>that,</b> <b>where</b> sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) <b>that</b> <b>where</b> a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her {{the legal right to}} commence an action on the ground <b>that</b> <b>where</b> an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E

5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying <b>that,</b> <b>where</b> a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} <b>that,</b> <b>where</b> a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E
5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held <b>that</b> <b>where</b> the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated <b>that</b> <b>where</b> water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means <b>that</b> <b>where</b> unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
