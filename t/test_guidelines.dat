50|$|Ford Motor Co. {{officials}} said the real-world fuel-efficiency in the C-Max Hybrid depends on driving style and other outside factors, and the company does not expect the car's fuel efficiency numbers to change, as they followed EPA's <b>test</b> <b>guidelines.</b> A Ford spokesman also said they are {{working closely with the}} EPA to determine if any changes are needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing. The carmaker explained that several factors can affect hybrid fuel economy more than regular gasoline engines, and among the differences highlighted were speed, as the difference between 75 mph and 65 mph can produce a 7 mpg difference in fuel economy; outside temperature, the difference between 40 °F and 70 °F can result in a 5 mpg difference; and vehicle break-in, the difference from 0 miles to 6,000 miles can be a 5 mpg difference.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few days}} later the Environmental Protection Agency said it will review claims that two new Ford hybrid {{vehicles}} are not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan commented that hybrids have far more variability in miles per gallon than a conventional vehicle. Most vehicles' real-world gasoline mileage {{is less than the}} EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less than the sticker number depending on speed, temperature and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids the gap is much wider, as high as a 30% drop. Ford responded in a statement, saying that, [...] "Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above 47 mpg. This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary." [...] A Ford spokesman also said they followed EPA's <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> and the company is standing by the ratings as determined by the current testing protocols. Nevertheless, they are working closely with the agency to determine if any changes are needed for the industry relative to hybrid vehicle testing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{replace the}} Draize skin {{irritation}} assay (OECD <b>guideline</b> 404) several <b>test</b> methods based on {{reconstructed human epidermis}} (RHE) have been developed and were adopted in the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> 439. However, all validated test methods in the guideline are linked to RHE provided by only three companies. Thus, the availability of these test models {{is dependent on the}} commercial interest of the producer. To overcome this limitation and thus to increase the accessibility of in vitro skin irritation testing, an open source reconstructed epidermis (OS-REp) was introduced. To demonstrate the capacity of the OS-REp in regulatory risk assessment, a catch-up validation study was performed. The participating laboratories used in-house generated OS-REp to assess the set of 20 reference substances according to the performance standards amending the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> 439. <b>Testing</b> was performed under blinded conditions. The within-laboratory reproducibility of 87 % and the inter-laboratory reproducibility of 85 % prove a high reliability of irritancy testing using the OS-REp protocol. In addition, the prediction capacity was with an accuracy of 80 % comparable to previous published RHE based test protocols. Taken together the results indicate that the OS-REp test method {{can be used as a}} standalone alternative skin irritation test replacing the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> 404...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper charts {{the almost}} ten years of history of OECD's work on nanosafety, during which the {{programme}} of the OECD on the Testing and Assessment of Manufactured Nanomaterials covered the testing of eleven nanomaterials for about 59 end-points addressing physical–chemical properties, mammalian and environmental toxicity, environmental fate and material safety. An overview of the materials tested, the test methods applied and the discussions regarding {{the applicability of the}} OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which are recognised methods for regulatory testing of chemicals, are given. The results indicate that many existing OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> are suitable for nanomaterials and consequently, hazard data collected using such guidelines will fall under OECD's system of Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) which is a legally binding instrument to facilitate the international acceptance of information for the regulatory safety assessment of chemicals. At the same time, some OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> and guidance documents need to be adapted to address nanomaterials while new <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> and guidance documents may be needed to address endpoints that are more relevant to nanomaterials.

The study was conducted at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural center on a sandy clay loam soil irrigated using surface flood methods. Forage sorghum was planted on 8 July 09 and fertilized with eight N rates varying from 0 to 350 lbs N/acre in 50 lb N/acre increments. The plants were sampled six times during the growing season and the lower stem, most recently developed leaf, and whole plant were analyzed for nitrogen content. Maximum yield at final harvest was obtained at 150 lbs N/acre and plant growth was highly affected by N rate. Before the initiation of rapid growth, the relationship between plant growth and N content in the various tissues was weak (R 2 0. 50) from the initiation of rapid growth through the pre-boot stage at the time when post-plant {{nitrogen fertilizer}} application may be considered.
