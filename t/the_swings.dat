5|$|The three-minute ride {{features}} 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats altogether) {{spinning around}} a central tower. A lighting package was installed {{on all four}} WindSeekers, consisting of strips of LED lights mounted on the arms that support <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> and (except at Knott's Berry Farm) colored floodlights to illuminate towers from above.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over a week when {{it was discovered that}} one of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of the}} WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> did not come down. Since these incidents, ride operations are suspended during high winds or heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5000|$|In Estonian, kiik means a swing. In a kiiking <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> {{arms are}} made of steel to enable a person to swing 360 degrees going over the [...] of <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> A person is {{fastened}} to <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> base by their feet. To <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> person begins to pump by squatting and standing up on <b>the</b> <b>swing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> will gain momentum and will, by skillful pumping, take a person over the fulcrum.|$|R
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example is}} a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing {{a person in a}} swing in time with the natural interval of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> (its resonant frequency) makes <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because <b>the</b> energy <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> absorbs is maximized when the pushes match <b>the</b> <b>swing's</b> natural oscillations.|$|R

25|$|Possums Pollytics, an {{anonymous}} weblog, stated {{that due to}} the uneven nature of <b>the</b> <b>swings,</b> where safe Liberal seats were swinging up to 14.6 per cent with safe Labor seats swinging around only 4.1 points, the Labor party stood to potentially {{end up with a}} maximum of 106 of the 150 lower house seats.|$|E
25|$|Clients hold {{a margin}} account with the exchange, {{and every day}} <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> {{in the value of}} their {{positions}} is added to or deducted from their margin account. If the margin account gets too low, they have to replenish it. In this way {{it is highly unlikely that}} the client will not be able to fulfill his obligations arising from the contracts. As the clearing house is the counterparty to all their trades, they only have to have one margin account. This is in contrast with OTC derivatives, where issues such as margin accounts have to be negotiated with all counterparties.|$|E
500|$|The four WindSeekers {{opened in}} 2011 {{are based on}} the same {{prototype}} design by Dutch amusement ride manufacturer Mondial Rides. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland was the first to be completed and thus the first to be tested. It was discovered during testing that <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> could rock back and forth once rotation reached full speed, and were close to hitting each other in some cases. Therefore, hydraulic dampers not included in the original design were added to all four WindSeekers to reduce this rocking. Nevertheless, there were still incidents: on June 14, 2011, <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> on Cedar Point's WindSeeker began to sway in different directions, and some seats almost collided with each other. In one reported case, a rider had to extend his leg to stop the seat in front from hitting him. In another, a car collided with the kneecap of a rider who had closed their eyes. Official explanations suggested that the hydraulic dampers could fail under high winds: apparently, high winds and the imbalance arising when some swings are full and others not could cause <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> to collide. On June 29, 2011, Jennifer Valentyne of Breakfast Television Toronto rode the WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland for her [...] "Live-Eye" [...] spot on the show. When <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> {{reached the top of the}} tower, the seats began swinging and hitting each other. As the ride continued, Breakfast Television hosts Kevin Frankish and Dina Pugliese asked whether the seats were supposed to touch each other, but received no response.|$|E

500|$|All six WindSeekers {{consist of}} the same parts in an {{identical}} structure. The [...] center tower {{is made up of}} eight parts. The base section is different from the other seven tower pieces because it supports the rest of the tower. On top of the eighth tower piece, there is a steel platform where workers and mechanics can observe the operation of the ride and perform maintenance. Above this platform is an element called the [...] "red UFO" [...] or the [...] "Crown". The gondola itself has a number of parts. In the middle of the structure there are wheels that allow <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> to rotate as they go up and down the tower. The gondola is raised and lowered by cables linking the gondola structure to four sets of yellow wheels, each attached to a different section of the steel platform {{at the top of the}} tower. Hydraulic dampers that were not in the original design were added to all the WindSeeker installations to reduce the movement of <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> while in operation. The illustrations below show where the parts are located and what they look like.|$|E
500|$|Humid {{subtropical}} {{regions are}} subject to pronounced dry winters. Winter rainfall—and occasionally snowfall—is associated with large storm systems such as [...] "Nor'westers" [...] and [...] "Western disturbances"; the latter are steered by westerlies towards the Himalayas. Most summer rainfall occurs during powerful thunderstorms associated with the southwest summer monsoon; occasional tropical cyclones also contribute. Annual rainfall ranges from less than [...] {{in the west to}} over [...] in parts of the northeast. As most of this region is far from the ocean, the wide temperature swings more characteristic of a continental climate predominate; <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> are wider than in those in tropical wet regions, ranging from [...] in north-central India to [...] in the east.|$|E
500|$|Two shared-latitude but {{diametrically}} opposed complexes, Pueblo Pintado and Kin Bineola, are located some [...] {{from the core}} buildings of the central canyon. Each lie on a path from the central canyon that is collinear with the passage and setting of the full mid-winter [...] "minimum moon", which recurs every 18.6 years. Two other complexes that are less distant from Pueblo Bonito, Una Vida and Peñasco Blanco, share an axis collinear {{with the passage of}} the full [...] "maximum moon". The terms [...] "minimum" [...] and [...] "maximum" [...] refer to the azimuthal extreme points in the lunar excursion cycle, or <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> in direction relative to true north that the setting full moon exhibits. It takes roughly 9.25 years for the rising or setting full moon nearest to winter solstice to proceed from its maximum azimuthal north, or [...] "maximum extremum", to its southernmost azimuth, known as [...] "minimum extremum".|$|E
50|$|For a {{pendulum}} <b>swing</b> at <b>the</b> North Pole it is {{shown that the}} surface velocity vectors of the Earth underneath one side of <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing</b> are directed {{in opposition to the}} velocity vectors underneath the other side of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> (see Figure 1). The Earth's rotation can then be observed in relation to <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing.</b> At <b>the</b> North Pole the support-point of <b>the</b> pendulum <b>swing</b> is located on the axis of rotation of the Earth. No matter what vertical orientation is established by the plane of <b>the</b> <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> relative velocity vectors of the Earth's surface on opposite sides and equidistant from the center point of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> will be in opposition.

500|$|Galileo's {{theoretical}} and experimental {{work on the}} motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and René Descartes, was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani) that these began by watching <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his Two New Sciences. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is isochronous, i.e. that its swings always take {{the same amount of}} time, independently of the amplitude. In fact, this is only approximately true, as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its verge escapement, would have been a poor timekeeper. (See Engineering above.) ...|$|E
500|$|While Koiwai works, Yotsuba plays {{house with}} her wooden blocks, then talks her father into a game of hide and seek and playing on <b>the</b> <b>swings</b> in the park.

While her father finishes an assignment, Jumbo babysits Yotsuba and gives her a book about animals. The next day, Jumbo takes the Koiwais shopping for a digital camera. While the adults compare cameras, Yotsuba explores the electronics store with Fuka.

50|$|Six {{distinct}} stages {{are involved}} in the kick: the approach angle, the plant foot force, <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> limb loading, <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> phase, ball contact, and the follow through. The first is the “approach angle” when a kicker runs up to the ball. The second stage is the plant foot force, which involves situating the supporting foot at a distance lateral from the ball prior to kicking. The third stage is <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> limb loading that requires the preparation of the hip flexors and knee extensors to load or eccentrically stretch for forward movement in order for <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> limb to strike the ball. It is also known as the backswing phase. The fourth stage is when the hip flexors and knee extensors initiate a forceful contraction in <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> limb at a high velocity towards the ball. This stage is considered <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> phase. <b>The</b> fifth stage is when <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> foot makes complete contact with the ball. Lastly, once the foot makes impact, the kicker should try to keep their foot in contact with the ball as long as they can. This is possible by proceeding with <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> limb until ball is out of contact. This stage is also known as the follow through phase.|$|R

40|$|The {{decisions}} of the Court are partially grounded in {{the ideology of the}} justices themselves, which is the attitudinal model of the Court. I argue that <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice on the Supreme Court has a substantial effect in determining the ideological direction of the Court over time. If the attitudinal model of the Court is correct, then <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice on the Court has a disproportionate amount of influence on the direction of the Court over time.

Previous literature has identified <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> vote justice, but only to determine how powerful that justice is relative to the other justices on the Court.
