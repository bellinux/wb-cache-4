5|$|As of October 2010, {{there are}} four rest areas {{operating}} along the A6 motorway, as a new rest area opened on October 9, 2010 next to the western portal of Tuhobić Tunnel on the VrataOštrovica section of the route. Applicable legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types A through D: A-type rest areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodations; and D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, with possibly some picnic tables, benches, and restrooms. Even though the rest areas found along the A6 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations, as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Lepenica rest areaeven though it has no restaurant and therefore falls below B-type rest area standard, <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> instance, an RV park available. The filling stations typically have small convenience stores and some of them offer LPG fuel. As of October 2010, all of the rest areas found along the A6 motorway comply with C-type rest area standards or above.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2010, {{there are}} 26 rest areas {{operating}} along the A1 motorway, and additional rest areas are planned along the existing {{sections of the}} route and those sections under construction. Legislation provides for four types of rest areas designated as types A through D—A-type rest areas comprise {{a full range of}} amenities including a filling station, a restaurant and a hotel or a motel; B-type rest areas have no lodging; C-type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café, but no restaurants or accommodation; D-type rest areas offer parking spaces only, possibly some picnicking tables and benches and restrooms. Even though the rest areas found along the A1 motorway generally follow this ranking system, there are considerable variations as some of them offer extra services. The most notable example is Krka rest area—even though it has no filling station, <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> instance, a restaurant available. The filling stations regularly have small convenience stores and some of them offer LPG fuel. EuroTest, an international association of 18 European automobile clubs spearheaded by German automobile club ADAC, surveyed three of the A1 motorway rest areas in 2009: Krka, Lički Osik and Modruš (in case of the latter, both eastbound and westbound). All of the rest areas were rated as very good, especially in terms of facilities offered.|$|E

25|$|In the Standard Model, each lepton {{starts out}} with no {{intrinsic}} mass. The charged leptons (i.e. the electron, muon, and tau) obtain an effective mass through {{interaction with the}} Higgs field, but the neutrinos remain massless. For technical reasons, the masslessness of the neutrinos implies {{that there is no}} mixing of the different generations of charged leptons as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> quarks. This is in close agreement with current experimental observations.|$|E

A motif of paired flying winged figures which is seen on pagan Roman sarcophagi passed into Christian art as a very commonly used portrayal of angels. The reproduction of figures from manuscripts was particularly common in stained glass windows with various Biblia Pauperum being frequent sources.|$|E

25|$|Impacted wisdom teeth (or {{impacted}} third molars) are wisdom teeth {{which do}} not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth (impaction). If the wisdom teeth {{do not have an}} open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth. Common accepted hypothesis that determine eruption is the angle at which the 3rd molars sit, the stage of root formation of 3rd molars at the point of screening, depth of impaction, how much room <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> eruption as well as the size of the 3rd molar.|$|E
25|$|Multiplexes {{can make}} use of {{statistical}} multiplexing at the MPEG video coder whereby the bitrate allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on {{how difficult it is}} to code the picture content at that precise time, and how much demand <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> bandwidth from other channels. In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E

25|$|Romani (also {{known as}} the Romani Chib) is the {{language}} spoken by the Romani people, a nomadic ethnic group originating in northern India. Due to the geographic origins of its speakers, Romani is an Indo-Aryan language, closely related to languages spoken in modern-day India, and sometimes written with an Indic Script (see Romani writing systems). Around 90% of Sweden's Romani people speak Romani, meaning that there are approximately 9,500 Chib speakers. In Sweden, there is no major geographic center for Romani like <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> Finnish, Sami, or Meänkieli, but it {{is considered to be}} of historical importance by the Swedish government, and as such the government is seen as having an obligation to preserve them, a distinction also held by Yiddish.|$|E
25|$|Once {{detection}} becomes public, decision-makers would exert influence by the {{way they}} evaluate the importance and handle the publicity of the discovery. It is possible that such actors would emphasize or minimize its importance to extract political advantage. The contact could be framed as a positive development that will benefit the nation and humankind. Likewise, it could be used to warn of potential dangers and provoke public anxieties. Each course of action would have profound effects on how the press and the general public react. Michaud posits that the more decipherable the information received from contact with ETI, the higher a chance <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> political reaction against alien cultural influences. Extremist groups, both religious and secular, could weigh in, attacking information from ETI as evil or immoral. It is possible that this would spark attempts to terminate communication by interfering with the signal or targeting the detecting technology with attacks. Albert Harrison has written that it would be “foolish and negligent” to fail to anticipate such reactions in the formulation of policies and plans.|$|E

500|$|The reader's {{experience}} of Lucy is {{filtered through the}} narrator's perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (1878–1960), [...] "The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy's perfection in Nature and her death <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all." [...] Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: [...] "Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version {{of the death of}} Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline." ...|$|E
