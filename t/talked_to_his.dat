5|$|After {{getting his}} degree, O'Donnell moved to Chicago, where he {{expected}} {{that he would}} teach at the American Conservatory of Music. The job fell through, and instead {{he worked as a}} grip in the film and television business. O'Donnell began his musical career in the field after one of his colleagues who knew of his music background approached him to write for his film. O'Donnell <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits from the job with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E

25|$|Palme's {{decision}} {{to visit the}} Grand Cinema was made at very short notice. Lisbet Palme had discussed seeing a film {{when she was at}} work during the afternoon, and called her son, Mårten Palme, at 17:00 to talk about the film at the Grand Cinema. Olof Palme did not hear about the plans until at home, at 18:30, when he met with his wife, by which time Palme had already declined any further personal bodyguard protection from the security service. He <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son about the plans on the phone, and they eventually decided to join Mårten and his girlfriend, who had already purchased tickets for themselves to see the Swedish comedy Bröderna Mozart ("The Mozart Brothers") by Suzanne Osten. This decision was made about 20:00. The police later searched Palme's apartment, as well as Lisbet's and Mårten's work places, for wire-bugging devices or traces of such equipment, but did not find any.|$|E
500|$|Despite Kemp's {{return from}} injury {{and the arrival}} of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only {{compiled}} a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife before deciding to enter politics. Kemp said, [...] "I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ...I figured that if I lost I could always come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1916, the 5th Division {{was sent}} [...] {{across the desert}} to defend the Suez Canal. The {{crossing}} was first attempted by the 14th Brigade, who suffered badly. Elliott personally inspected the route, talked with officers familiar with it, and drew up a new timetable for the march, managing to get his men across with {{only a handful of}} casualties. On the march, one man forgot the ban on smoking. Elliott characteristically started to scream at the man, even threatening to shoot him. Out from the ranks came a shout: [...] "If you shoot him, I'll shoot you." [...] When the soldier who called out was brought forward and explained that no one <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother like that, Elliott sent the man to his school for non-commissioned officers, with the rationale that anyone who could stand up to himself in full flight clearly had leadership potential.|$|E

500|$|Following Michigan's season-ending {{loss in the}} 2011 Gator Bowl, {{head coach}} Rich Rodriguez was fired and {{replaced}} by Brady Hoke. As Robinson had thrived in Rodriguez's spread offense, the coaching change led to speculation that Robinson may transfer. On January 17, 2011, Robinson ended the speculation when he issued a statement confirming that he would stay at Michigan. [...] In the video statement released by the University of Michigan, Robinson said he seriously considered transferring and noted that Rodriguez {{was one of the}} few coaches willing to give him the chance to play quarterback at the next level. [...] Robinson explained his decision to stay at Michigan: [...] "This is my family. [...] This is my home now. ... I couldn't let it go." [...] He also noted that he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> teammates and told them, [...] "'You know, I can't just leave you out there.' I've been around these guys two years and we've bonded and it's like a family here. There's nothing like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Ulrich <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Ron Quintana, who was {{brainstorming}} {{names for}} a fanzine. Quintana had proposed the names MetalMania and Metallica. Ulrich named his band Metallica. A second advertisement {{was placed in}} The Recycler for a position as lead guitarist. Dave Mustaine answered; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, [...] "Hit the Lights", for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield played bass on the song, and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo. Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as [...] "Mettallica". Although angered by the error, Metallica created enough [...] "buzz" [...] with the song, and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982, at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney. The band's first taste of live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, whose name was inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.|$|E
500|$|After co-starring on 2004's {{fourth season}} of The Shield on cable network FX, Close told network {{president}} John Landgraf {{that she would}} be open to star in another series, suggesting a spin-off for her Shield character, Captain Monica Rawling. Landgraf pitched Damages to Close, who agreed to play Patty so long as the series was shot in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for her role, Close met New York attorney Mary Jo White and her partner Lorna Scoffield, as well as litigator Patricia Hines, from whom Close learned [...] "some extraordinary things". The producers sought after Byrne to play Ellen, but she was unavailable during the first round of auditions as she was filming 28 Weeks Later. She says the opportunity [...] "came up again, so I went in, auditioned, and got the role". Like Close, Byrne spent time with a female lawyer in New York and read books written by litigators Alan Dershowitz and David DuBois, while Donovan <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> uncle, a New York corporate lawyer. He visited Manhattan's Centre Street courts, where he [...] "followed the most intense murder trial". Ivanek was so eager to work on the series that he auditioned for two different roles, and was cast as Ray. Todd Kessler said that Danson's 1979 film The Onion Field was [...] "a huge influence on Glenn, Daniel and myself, and that was something that had always stuck in our minds. And when we sought out to cast this role of Arthur Frobisher, Ted kind of came into focus." [...] In preparation for his role, the producers asked Danson to meet with CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations and watch documentaries such as , which examines the collapse of Enron. They also suggested that Danson meet with Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. The producers said that David and Katie were the hardest characters to cast. Noah Bean, who felt that he gave [...] "an awful first audition" [...] for the role of David, was called in for a second reading as he was waiting for an elevator to leave the building, and was ultimately cast. British actress Anastasia Griffith's agent informed her of the audition for the role of Katie only two hours before it began. When she met the producers, they were initially concerned about a Brit playing an American, especially since Australian Byrne had already signed on. [...] "To put their fears at rest", Griffith addressed the producers in an American accent from beginning to end of the audition. After being cast, Griffith and Byrne visited New York University dialect coach Deborah Hecht to perfect their accents.|$|E

2500|$|In Mashhad {{he used to}} {{participate}} in the literary associations along with known poets and used to criticize poems. In his analysis of the Persian poetry of Muhammad Iqbal, he states that [...] "we have a large number of non-Persian-speaking poets {{in the history of our}} literature, but I cannot point out any of them whose poetry possesses the qualities of Iqbal's Persian poetry. Iqbal was not acquainted with Persian idiom, as he spoke Urdu at home and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friends in Urdu or English. He did not know the rules of Persian prose writing." [...] Written some poems himself, he chose pseudonym 'Amin' for himself.|$|E
2500|$|Former girlfriend Kym Wilson and her then-boyfriend, Andrew Reyment, {{were the}} last people to see Hutchence alive when they left him at 4:50am; he was still {{awaiting}} {{a phone call from}} Yates in London concerning whether she would bring their daughter Tiger to Australia. Hutchence's second last outgoing phone call was to his personal manager, Martha Troup's voice-mail, [...] "Marth, Michael here. I've fucking had enough." [...] When Troup returned the call there was no answer. At 9:54am he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> former longtime girlfriend, Michèle Bennett, who stated that he was crying, sounded upset and said he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his door at about 10:40am, but there was no response. Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50am. Police reported that, [...] "He was in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snake skin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closure {{at the top of the}} door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, Lewis {{studied at}} the Southwest Bible Institute in Waxahachie, Texas, before being thrown out for daring to play a boogie-woogie version of [...] "My God Is Real", and that early {{incident}} foreshadowed his lifelong conflict over his faith in God and his love of playing [...] "the devil's music." [...] Lewis had a recorded argument with Sam Phillips during the recording session for [...] "Great Balls of Fire", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous ("How can...How can the devil save souls? [...] What are you talkin' about?" [...] he asks Phillips during one heated exchange). During the famous Million Dollar Quartet jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer Rick Bragg explains {{that part of the}} reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because [...] "only Elvis and Jerry Lee [...] raised in the Assembly of God", and Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words … they was Baptists', [...] said, and therefore deprived." [...] He often <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cousin, Jimmy Swaggart, about the condition of his soul. Evangelist Swaggart and Lewis would pray together, but Lewis found it hard to alter his lifestyle. Evangelist Swaggart still often speaks with love of his cousin in his sermons, of their childhood together, and their continuing relationship. He will ask for prayers for Lewis if he is suffering illness.|$|E

2500|$|The A's offered Boros a {{front-office}} job, but he declined. Unemployed {{during a}} baseball {{season for the}} first time in over 20 years, Boros said he would take some time off but hoped to manage again. He met with the press at his home, drinking from a cup that read [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy." [...] He noted that the team's management felt he wasn't tough enough on the players, especially Rickey Henderson. Boros said, [...] "This nice guy label — I'm kind of getting clubbed to death with it. The public misinterpreted it when it saw a manager who went and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> players and asked their feelings. That all helped to create this impression of too nice a guy, one who can't make up his mind. The players are telling him what to do." [...] Sports Illustrated ran a feature on the firing of Boros several months later. The article refuted the charge that Boros lacked toughness but opened as follows:"When the Oakland A's dismissed Steve Boros in May, the manager's failing was more narrowly defined: He wasn't 'tough enough.' Newspapers across the country solemnly reported this canard. The shortcoming most mentioned was that the A's skipper didn't sufficiently 'stand up for his players'; that is, he didn't kick dirt on umpires or get thrown out of games. It was also revealed that Boros had read more than 100 books, cover to cover, and had other wimpy interests. Real men don't eat quiche. Tough guys don't dance. And so on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, {{the role}} was recast in 1990 to the actor Todd Carty, renowned {{for his role}} as Tucker Jenkins in Grange Hill. At this time, Mark {{returned}} to the series as a permanent character. The most notable storyline involving Mark was the revelation that he had contracted HIV. Mark discovered he was HIV positive in 1991, and informed his family of this on Christmas Day that year. There then followed a traumatic journey as he struggled first {{to come to terms with}} the news, then track down his previous partners to inform them that he was infected with the virus. The problems didn't end there, however, as Mark then had to battle with the fear and ignorance of those living around him including his parents. Many of Albert Square's residents initially rejected him when they found out that he was HIV positive. Mark married one of his ex-partners Gill (Susanna Dawson), who had also been infected with the virus but in her case it had progressed to AIDS, and she subsequently died the day after the wedding. The episode in which Gill died (written by Debbie Cook and directed by Leonard Lewis) has been chosen by writer Colin Brake as one of the most memorable episodes of 1992. In his book, EastEnders: The First Ten Years Blake comments, [...] "Although in many ways the episode was sad and downbeat it was not without its positive aspects, as Mark <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister about his own mortality." [...] Susanna Dawson, the actress who played Gill, found the experience of playing a person living with, and dying from, AIDS so intense that she co-produced an educational video based on the subject for use in schools and wrote a book, The Gill and Mark Story, to accompany it.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{just won}} the battle of Zapote, Aguinaldo turned his {{attention}} at the new Spanish threat determined to recapture most of Cavite. Aguinaldo decided to deploy his forces at Pasong Santol {{that serves as a}} bottleneck of Perez Dasmariñas on the way to Imus rendering the Spanish lack of mobility and serving the revolutionaries with natural defensive positions. On February 19, Silang fell to the Spanish juggernaut despite attempts by Filipino forces to defend and then later, recover it. Nine days later, Spanish forces marched into Dasmariñas to reclaim the town. The week after, Spanish troops with good use of artillery pieces they brought along were on the attack again as they moved towards the Aguinaldo's capital, Imus. Meanwhile, at the Tejero's Convention, Emilio was voted [...] in absentia {{as the president of the}} reorganized revolutionary government. Colonel Vicente Riego de Dios was sent by the assembly to fetch Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo who was then in Pasong Santol. The General refused to come, so Crispulo was then sent to talk to his brother. He greeted and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother and explained his purpose, but Emilio was hesitant to leave his post because of the pending attack of the Spanish in Dasmariñas. In March 1897, a stalemated battle between the revolutionary army of Crispulo Aguinaldo, while taking over General Emilio Aguinaldo's leadership in battle, and the Spanish forces, led by José de Lachambre, occurred in this trail. The Filipinos' resistance was tenacious as ever, refusing to give ground but the far more disciplined Spaniards advanced steadily. Emilio Aguinaldo realizing the size of the enemy and the danger of the situation, sent Magdalo troops to reinforce the threatened salient but Supremo Andres Bonifacio summoned Magdiwang troops under Artemio Ricarte to intercept the Magdalo troops to Pasong Santol thus preventing help to the revolutionary soldiers, citing he needed the soldiers elsewhere. The Spaniards pressed the offensive achieving tactical superiority which led to the massacre of the Filipino soldiers, including Aguinaldo's brother. The Spaniards only captured this salient after Crispulo was killed during the battle, and the rebels promptly broke off the engagement and reorganized inside the town. Exploiting the gap among the revolutionaries, the Spaniards decisively defeated the Magdalo forces.|$|E
