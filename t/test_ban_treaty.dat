40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine the effectiveness of using commercial satellite data to detect covert nuclear weapons programs. Seven-band Landsat Thematic Mapper data covering the Pahute Mesa (an area within the United States Nevada Nuclear Testing Site), acquired on October 16, 1985, were analyzed to determine if underground nuclear test sites were spectrally distinguishable from the surrounding area. The analysis consisted of four steps: (1) analyzing the raw data, (2) manipulating the raw data through contrast stretching, filter application, matrix algebra, and principal components analyses, (3) identifying parameters that affect classification of underground nuclear tests and (4) selectively limiting parameters. The results of limiting parameters showed that a supervised classification of a signature created with a five-original-pixel seed of one representative, known test site provided an accurate classification of most known test sites. To further eliminate erroneous classification of roads and other areas of similar reflectance, these areas were seeded to create a second signature. This signature, whose spectral responses were different, was then used in a simultaneous classification. This classification further eliminated erroneous classification of non-test site areas, demonstrating that commercial satellite digital data can aid in the detection of covert nuclear weapons programs, in this case, underground nuclear testing. An application of the classification scheme used is proposed to confront a scenario in which a country seeks additional verification of another party's proposed violation of <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaties.</b> Department of Physics and AstronomyThesis (M.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, {{advances}} in sensor technology has lead to increases in the demand for computerized methods for analyzing seismological signals. Central {{to the understanding of}} the mechanisms generating seismic signals is the knowledge of the phases of seismic waves. Being able to specify the type of wave leads to better performing seismic early warning systems and can also aid in nuclear weapons <b>testing</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaty</b> verification. In this thesis, we propose a new method for the classification of seismic waves measured from a three-channel seismograms. The seismograms are divided into overlapping time windows, where each time-window is mapped to a set of multi-scale three-dimensional unitary vectors that describe the orientation of the seismic wave present in the window at several physical scales. The problem of classifying seismic waves becomes one of classifying points on several two-dimensional unit spheres. We solve this problem by using kernel-based machine learning methods that are uniquely adapted to the geometry of the sphere. The classification of the seismic wave relies on our ability to learn the boundaries between sets of points on the spheres associated with the different types of seismic waves. At each signal scale, we define a notion of uncertainty attached to the classification that takes into account the geometry of the distribution of samples on the sphere. Finally, we combine the classification results obtained at each scale into a unique label. We validate our approach using a dataset of seismic events that occurred in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, between 2005 and 2006...|$|R

40|$|The {{legacy of}} nearly five of rapid {{industrialization}} throughout the Southwest includes sites where volatile contaminants have been accidentally or intentionally released at or immediately below the surface. Understanding the mechanism {{and rate of}} volatile transport trough the vadose zone is important to assessing the potential impact on groundwater resources. This is particularly significant in and environments where the inseminated (vadose) zone above the water table {{may be more than}} 300 m thick. While numerical models have been developed to predict the movement of volatiles trough the unsaturated zone, there are only limited opportunities to verify predictions against field data. Field measurements of vadose zone transport are important in terms of constraining model parameters and can be applied to a variety of contaminant issues. This includes the ability to monitor and detect deep underground explosions in violation of nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaties.</b> We have investigated the movement of vadose zone gases in a deep alluvial basin at the Nevada Test Site. The opportunity to study the migration of soil gases in this setting is unique due to the access afforded by the Joint Test Organization`s U-la tunnel complex, mined at a depth of approximately 300 m below ground surface in the alluvium of Yucca Flat (Allen, 1995; Allen, 1996). The tunnel complex is more than 180 m above the standing water level (Figure 1). In this portion of Yucca Flat the alluvium is poorly sorted and consists of channel cut and overbank deposits that contain a mixture of Tertiary volcanic and pre-Tertiary sedimentary detritus locally derived from nearby volcanic and sedimentary sources. The porosity of the alluvium ranges from 31 to 35 %.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to seismic monitoring, the task of detecting seismic events from potentially noisy and cluttered signals recorded across multiple stations. Unlike previous work, which represents seismic signals by a lossy set of discrete detections, we specify a generative probability model of raw seismic waveforms, incorporating a rich representation of the physics underlying the signal generation process, including source mechanisms, wave propagation, and station response. Inference in this model recovers the qualitative behavior of geophysical methods including waveform matching and double-differencing, all as part of a unified Bayesian monitoring system that simultaneously detects and locates events from a network of stations. Our model of seismic signals combines physically meaningful latent variables such as phase travel times, amplitudes, and signal decay rates, with data-driven models based on historical signals. Detailed waveform structure is represented using Gaussian process models of wavelet coefficients, encoding a general assumption that seismic signals are spatially corre- lated, and allowing us to detect and locate events even from weak signals at a single station. We show that the wavelet coefficients can be marginalized out using message passing applied to a state-space representation of the signal model, allowing for practical inference using a reversible jump Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We evaluate our system, SIGVISA (Signal-based Vertically Integrated Seismic Analysis), on a task of monitoring the western United States for a two-week period following the magnitude 6. 0 event in Wells, NV in February 2008. During this period, SIGVISA detects between two to three times as many events as detection-based systems, while reducing mean location errors by a factor of four. We provide evidence that SIGVISA detects some events that are missed even by the regional monitoring networks that we use as a ground-truth comparison. A primary driver of monitoring research is the verification of nuclear <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaties,</b> which are particularly concerned with detecting events in regions with no nearby historical seismicity. In our experiments, SIGVISA matches or exceeds the detection rates of existing systems for such events, and even detects a number of such events missed by human analysts...|$|R
40|$|Reliability {{assessment}} {{in the coming}} era is inclined to be characterized by a difficult dilemma. On the one hand units and systems {{will be required to}} be ultra reliable; on the other hand, it may not be possible to subject them to a full-scale testing. A case in point occurs where testing is limited is one-of-a-kind complex systems, such as space exploration vehicles or where severe testing constraints are imposed such as full scale testing of strategic nuclear weapons prohibited by <b>test</b> <b>ban</b> <b>treaties</b> and international agreements. Decision makers also require reliability assessments for problems with terabytes of data, such as from complex simulations of system performance. Quantitative measures of reliability and their associated uncertainties will remain integral to system monitoring and tactical decision making. The challenge is to derive these defensible measures in light of these dilemmas. Because reliability is usually defined as a probability that the system performs to its required specification, probability enters into the heart of these dilemmas, both philosophically and practically. This paper provides an overview of the several interpretations of probability as they relate to reliability and to the uncertainties involved. The philosophical issues pertain to the interpretation and the quantification of reliability. For example, how must we interpret a number like 10 {sup {minus} 9 }, for the failure rate of an airplane flight or an electrical power plant? Such numbers are common, particularly in the context of safety. Does it mean one failure in 10 {sup 9 } identical, or almost identical, trials? Are identical trials physically possible, let alone the fact that 10 {sup 9 } trials can take generations to perform? How can we make precise the notion of almost identical trials? If the trials are truly identical, then all of them must produce the same outcome and so the reliability must be either one or zero. However tautologies, like certainty and impossibility, can be claimed only on the basis of pure logic, not empirical evidence. Thus, from a practical point of view, an interpretation of reliability that is devoid of abstractions like 10 {sup 9 } identical trials, appears to be in order. It is the meaning of probability that lies {{at the core of the}} interpretation of reliability...|$|R
