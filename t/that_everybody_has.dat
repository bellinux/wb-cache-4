He stated <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> {{a right to have}} a portrait so he agreed to work for whatever low commission the subject could afford.

5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has,</b> so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has,</b> it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E

500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{suggests}} {{that one of}} the reasons for Harrison's follow-up album, Extra Texture (Read All About It), being rushed into production in April 1975 was to [...] "redeem the artist from negative fallout" [...] created by Dark Horse over the winter of 1974–75. Having come up with little new material in the previous six months, Harrison revisited songs he had written or begun writing in 1973, one of which was titled [...] "World of Stone". While discussing the song in September 1975, with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, Harrison commented: [...] "There's not much of a story to it ... it's really just down to saying <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> their own opinion and right to be ... It's a nice melody." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{losing the}} World Series {{in six games}} to the Boston Red Sox, Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak {{explained}} that Miller's role was as [...] "insurance." [...] In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start– which was {{the final game of}} the year– did a starter go less than five innings. [...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. [...] Said Matheny, [...] "It {{would have to be a}} situation where we were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just not fair to him without having much action to this point. [...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold. [...] The fact <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> stepped up changed the dynamic." ...|$|E
500|$|Activision had {{initially}} {{applied for a}} trademark on the name DJ Hero in early 2008, leading to speculation that Activision was making plans to compete against Konami's Beatmania series of music video games with their own DJ game as a possible spinoff of their popular Guitar Hero series. FreeStyleGames, a small developer of music games, was employed to help produce localized downloadable content for Guitar Hero games and develop another yet-to-be announced music game. This game was later revealed to be DJ Hero. Activision CEO Robert Kotick confirmed the existence of DJ Hero {{in an interview with}} CNBC on January 20, 2009, revealing a release [...] "later this year". [...] Activision CFO Thomas Tippl stated that DJ Hero would be aimed at a broader audience than the Guitar Hero games primarily through the use of more contemporary music in its soundtrack. Producer Will Townsend stated they opted {{for a wide variety of}} music to [...] "make sure <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> something in there that they want." [...] DJ Hero was designed as a party game and to make the player [...] "the life of the party", giving ways for them to be [...] "in control of the music", according to Townsend.|$|E

2500|$|A {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Slug's lyrics is his allegorical usage of women, especially in his earlier work. A notable use of women by Slug {{is in the}} song [...] "Woman with the Tattooed Hands", which he has said is [...] "a metaphor for that same old shit <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> already made songs about. Just trying to find your place within a belief and faith {{as well as people}} that you want to have sex with." [...] Further examples come in the song [...] "Abusing of the Rib" [...] from {{it has been said that}} the [...] "lover" [...] Slug speaks of is actually an allegory for hip-hop itself. In the tour-only release Sad Clown Bad Dub II, Slug used both symbolism and metaphor with references to nature and relationships throughout each song, culminating in the album's penultimate track [...] "The River." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name Pet Sounds was Love's invention, {{according}} to himself, Brian, and Jardine. Brian {{explained that the}} album was named [...] "after the dogs... That was the whole idea", and that the title was a [...] "tribute" [...] to Spector by matching his initials (PS), but could not recall who thought {{of going to the}} zoo. Love recounted: [...] "We were standing in the hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title.... We had taken pictures at the zoo and... there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" [...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality. It wasn't going in and doing another top ten. It had so much more meaning than that." ...|$|E

30|$|Feedback in Table 5 {{shows that}} many {{students}} benefited from repeated engagement with theory in the seminar, progressing to deeper understanding. The value of formative feedback by the facilitator that rectified misunderstandings and facilitated the discussions is seen in Teaching Presence. The high saliency of these findings suggests that providing only lectures, or video recordings of lectures, risks leaving students behind with cognitive gaps and misunderstandings if they cannot ask questions (Milman, 2012). The success of working in groups to solve problem cases indicated <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>had</b> a sufficient theoretical base from which to contribute meaningfully to the discussion (Abeysekera & Dawson, 2015).|$|R
