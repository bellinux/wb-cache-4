5|$|During {{his time}} in office, Ross {{proposed}} tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of propertyat that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> deal with a treasury surplus.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, {{soon after}} Delaware {{and the other}} Thirteen Colonies {{declared}} independence from Britain, the state adopted its first state constitution. It created the office of President of Delaware, a chief executive to be chosen by <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> serve a term of three years.|$|E

5|$|The Governor of Florida is {{the head}} of the {{executive}} branch of Florida's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.

5|$|Two {{counties}} were {{proposed in}} Florida's state legislature, but neither actually became counties. A bill {{was passed by}} <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> create Bloxham County, but residents did not vote to approve it. See Leigh Read County, Florida for the events surrounding the proposed county.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river navigation. He persuaded <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers {{to the federal government}} so they could be improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E
5|$|Effective {{with the}} 100th Congress in 1987, {{adjustments}} {{were made by}} <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> the boundaries. A {{small part of the}} Montgomery County territory was detached, as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion. Part of Brown County was added, Jackson and Eagle Townships. These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen's service in Congress.|$|E

5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned <b>to</b> appear before <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> but opted <b>to</b> respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> attempted <b>to</b> removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> attempted <b>to</b> abolish <b>the</b> Court of Appeals {{and replace it with}} a more sympathetic court.|$|R
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Knott {{defeated}} Republican Thomas Z. Morrow {{by a margin}} of nearly 45,000 votes. During his term in office, he asked <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making equitable tax assessments. The legislature also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.|$|E
5|$|Marostica, {{regarded}} as a moderate Republican, focused heavily on fiscal issues as a legislator, including transparency and loosening budgetary restrictions, {{and sat on the}} legislature's Joint Budget Committee during the 2009 session. In July 2009, Marostica resigned from <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> accept the post of economic development director in the cabinet of Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, where he has focused on attracting and growing business in the state of Colorado during the ongoing recession.|$|E
5|$|The organic {{laws were}} based on the laws of Iowa Territory. The {{document}} outlined the legislative branch and its powers, vested in a unicameral or single body. At that time the title of the legislature was the Legislative Committee and it consisted of nine elected representatives apportioned by population to the four established districts (which later became counties). The Organic Laws required <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> meet in June and December of each year.|$|E

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> prevent an act or {{decision}} by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute {{to indicate that the}} decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Article 12(2) {{is subject}} to an express {{contrary}} authorization by the Constitution. Article 39A empowers <b>the</b> <b>Legislature</b> <b>to</b> ensure {{that members of the}} Malay, Indian and other minority communities are represented in Parliament by enacting a law to create Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates, at least one of whom must be from a minority community. Article 39A(3) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12.|$|E
5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E

5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|During his term, Marshall focused {{primarily}} on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated {{the passage of a}} child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Ford rebuilt the state's Democratic machine, which would help elect him and others, including Senator Walter Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins. When Governor Nunn asked <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted. Ford lost this battle; the increase passed without exemptions. From 1970 to 1971, Ford {{was a member of}} the Executive Committee of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E

50|$|During Sparks' administration, a {{constitutional}} amendment was passed requiring <b>the</b> state <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> convene every two years instead of every four years. <b>The</b> <b>legislature</b> continued <b>to</b> be dominated by rural counties and was not reapportioned to acknowledge changes {{in the state and}} movement of population to urban centers until mid-century. One of Sparks' greatest achievements was his success in reducing the state debt by 25 percent.|$|R

5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran {{contrary}} to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In 1758 the State of New Jersey {{purchased}} the Indian title to lands in that State, {{and as a}} consideration for the purchase, bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, to the contrary notwithstanding. The Indians, {{from the time of}} purchase, lived upon the land until the year 1801, when they were authorized, by an act of <b>the</b> <b>Legislature,</b> <b>to</b> sell the land.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> <b>to</b> construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E
