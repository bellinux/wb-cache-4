5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring was done with <b>the</b> <b>computerized</b> CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be a major reason for the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on <b>the</b> <b>computerized</b> scouting reports that almost all other teams were using, and hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring of a head coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse {{that it would be better}} for any prospect to gain a year of experience and knowledge in his present job, rather than be named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. <b>The</b> <b>computerized</b> board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E

5|$|Wolf named Tom Bass {{director}} of player personnel. Bass had previously served {{as head of}} scouting and defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals, the only team apart from the Buccaneers and Raiders that still maintained a human scouting staff instead of using <b>the</b> <b>computerized</b> services, and the team on whose model the Buccaneers’ expansion strategy was patterned. Bass was Paul Brown’s first coaching hire with the expansion Bengals, and previously had been an assistant under Sid Gillman with the San Diego Chargers, and with Don Coryell at San Diego State. Former McKay assistant and Utah State head coach Phil Krueger {{was added to the}} staff, joined shortly thereafter by USC assistants Wayne Fontes and Willie Brown, as defensive backs and receivers coaches, respectively. Dennis Fryzel, the last University of Tampa head coach, was added to handle special teams. Denver Broncos assistant Jerry Frei was hired as offensive line coach, becoming McKay’s first assistant hired from the professional ranks, and was followed by former New York Jets defensive coordinator Dick Voris, hired initially as defensive line coach. Abe Gibron, former head coach of the Chicago Bears and college teammate of McKay at Purdue, was brought on board as a defensive assistant. The staff was completed with the addition of Atlanta Falcons assistant and former Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills head coach John Rauch as offensive coordinator. Tampa resident Harry Smith, a trainer with experience working with local college athletes such as John Matuszak and Gary Huff, became the team’s strength and conditioning coach.|$|E

25|$|The early {{standalone}} computerised {{reservation system}} began its operation at Secunderabad in July 1989. But, {{with the introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Computerized</b> Passenger Reservation System (PRS) at Secunderabad Station by SCR, from 30 September 1989, the rail reservations at Secunderabad were made easy. This system was later linked to New Delhi, Howrah, Mumbai and Chennai in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 1999 respectively. This version was before the CONCERT system of reservation was developed to interconnect the stations. CONCERT was developed at Secunderabad in September 1994 but the first prototype of the CONCERT passenger reservation system was not implemented at the station until January 1995.|$|E
25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a power pack consisting of a transformer and rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as <b>the</b> <b>computerized</b> controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E

Finally, in despair, Raj asks his parents to find him a potential bride for an arranged marriage. Raj gets along well with his parents' first selection, but discovers that the woman is a lesbian trying to conceal her sexual orientation from her family: she assumes Raj is also homosexual and that they would have a lavender marriage, an idea Raj considers as a viable alternative to lifelong bachelorhood until Howard and Bernadette convince him otherwise.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>computerized</b> FCS of the BMD-4 is {{automated}} by day {{and night}} and features two advanced optical sights for both the commander and gunner. The IFV commander's panoramic sight has an azimuth coverage of 360° to search for targets. This panoramic sight features thermal imaging and range finding channels {{with a range of}} up to 10km. The gunner's sight provides for firing all types of armament {{by day and}} night with a range finding sight of 10km. This sight is combined with visual imaging, thermal imaging, range-finding channels, and a missile guidance channel. With two dedicated sights for both operators of the Bakhcha-U, the BMD-4 has hunter-killer capabilities and the gunner is able to use the commander's sight to engage targets if his own sight is disabled or destroyed. The commander of the vehicle also has the ability to override the command and {{to take control of the}} turret and gun from the gunner with both turret operators having complete control of the armaments.|$|E
