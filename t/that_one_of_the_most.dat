25|$|Economic {{inequality}} affects equity, {{equality of}} outcome and subsequent equality of opportunity. Although earlier studies considered economic inequality as necessary and beneficial, some economists {{see it as}} an important social problem. Early studies suggesting that greater equality inhibits economic growth did not account for lags between inequality changes and growth changes. Later studies claimed <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> robust determinants of sustained economic growth is the level of income inequality.|$|E

Accordingly, the church strongly emphasizes education {{and as part of}} the Church Educational System, subsidizes Brigham Young University (BYU) and its Jerusalem Center, BYU–Idaho, BYU–Hawaii, and LDS Business College.|$|E

25|$|And finally {{when looking}} at the three most {{primitive}} insects with aquatic nymphs (called naiads: Ephemeroptera, Odonata and Plecoptera), each order has its own kind of tracheal gills that are so different from one another that they must have separate origins. This would be expected if they evolved from land-dwelling species. This means <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> interesting parts of insect evolution is what happened between the Thysanura-Pterygota split and the first flight.|$|E

The presence of a significant magnetic field for Uranus was not at all known until Voyager 2s arrival.|$|E

25|$|Later, it {{was noted}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{significant}} characteristics of RISC processors was that external memory was only accessible by a load or store instruction. All other instructions were limited to internal registers. This simplified many aspects of processor design: allowing instructions to be fixed-length, simplifying pipelines, and isolating the logic {{for dealing with the}} delay in completing a memory access (cache miss, etc.) to only two instructions. This led to RISC designs being referred to as load/store architectures.|$|E
25|$|Confucius judged a good ruler by his {{possession}} of de ("virtue"): {{a sort of}} moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others {{without the need for}} physical coercion (Analects 2.1). Confucius said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of de is through a devotion to the correct practices of li. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's de include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.|$|E
25|$|The Emperor of China learns <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{beautiful}} {{things in his}} empire is {{the song of the}} nightingale. When he orders the nightingale brought to him, a kitchen maid (the only one at court who knows of its whereabouts) leads the court to a nearby forest, where the nightingale agrees to appear at court, where it remains as the Emperor's favorite. When the Emperor is given a bejeweled mechanical bird he loses interest in the real nightingale, who returns to the forest. The mechanical bird eventually breaks down; and the Emperor is taken deathly ill a few years later. The real nightingale learns of the Emperor's condition and returns to the palace; whereupon Death is so moved by the nightingale's song that he allows the Emperor to live.|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} in 825 <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{important}} battles in Anglo-Saxon history took place, when Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia at Ellandun—now Wroughton, near Swindon. This battle {{marked the end of}} the Mercian domination of southern England. The Chronicle tells how Ecgberht followed up his victory: [...] "Then he sent his son Æthelwulf from the army, and Ealhstan, his bishop, and Wulfheard, his ealdorman, to Kent with a great troop." [...] Æthelwulf drove Baldred, the king of Kent, north over the Thames, and according to the Chronicle, the men of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex then all submitted to Æthelwulf [...] "because earlier they were wrongly forced away from his relatives." [...] This may refer to Offa's interventions in Kent at the time Ecgberht's father Ealhmund became king; if so, the chronicler's remark may also indicate Ealhmund had connections elsewhere in southeast England.|$|E

In addition to musicians from his touring band, the Neverland Express, several guest players contributed to the album. Meat Loaf says, [...] "I didn't just want to bring in rock players — I wanted to go to extreme rock people" [...] resulting in an album that [...] "has all the touches of the other two Bats, but it's much more of a rock album."

500|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} Fullmetal Alchemists anime adaptations, Edward has been voiced by Romi Park. In the English version, the role has been played by Vic Mignogna. Mignogna {{has stated that}} {{performing}} Edward may be his biggest voice acting achievement since fans do not compare him with Park, noting that their voices are not similar {{and that he did}} not plan to sound like her. Additionally, in the upcoming live-action of the series, Edward will be portrayed by Ryosuke Yamada. Yamada thinks his short starture might be work as an advantage due to one of Edward's most common characteristics is his low height. Studying Arakawa's manga, Yamada tried imitating Edward's other signature actions such the way he runs. A fan of the series, the actor expressed happiness with the role he was given. Nevertheless, in Anime Expo 2017 if anything from him looked [...] "weird" [...] which resulted in praise from the audience. During questions, Yamada said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> difficult scenes about his acting is interacting with Alphonse {{as a result of the}} latter being CGI.
