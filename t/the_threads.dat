5|$|Ptychocysts are {{not used}} for prey capture— instead <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of {{discharged}} ptychocysts are used for building protective tubes in which their owners live. Ptychocysts are found only in the order Ceriantharia, tube anemones.|$|E
5|$|Clotho– The final Sister {{who was the}} {{gigantic}} and grotesque keeper of the loom from which <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of all life are spun. The character was voiced by Susan Silo in God of War II, and Marina Gordon in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. <b>The</b> <b>threads</b> of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>thread</b> 2 has <b>the</b> highest {{priority}} and <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> 3 has <b>the</b> lowest priority. The first message is printed by <b>the</b> middle priority <b>thread</b> 1 {{because it is}} started a short time before <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> 2.|$|R
50|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} the ratio between inertia and viscous effects within <b>the</b> <b>thread.</b> For large Reynolds numbers, {{the effects of}} motion of <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> are much greater than viscous {{dissipation}}. Viscosity only has a minimal damping effect on <b>the</b> <b>thread.</b> For small Reynolds numbers, viscous dissipation is large and any disturbances are rapidly damped from <b>the</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the {{limiting}} {{case where the}} external environment of <b>the</b> fluid <b>thread</b> is much more viscous than <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> itself, <b>the</b> viscosity of <b>the</b> fluid <b>thread</b> falls from <b>the</b> perturbation growth rate completely. The growth rate thus becomes only {{a function of the}} initial radius of <b>the</b> <b>thread,</b> <b>the</b> perturbation wavelength, the surface tension of <b>the</b> <b>thread,</b> <b>the</b> viscosity of the external environment, and the second order Bessel functions of the second kind.|$|R
5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour {{is quite different from}} that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they can}} {{complete}} the mission, Silik is {{killed by a}} guard near the conduit, and Archer is nearly shot by a confused Tucker. With the alien shields down, Enterprise then completes an atmospheric entry, flying over New York City and destroying the alien facility with photon torpedoes. The episode ends with Daniels showing Archer <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of the timeline resetting themselves back to normal, as the Temporal Cold War finally ends {{with the death of}} Vosk. Archer demands that Daniels should never visit or bother Enterprise again. With their mission completed, Enterprise finally arrives back in its proper time period, where the crew are welcomed and escorted by an entire squadron of Starfleet and alien vessels.|$|E
5|$|The film {{included}} several technical errors. Cut-out cardboard pieces {{were used to}} depict military aircraft during battle scenes in the film, and one film critic said viewers were almost able to identify <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> attached to the cardboard cut-outs. Footage of a digital watch was spliced into the film, though this technology would not be invented for twenty-five years after the film's time period. There were other problems. Jacqueline Bisset developed laryngitis during the film's production. A set-piece for the film included a re-created version of a lighthouse at Incheon, but this was obliterated by a typhoon. The death of David Janssen during production called for extensive reshoots.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>threaded</b> {{connectors}} on <b>the</b> hoses are {{handed to}} avoid accidental mis-connection: <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> on <b>the</b> oxygen hose is right-handed (as normal), while the fuel gas hose has a left-handed <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> left-handed <b>threads</b> {{also have an}} identifying groove cut into their nuts.|$|R
5000|$|The pitch {{diameter}} (PD, or D2) {{of a particular}} thread, internal or external, is the diameter of a cylindrical surface, axially concentric to <b>the</b> <b>thread,</b> which intersects <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> flanks at equidistant points, when viewed {{in a cross-sectional plane}} containing the axis of <b>the</b> <b>thread,</b> <b>the</b> distance between these points being exactly one half the pitch distance. Equivalently, a line running parallel to the axis and a distance D2 away from it, the [...] "PD line," [...] slices the sharp-V form of <b>the</b> <b>thread,</b> having flanks coincident with the flanks of <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> under test, at exactly 50% of its height. We have assumed that the flanks have the proper shape, angle, and pitch for <b>the</b> specified <b>thread</b> standard. It is generally unrelated to the major (D) and minor (D1) diameters, especially if the crest and root truncations of the sharp-V form at these diameters are unknown. Everything else being ideal, D2, D, & D1, together, would fully describe <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> form. Knowledge of PD determines the position of <b>the</b> sharp-V <b>thread</b> form, <b>the</b> sides of which coincide with the straight sides of <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> flanks: e.g., <b>the</b> crest of <b>the</b> external <b>thread</b> would truncate these sides a radial displacement D - D2 away from the position of the PD line.|$|R
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E
5|$|The redback {{is mainly}} nocturnal; the female remains {{concealed}} during the day, and spins her web during the night, usually {{remaining in the}} same location {{for most of her}} adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical {{or nearly}} so, reddish-brown, {{thick-walled}} and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7–11µm; the warts are about 1µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, {{and will not}} stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. <b>The</b> <b>threads</b> of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|A denier weight {{specification}} states {{how many}} grams 9,000 meters of <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> weighs. Unlike <b>the</b> common <b>thread</b> weight system, <b>the</b> greater the denier number, <b>the</b> thicker <b>the</b> <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> denier weight system, like the common weight system, also specifies {{the number of}} strands of the specified weight which were wrapped together to make <b>the</b> finished <b>thread.</b>|$|R

5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} {{whether he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. <b>The</b> <b>threads</b> were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in <b>the</b> <b>threads.</b> Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to <b>the</b> <b>threads,</b> and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E
25|$|Connection is then {{established}} between the attenuated rovings and the spindles. When {{the latter are}} bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is put into gear, and the attendants wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed in gear, and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These are attached to <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> on the spindles, by simply placing <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> {{in contact with the}} un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.|$|E
25|$|Racks of bobbins {{are set up}} to hold <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> {{while it}} is rolled onto the warp bar of a loom. Because <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> is fine, often three of these would be {{combined}} to get <b>the</b> desired <b>thread</b> count.|$|R

The Thury numbers were rounded to three significant figures. <b>The</b> Thury <b>thread</b> form had <b>the</b> crests rounded at 1/6p and the roots rounded at 1/5p so <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> angle was close to 47.5 degrees but not exactly. This was simplified in <b>the</b> BA <b>thread</b> definition by defining <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> angle to be 47.5 degrees exactly and <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> form to be symmetrical with a depth of 0.6p.|$|R

50|$|In use {{the blade}} is {{inserted}} into the seam underneath <b>the</b> <b>thread</b> to be cut. <b>The</b> <b>thread</b> is allowed to slip down into the fork and the tool is then lifted upwards allowing the blade to cut through <b>the</b> <b>thread.</b> Once <b>the</b> seam has been undone {{in this way the}} loose ends can be removed and the seam resewn.|$|R
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of post mounts {{is that the}} bolt is threaded directly into the fork lowers. If <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> are stripped or if the bolt is stuck, then <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> {{will need to be}} repaired, or the seized bolt drilled out. Frame manufacturers have standardized the IS mount for the rear disc brake mount. In recent years post mount has gained ground and is becoming more common. This is mostly due to decreased manufacturing and part cost for the brake calipers when using post mount. A limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained: it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations, where the rotor is out of range.|$|E
