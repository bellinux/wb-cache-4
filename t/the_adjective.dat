5|$|Quenya {{allows for}} a very {{flexible}} word order {{because it is an}} inflectional language like Latin. Nevertheless, it has word order rules. The usual syntax structure is subject-verb-object. <b>The</b> <b>adjective</b> can be placed before or after the noun that it modifies.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, <b>the</b> <b>adjective</b> slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of <b>the</b> <b>adjective,</b> e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E

5000|$|In {{definite}} form, {{there is}} instead a weak adjective inflection, originating from a Proto-Germanic nominal derivation of <b>the</b> <b>adjectives.</b> <b>The</b> <b>adjectives</b> now invariably {{take on an}} -a suffix irrespective of case and number, which was not always the case, cf. Proto-Germanic adjectives: ...|$|R

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. <b>The</b> <b>adjective</b> geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from <b>the</b> <b>adjective</b> quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>adjective</b> Angevin is {{especially}} used in English history {{to refer to}} the kings who were also counts of Anjoubeginning with Henry II descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other Counts and Dukes of Anjou; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of Jerusalem and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the Capetian House of Anjou and the Valois House of Anjou.|$|E

50|$|Two or more {{adjectives}} can {{be combined}} into a single word using an о as the linking vowel, for example, сільськогосподарський, which consists of <b>the</b> <b>adjectives</b> сільський and господарський. If <b>the</b> second <b>adjective</b> starts with a vowel, then a dash {{can be used to}} separate the linking vowel and <b>the</b> second <b>adjective,</b> for example, середньо-європеський.|$|R
25|$|Comparative {{adjectives}} {{are formed}} by placing various particles (plu, tam, and min) {{in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>adjective</b> receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles (maxim and minim) precede <b>the</b> <b>adjective.</b> <b>The</b> <b>adjective</b> does not receive an inflection to its ending.|$|E
25|$|Most Russian {{family names}} {{originated}} from patronymics, that is, father's name usually formed by adding <b>the</b> <b>adjective</b> suffix -ov(a) or -ev(a). Contemporary patronymics, however, have a substantive suffix -ich for masculine and <b>the</b> <b>adjective</b> suffix -na for feminine.|$|E
25|$|The {{same holds}} true for Mandarin and Cantonese in that another {{structure}} needs to be used when only one of the nouns being compared is mentioned. Note also that Teochew and Mandarin both use a pre-modifier (before <b>the</b> <b>adjective)</b> while Cantonese uses a post-modifier (after <b>the</b> <b>adjective).</b>|$|E
