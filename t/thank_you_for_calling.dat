40|$|First and {{foremost}} I {{would like to}} thank my family for giving me the support to get to where I am today. Mom, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>calling</b> me twice a week to make sure I was “mentally okay”! Our long talks about life helped me get through one of the toughest times of my life. Dad and Marcia, I {{would like to thank}} you for being there for me when I needed you the most. Grandma, throughout this process I have been thinking about you everyday. Your constant reminders of how proud you are kept me progressing, even through the days which had no light. Stacey, Matt, Jonathan, and Kirsten thank you for your support you have given me through this process. Without your love I would not have gotten this far. To the love of my life, Sarah, thank you for being my backbone throughout this process. You never left my side and always made me smile when I needed it most. You unselfishly put yourself on the backburner so that I could have an affair with my computer! Thank you for your unconditional love and I cannot wait to continue our journey together. To all of my friends (you know who you all are!) for giving me the emotiona...|$|E

5000|$|CALLER: Right. [...] LIMBAUGH: The {{weapons of}} mass destruction. We gotta get beyond that. We're there. We all know they were there, and Mahmoud even {{admitted}} {{it in one of}} his speeches here talking about Saddam using the poison mustard gas or whatever it is on his own people. But that's moot. What's more important is all this is taking place now {{in the midst of the}} surge working, and all of these anti-war Democrats are getting even more hell-bent on pulling out of there, which means that success on the part of you and your colleagues over there is a great threat to them. It's frustrating and maddening, and why they must be kept in the minority. I want to <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> Mike, <b>for</b> <b>calling.</b> I appreciate it very much.|$|R
40|$|God is {{the reason}} why this study is complete. He brought me to this endeavor, and then He brought me through it. I could never thank Him or praise Him enough for the many undeserved gifts He has {{bestowed}} upon me. My three beautiful children, Katherine, Victoria and William, sacrificed more than anyone else during these many years in order for me to pursue my education. I could never truly express to all of you how grateful I am that you are such wonderful, loving children. I had been told that getting a Ph. D. while raising three children alone would be an impossible task; if you all had not been such easy children to raise I could never have done this. I am sorry that you all had to go through so much in this process. I am in constant amazement of the three of you; you are all my heroes. Thank you for your sacrifices, for your patience and for your enduring love. I can only hope that you all see this as an example in perseverance. Thank you to my father who has believed in me from the beginning. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>calling</b> everyday to see if I had completed that “book report ” yet. My answer, finally, is yes! I have completed that book report! I know raising two daughters on your own wasn’t easy; you once told me that if you spent any more time praying for me you would have to quit your job. I know your greatest prayer was that your daughters would be educated. God heard you. Thank you for your love. Thank you to my mother. Although you were not here to see me grow up and accomplish this task, I know you have been watching from heaven, and I know you are proud. Thank you for your love...|$|E

Most importantly, a VERY BIG <b>THANK</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>FOR</b> NOT LETTING ME GIVE UP...|$|R
