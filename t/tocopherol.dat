50|$|Tocotrienols {{are members}} of the vitamin E family: four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and four <b>tocopherols</b> (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). The {{critical}} chemical structura difference between tocotrienols and <b>tocopherols</b> is in that <b>tocopherols</b> have saturated side chains, whereas tocotrienols have unsaturated isoprenoid side chains (farnesyl isoprenoid tails) with three double bonds (see Figure).|$|R
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of <b>tocopherols</b> with 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was studied in model systems {{in order to}} establish a method for quantifying vitamin E in plant oils. The method was optimized with respect to solvent composition of the assay medium, which has a large influence on the course of reaction of <b>tocopherols</b> with DPPH. The rate of reaction of α-tocopherol with DPPH is higher than that of γ-tocopherol in both protic and aprotic solvents. In ethyl acetate, routinely applied for the analysis of antioxidant potential (AOP) of plant oils, reactions of <b>tocopherols</b> with DPPH are slower and concentration of <b>tocopherols</b> in the assay has a large influence on their molar reactivity. In 2 -propanol, however, two electrons are exchanged for both α- and γ-tocopherols, independent of their concentration. 2 -propanol is not toxic and is fully compatible with polypropylene labware. The chromatographically determined content of <b>tocopherols</b> and their molar reactivity in the DPPH assay reveal that only <b>tocopherols</b> contribute to the AOP of sunflower oil, whereas the contribution of <b>tocopherols</b> to the AOP of linseed oil is 75 %. The DPPH assay in 2 -propanol can be applied for rapid and cheap estimation of vitamin E content in plant oils where <b>tocopherols</b> are major antioxidants...|$|R
25|$|<b>Tocopherol,</b> a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds of which many have vitamin E activity, describes a series of organic compounds consisting of various methylated phenols. During feeding experiments with rats Herbert McLean Evans concluded in 1922 that besides vitamins B and C, an unknown vitamin existed. Although every other nutrition was present, the rats were not fertile. This condition could be changed by additional feeding with wheat germ. It took several years until 1936 when the substance was isolated from wheat germ and the formula C29H50O2 was determined by Herbert McLean Evans and K.S. Bishop. The structure was determined shortly thereafter in 1938.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{was carried out}} {{on the effects of}} naturally occurring <b>tocopherols</b> and carotenoids on the stability of biodiesel-grade methyl esters. Commercially available <b>tocopherols</b> and carotenoids, α-, γ- and δ-tocopherol, carotene and asthaxanthin, were added to destabilised methyl esters and the solutions were exposed to air at 65 oC. The stabilising effect of the added <b>tocopherols</b> and carotenoids was determined from the number of days needed to reach the same increase of viscosity as destabilised methyl ester without <b>tocopherols</b> after 1 day. All three <b>tocopherols</b> stabilised methyl esters; γ- being the most effective and α- the least. The stabilising effect of <b>tocopherols</b> increased with concentration up to an optimum level. Concentrations above this level did not improve stability significantly. The stabilising effect of the <b>tocopherols</b> also depended on the composition of the methyl ester; they were most effective in tallow methyl ester, and had the least effect on sunflower methyl ester. Carotene and asthaxanthin had no effect on the stability of the methyl esters. However an unidentified carotenoid in rape methyl ester changed the oxidation pattern by reducing rates of peroxide and viscosity increase, without affecting overall stability.

40|$|In {{marine organisms}} {{primarily}} intended for human consumption, {{the quality of}} the muscle and the extracted oils may be affected by lipid oxidation during storage, even at low temperatures. This has led to a search for alternatives to maintain quality. In this sense, antioxidant compounds have been used to prevent such lipid deterioration. Among the most used compounds are <b>tocopherols,</b> which, due to their natural origin, have become an excellent alternative to prevent or retard lipid oxidation and maintain the quality of marine products. <b>Tocopherols</b> as antioxidants have been studied both exogenously and endogenously. Exogenous <b>tocopherols</b> are often used by incorporating them into plastic packaging films or adding them directly to fish oil. It has been observed that exogenous <b>tocopherols</b> incorporated in low concentrations maintain the quality of both muscle and the extracted oils during food storage. However, {{it has been reported that}} <b>tocopherols</b> applied at higher concentrations act as a prooxidant molecule, probably because their reactions with singlet oxygen may generate free radicals and cause the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oils. However, when <b>tocopherols</b> are included in a fish diet (endogenous <b>tocopherols),</b> the antioxidant effect on the muscle lipids is more effective due to their incorporation into the membrane lipids, which can help extend the shelf life of seafood by reducing the lipid deterioration that occurs due to antioxidant synergy with other phenolic compounds used supplements in fish muscle.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the "in vivo" antioxidant activity of different extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) produced in the Mediterranean area. One hundred and twenty rats were fed diets containing oxidised and refined olive oil (400 mEq O 2 kg) for 11 weeks, a period of time sufficient to induce globular fragility and marginal plasma <b>tocopherols</b> deficiency.

Moreover, globular resistance improved to a different extent with EVOO diets compared to the oxidised oil diet.
