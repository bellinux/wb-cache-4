5|$|After Germany's {{conquest of}} Romania (see Romania during World War I), the German Imperial Navy had {{sufficient}} fuel oil for submarines {{located in the}} Black Sea. UB-44 and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the Allies {{in the middle of}} 1916. UB-44 departed from Cattaro on 8 August for Hersingstand (located on the Gallipoli peninsula) <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> pilot for the trip through the Dardanelles, but never arrived.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the film}} had been {{released}} in Czechoslovakia, Forman sought an international distributor, who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn't have enough nudity in it; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption. One of these scenes, which {{was included in the}} US version, involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda, the pianist, tries <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> buxom girl on the streets of Prague, only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four-story building in which she lives, disturbing the sleeping residents.|$|E

A new church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was consecrated on the site by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 31 July 2005.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Following Miami's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech {{began its}} first {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} game at its 24-yard line. A three-yard rush from fullback Scott Dovel was followed by two rushes from Tech's Cyrus Lawrence: one for eight yards and a second for 17 more. These drove Tech into Miami territory and gave the Hokies a first down. Once there, however, Miami's defense stiffened and Tech was forced to punt. Miami recovered the ball at its 12-yard line, and the Hurricanes began their second possession of the game. Fullback Chris Hobbs and running back Smokey Roan alternated carries, picking up yardage and first downs before entering Virginia Tech territory. On the Hurricanes' first play on Tech's side of the field, however, Miami committed two penalties, pushing the Hurricanes back 20 yards. Following the penalties, Miami was unable <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> first down and punted back to the Hokies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Activities {{that require}} extreme hip {{movement}} can dislocate hip implants {{in the early}} post operative phase. One such activity is retrieving an object from the floor. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess hip movement using four different techniques to accomplish this task. This assessment would identify the techniques least likely to cause a hip dislocation. Methods An electromagnetic tracker was used to measure the movement of 50 hips in 25 normal subjects. Sensors were attached over the iliac crest and the mid-shaft of the lateral thigh. Data was then collected for 3 repetitions of each of the following retrieval techniques:- 1. Flexing forward <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> object between the feet. 2. Flexing <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> object lateral <b>to</b> the foot. 3. Squatting <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> object between the feet. 4. Kneeling on one knee <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> beside the knee. Results Kneeling required a mean movement of 30. 4 degree(s) flexion and 7. 2 degree(s) external rotation. This was significantly less than all the other techniques (paired t-test, P Conclusion The study showed that squatting had the most flexion and internal rotation, whereas kneeling has the least flexion. Thus, to minimise the dislocation risk when retrieving an object from the floor, kneeling should be adopted and squatting should be avoided. </p...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the kick}} {{and a short}} return, Florida State began a drive at the Tech 34-yard line, {{seemingly}} in excellent field position. But on the first play of the State drive, the Seminoles were stopped for a loss. State was able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> short gain on the second play, but on the third, Weinke was sacked {{for the third time}} in the game. After the Seminole punt and a touchback, Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first down with an option run to Stith, then Vick ran for a long gain and another first down at the Florida State 20-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush up the middle of the field, then Vick completed a first-down pass to Derek Carter inside the Seminole 10-yard line. Kendrick advanced the ball to the Seminole three-yard line, then Vick ran the remaining yardage for a touchdown. Following the extra point, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 2814 with 37 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while trying <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing {{each other for the}} division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come out on top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{then decided}} to depart, owing {{to the risk of}} encountering {{superior}} warships. Upon leaving the harbor, he encountered a British freighter, , loaded with ammunition, that had already stopped <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> harbor pilot. While preparing to take possession of the ship, Emden had to recall her boats when she spotted an approaching ship. This proved to be the French destroyer , and the unprepared ship was quickly destroyed. Emden stopped to pick up survivors from Mousquet and departed at around 08:00 as the other French ships were raising steam in preparation to get underway. One officer and thirty-five sailors were plucked from the water. Another French destroyer tried to follow, but lost sight of the German raider in a rainstorm. On 30 October, Emden stopped the British steamer Newburn and put the French sailors aboard her after they signed statements promising not to return to the war. The attack on Penang was a significant shock to the Entente powers, and caused them to delay the large convoys from Australia, since they would need more powerful escorts.|$|E

5|$|On 8 May, Falke {{arrived in}} Port of Spain in Trinidad before being ordered {{to the coast}} of Venezuela to {{safeguard}} German interests {{during a period of}} unrest there.

She then proceeded to La Guaira and Carúpano in Venezuela to protect German nationals from expected fighting, and from June evacuated German and French nationals from the two cities to Saint Thomas. She was based out of the port of Charlotte Amalie in the Virgin Islands. During this period, she made stops in Carúpano, La Guaira, and Puerto Cabello, along with a visit to Willemstad in Curaçao. On 30 September, she was sent to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to protect German nationals there during a revolution in the country. At times, landing parties had to be sent ashore to protect the German consulate in Gonaïves.|$|E

5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature.

Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork.
