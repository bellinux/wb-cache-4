40|$|Mismatch between outer lead bonds (OLBs) of a tape {{automated}} bonding (TAB) and a {{glass panel}} during fabrication is studied using the finite element method. A two-dimensional finite element model for the TAB-on Glass (TOG) connector is presented for determining the deformation of the connector. The deformation of the TOG connector induced by residual thermal stresses are determined via a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the TOG connector is under heat and pressure. <b>The</b> <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>film</b> (ACF) in-between the TAB and glass panel {{is assumed to be}} in a melting condition so that both TAB and glass panel can expand freely. At the second stage, the connector is cooled down to room temperature and the ACF becomes solidified. The deformations of the connector at the two stages are determined in the finite element analysis in which the temperature dependence of material properties is considered. Effects of particular parameters on the mismatch between the OLBs are studied by means of a number of numerical examples. A method for compensation design of the lead locations of the OLBs is proposed. It has been shown that the compensation design can produce results that will avoid the occurrence of unwanted mismatch. 1...|$|E
40|$|To {{fulfill the}} demands of ever {{increasingly}} smaller sizes, lighter weight, and lower price points for optoelectronic products, the size and thickness of each component must as a result be reduced. Since a thinner liquid crystal display (LCD) panel can effectively reduce the thickness of an optoelectronic product, the thickness of a LCD panel is usually thinned out through polishing. However, polishing is likely to produce an uneven surface on the LCD panel {{which can lead to}} incomplete fracturing of <b>the</b> <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>film</b> (ACF), disabling electrical conductivity. This research focuses on the elimination of the influences of uneven LCD panels in the chip on glass (COG) process. In addition to the standard process parameters a thin film of Teflon was inserted between the bonding head and the driving IC to minimize the influences of an uneven LCD panel. Experiments show that a 0. 1 mm thick Teflon film in association with a 290 A degrees C bonding head temperature, a 7 s bonding duration, and a 17 kg bonding pressure, can effectively overcome the influence of an uneven LCD panel with 20 mu m surface roughness.

40|$|In recent years, the {{creation}} of a more economical bumping process has been the focus. One of the most promising technologies is the low-cost stencil printing based flip-chip technology. It consists of electroless Nickel/Gold (Ni / Au) Under Bump Metallurgy (UBM) plated on an Aluminum bond pad, followed by selective solder paste printing, using the stencil mask, on top of the UBM. It eliminates the expensive photolithography with thick photoresist and the usage of vacuum sputtering. Ni/Au UBM is not only important in stencil printed bumping technology, but also widely used in some of the anisotropic conductive flip chip technologies as conductive mini bump for <b>the</b> <b>anisotropic</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>film</b> (ACF). The redistribution (RDL) technology facilitates the adaptation of chips designed for wire bonding to flip chip bonding, and relaxes the otherwise tight wire bond pitch to a loose area array pitch. RDLs are formed by adding passivation and metal layers on the top of die, relocating the pads according to the design rules of the solder bumping process. The basic redistribution process includes both a reroute metal layer and additional dielectric layers. The redistribution metal can be aluminum, copper, or other metals. The choice of the conductive material is determined by the substrate and the electrical requirements of the IC. The most popular dielectrics for redistribution technology are Benzocyclobutene (BCB) and Polyimide (PI). BCB has a number of properties that makes it suitable for thick passivation including low moisture uptake, a low dielectric constant and a high degree of planarization over the topography in IC chips...|$|E

40|$|<b>Anisotropic</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>film</b> (ACF) which {{consists}} of an adhesive epoxy matrix and randomly distributed conductive particles are widely used as the connection material for electronic devices with high I/O counts. However, for the semiconductor industry {{the reliability of the}} ACF is still a major concern {{due to a lack of}} experimental reliability data. This paper reports an investigation into the moisture effects on the reliability of ACF interconnections in the flip-chip-on-flex (FCOF) applications. A macro-micro 3 D finite element modeling technique was used in order to make the multi-length-scale modeling of the ACF flip chip possible. The purposes of this modeling work was to understand the role that moisture plays in the failure of ACF flip chips, and to look into the influence of physical properties and geometric characteristics, such as the coefficient of the moisture expansion (CME), Young's modulus of the adhesive matrix and the bump height on the reliability of the ACF interconnections in a humid environment. Simulation results suggest that moisture-induced swelling of the adhesive matrix is the major cause of the ACF joint opening. Modeling results are consistent with the findings in the experimental work...|$|R
