5000|$|Here tp is the {{duration}} for which B1 is applied, {{also called the}} pulse length. The pulses are labeled by the rotation of M0 which they cause and the direction from which they are coming from, since the microwaves can be phase-shifted from the x-axis on to the y-axis. For example, a +y π/2 pulse means that a B1 field, which has been 90 degrees phase-shifted out of the +x into the +y direction, has rotated M0 by a <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> of π/2, hence the magnetization would end up along the -x-axis. That means the end position of the magnetization vector M0 depends on the length, the magnitude {{and direction of the}} microwave pulse B1. In order to understand how the sample emits microwaves after the intense microwave pulse we {{need to go back to}} the laboratory frame. In the rotating frame and on resonance the magnetization appeared to be stationary along the x or y-axis after the pulse. In the laboratory frame it becomes a rotating magnetization in the x-y plane at the Larmor frequency. This rotation generates a signal which is maximized if the magnetization vector is exactly in the xy-plane. This microwave signal generated by the rotating magnetization vector is called free induction decay (FID) (see page 175 of ref [...] ).|$|E

Arc temperature, velocity, current density, heat flux and gas shear are investigated in the arc region and pool convection and puddle shapes are studied in the weld pool region. The arc temperature at the tungsten electrode is found the maximum with sharp tip and decreases as the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> increases. The arc temperature on the anode (workpiece) surface becomes concentrated with increase in <b>tip</b> <b>angle.</b> The arc velocity and gas shear stress are observed large with sharp tip and decreasing as the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> increases.

40|$|A new imaging {{technique}} is introduced {{which provides a}} series of stimulated echo images progressively weighted with T, relaxation with constant T 2 weighting. The series of Ti-weighted images is acquired during a single imaging sequence {{in a manner similar}} to a conventional Tr-weighted spin-echo imaging sequence. A 90 ” pulse creates transverse magnetization which is phase encoded and stored along the longitudinal axis by a 90 ” storage pulse. The image information is acquired by obtaining a series of stimulated echoes, each following a read pulse, which samples residual longitudinal magnetization not recovered to equilibrium. The tip angles of the read pulses are adjusted to given equal tip-angle weighting for each image. This is accomplished by making the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> of the first read pulse small and increasing the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> of each succeeding pulse, in a recursive manner, so that the last pulse in the series has a <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> of 90 ”.

40|$|Drilling of pre-laminated particleboards is {{a subject}} insufficiently covered by {{dedicated}} research. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to examine the relationship of some key drilling parameters and analyze the variation of the thrust force, torque and surface delamination with the feed per tooth and drill <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> at drilling pre-laminated particleboard. The surface quality was evaluated by the size of delaminations, at the exit side of the drill bit. To assess the defect, two non-dimensional parameters were used: the common delamination factor Fd based on the measurement of diameters of the circle circumscribing the defect and of the processed hole, and a new delamination factor, FdS, proposed by the authors and based on the effective measurements of the defect area with an image processing software. The experiments were performed on a range of feed per tooth rates from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mm and four flat drill tip angles: 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °. The results showed that, a low feed rate generally minimizes both the drilling torque and the thrust force and also the delamination, while a small <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> increases the drilling torque and generally minimizes the thrust force and delamination. The drill with T 30 <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> made exception from this trend, due to its geometry that caused the highest thrust force.

MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Eleven brands of steam-shaped microcatheters and one brand of preshaped microcatheter were evaluated. There were 2 nonreinforced and 10 reinforced devices supported by coils. For evaluation of shapability, the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> of 6 samples of each brand were measured after steam-shaping for 20 seconds with a shaping mandrel bent at a 90 ° or 150 ° angle. The ability to maintain the shaped angle after guidewire insertion stress (durability) was compared by calculation of the change in the <b>tip</b> <b>angle</b> by using 3 samples of each brand.

40|$|In {{designing}} pulses and algorithms for {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, several simplifications to the Bloch equation are used. However, as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging requires higher temporal resolution and faster pulses are used, simplifications such as uniform main field (B 0) strength and uniform radio-frequency (RF) transmit coil field (B 1) strength no longer apply. Ignoring these non-uniformities can cause significant distortions. Accurate {{maps of the}} main and RF transmit coil field inhomogeneity are required for accurate pulse design and imaging. Standard estimation methods yield noisy maps, particularly in image regions having low spin density, and ignore other important factors, such as slice selection effects in B 1 mapping and T 2 effects in B 0 mapping. This thesis uses more accurate signal models for the MR scans to derive iterative regularized estimators that show improvements over the conventional unregularized methods through Cramer-Rao Bound analysis, simulations, and real MR data. In fast MR imaging with long readout times, field inhomogeneity causes image distortion and blurring. This thesis first describes regularized methods for estimation of the off-resonance frequency at each voxel from two or more MR scans having different echo times, using algorithms that decrease monotonically a regularized least-squares cost function. A second challenge is that RF transmit coils produce non-uniform field strengths, so an excitation pulse will produce <b>tip</b> <b>angles</b> that vary substantially over the field of view. This thesis secondly describes a regularized method for B 1 map estimation for each coil and for two or more <b>tip</b> <b>angles.</b> Using these scans and known slice profile, the iterative algorithm estimates both the magnitude and phase of each coil’s B 1 map. To circumvent the challenge in conventional B 1 mapping sequences of an long repetition time, this thesis thirdly describes a regularized method for joint B 1 and T 1 map estimation using a regularized method based on a penalized-likelihood cost function using the steady-state incoherent (SSI) imaging sequence with several scans with varying <b>tip</b> <b>angles</b> or repetition times...|$|R

If the vessel is so heavy that either pontoon is mostly submerged when no lateral force is applied, it will be vulnerable to the pontoon effect. If sufficient lateral force arises (such as wind or shifting load), the vessel can tip enough to submerge one pontoon. At this point, the sunken pontoon will provide no further buoyancy to right the vessel. As the center of buoyancy cannot move further to that side to match the center of gravity, that pontoon will continue sinking. The <b>tipping</b> <b>angle</b> will increase until the vessel capsizes.
