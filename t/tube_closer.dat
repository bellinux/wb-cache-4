40|$|Background: More than 2000 {{different}} congenital cerebral malformations {{have been}} described in the literature, for which several classification systems have been proposed. With the help of these classification systems, it is now possible, with neuroimaging, to time neuroembryologic events. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in particular, is useful in studying these malformations. This study evaluated the pattern of congenital brain malformations in a university referral hospital setting. Patients and Methods: The records of all MRI brain examinations at our hospital {{over a period of}} 3 years for children younger than 15 years of age were reviewed. Cases of congenital cerebral malformations were analyzed by sex, age at presentation, type of congenital cerebral malformation, and other associated congenital cerebral malformations. Results: Of the 808 MR examinations of different parts of the body for children in the study period, 719 (89 &#x 0025;), on 581 patients, were of the brain. Eighty-six children (14. 8 &#x 0025;) were found to have single or multiple congenital brain malformations. In these children, 114 congenital brain malformations were identified, the commonest being cortical migrational defects (25 patients, 22 &#x 0025;), neural tube closure defects (22 patients, 19 &#x 0025;), and corpus callosum dysgenesis (22 patients, 19 &#x 0025;). The least common was vascular malformation. Sixteen patients (18. 6 &#x 0025;) had more than one congenital brain malformation. Conclusion: Neural <b>tube</b> <b>closer</b> defects, cortical migrational abnormalities, and corpus callosum anomalies were the commonest congenital brain malformations, while vascular malformations were the least common. Most of the identified malformations demonstrated the usual pattern, but a few showed unusual patterns and associations...|$|E

50|$|When gas {{pressure}} within {{the middle ear}} is less than atmospheric pressure, the eardrum can become sucked into the middle ear space. This is caused by inadequate opening of the Eustachian tube and absorption of air from the middle ear space.

50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} this boiler are its 'thimble tubes'. These are short horizontal water <b>tubes,</b> <b>closed</b> {{at one end and}} tapered. They are thus similar to the field-tube boiler, which also uses single-ended <b>closed</b> <b>tubes,</b> but with important differences. The field-tube boiler uses downward-pointing vertical tubes and these also have an internal tube. This extra tube segregates the flow into a central cold downcomer and an upwelling outer flow of heated water and boiling steam. In the thimble tube, there is no such segregation and so boiling is a random process with flow back and forth along the tube.|$|R
40|$|A superconducting tube {{can be used}} as an {{efficient}} magnetic shield. However, the shielding factor (defined as the ratio between the applied magnetic induction and the magnetic induction measured inside the tube) decreases towards tube extremities because of the field penetration through the open ends of the tube. To improve the performances at tube extremities, the <b>tube</b> should be <b>closed.</b> This can be achieved by using a superconducting vessel or by closing both extremities with a cap. The purpose of the present work is to study experimentally the shielding performances of a Bi 2223 <b>tube</b> <b>closed</b> by a superconducting Bi 2223 cap. The cap is a circular plate with a diameter equal to the outer diameter of the tube and there is no superconducting joint between the cap and the tube. Our interest is to characterize the effect of the cap on the shielding factor distribution along the tube axis when only one extremity of the <b>tube</b> is <b>closed.</b> We also study the effect of the gap size between the cap and the tube in axial configuration. Finally, a <b>tube</b> <b>closed</b> at its both ends is also characterized. All experiments are carried out at 77 K. The tube is subjected to a quasi-static (“DC”) uniform magnetic field. A Hall probe measures the three components of the local magnetic induction along the axis of the tube {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic induction. Results show that the shielding performances in the axial configuration are highly improved at the closed extremity as the cap reduces the penetration through the open end. The shielding factor distribution along the tube axis is affected by the presence of the cap. For an open tube, the shielding factor is maximum near the center and decreases towards both extremities. For the <b>tube</b> <b>closed</b> at one extremity, the shielding factor is maximum at the closed extremity and decreases towards the center. Moreover, the shielding factor distribution between the tube center and the open extremity is not affected by the presence of the cap. The experimental results show that, a small gap between the tube and the cap, which can be necessary for applications, does not strongly affect the magnetic shielding performances of the assembly...|$|R
