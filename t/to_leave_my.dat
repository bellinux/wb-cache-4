500|$|It {{was during}} Abbot Pescall's tenure, in 1530, that Cardinal Thomas Wolsey visited the abbey. Wolsey was an {{influential}} {{minister in the}} government of King Henry VIII. He fell from favour after failing to secure papal permission for Henry to divorce his wife Katherine of Aragon, and on 4 November 1530 was arrested for treason. While en route from Yorkshire to London, where Wolsey would be held prisoner, he fell ill. The journey took Wolsey through Leicester, and he arrived at the abbey on 26 November, declaring: [...] "Father abbott, I ame come hether <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> bones among you". Wolsey died on 30 November and the public were allowed to view his remains before he was interred within the abbey's church.|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Red 2, Zeta-Jones {{took another}} sabbatical from acting, saying: [...] "If I'm going <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> family {{for any length}} of time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [...] I would prefer to stay at home". She found the role {{opposite}} Bill Nighy and Toby Jones in the British war comedy film Dad's Army (2016), based on the television sitcom of the same name. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in Walmington-on-Sea. Catherine Bray of Variety found the film to be an [...] "amiable but creaky resurrection" [...] of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones [...] "hits the required single note with some spirit" [...] she was [...] "generally underused" [...] in it. Zeta-Jones returned to television the following year by portraying the actress Olivia de Havilland in the first season of Ryan Murphy's anthology drama series Feud, subtitled Bette and Joan, about the rivalry between the actresses Joan Crawford and Bette Davis (played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon, respectively). Dominic Patten of Deadline.com found Zeta-Jones to be [...] "wonderfully cast" [...] and Sonia Saraiya of Variety praised her for providing [...] "the best turn in the show". Displeased with an [...] "unauthorized use of her name and identity" [...] in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of Feud for invasion of privacy and other personality rights.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1867, Stowe {{followed}} {{her son to}} Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her {{to spend more time}} on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once, writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become [...] "young & frisky". She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about [...] across the St. Johns River. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe {{fell in love with a}} cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking [...] "How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?" [...] She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: [...] "I hate <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> calm isle of Patmos—where the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing. [...] Emerson could insulate himself here and keep his electricity. [...] Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today showed {{appreciation}} for [...] "I Was Here": [...] "At 29, the still-in-her-prime Beyoncé {{seems a little}} young to be worrying about her legacy, as she does on the Warren power ballad I Was Here. But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album's most moving song." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

2500|$|By the 1560s Lassus {{had become}} quite famous, and composers {{began to go}} to Munich to study with him. Andrea Gabrieli went there in 1562, and {{possibly}} remained in the chapel for a year. Giovanni Gabrieli also possibly studied {{with him in the}} 1570s. His renown had spread outside of strictly musical circles, for in 1570 Emperor Maximilian II conferred nobility upon him, a rare circumstance for a composer. Pope Gregory XIII knighted him and in 1571, and again in 1573, the king of France, Charles IX, invited him to visit. Some of these kings and aristocrats attempted to woo him away from Munich with more attractive offers, but Lassus was evidently more interested in the stability of his position, and the splendid performance opportunities of Albrecht's court, than in financial gain. [...] "I do not want <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> house, my garden, and the other good things in Munich", he wrote to the Duke of Electorate of Saxony in 1580, upon receiving an offer for a position in Dresden.|$|E
