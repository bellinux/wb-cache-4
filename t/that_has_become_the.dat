5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, cocoa and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} cocoa producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the cocoa capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. Cocoa production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both cocoa and palm oil are part of the large agriculture sector <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> main income producer for the town.|$|E

The Dime Savings Bank, as it was originally known, was organized in 1884 {{by a group of}} Detroit businessmen including J. L. Hudson and James E.

All six crewmen survived the crash, but two later succumbed to exposure and drowned. Despite the relative shallowness of the water, the aircraft was never recovered.

25|$|The logical {{extension}} of positron instrumentation was a design using two 2-dimensional arrays. PC-I {{was the first}} instrument using this concept and was designed in 1968, completed in 1969 and reported in 1972. The first applications of PC-I in tomographic mode as distinguished from the computed tomographic mode were reported in 1970. It soon became clear to many {{of those involved in}} PET development that a circular or cylindrical array of detectors was the logical next step in PET instrumentation. Although many investigators took this approach, James Robertson and Zang-Hee Cho were the first to propose a ring system <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> prototype of the current shape of PET.|$|E
25|$|Klein's {{synthesis}} of geometry as {{the study of}} the properties of a space that is invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the Erlangen Program (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was set out in Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified approach to geometry <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> accepted modern view. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of transformations that preserve those properties. Thus the program's definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.|$|E

In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the 25 Must See Bollywood Films, citing it as a [...] "trendsetter of sorts". In that same year's retrospective review by Rediff, Raja Sen stated that Kajol was [...] "wisely picked ... to play Simran, the real-as-life actress bringing warmth and credulity to the initially prudish and reluctant Simran.

500|$|Similar to {{previous}} Saints Row series games, Saints Row IV {{is an open}} world action game with third-person shooter elements wherein the player is free to explore the environment and, at their leisure, play story or side missions. As {{the leader of the}} Saints, a street gang <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> world's most [...] "powerful and popular" [...] organization, the player is elected President of the United States, receives superpowers, and fends off an alien invasion. Most often the player will engage in shooting and racing activities, though other activities vary from fighting crowds of zombies, shoot-outs in tanks, side-scrolling brawlers, fights against supersized, daikaiju energy drink cans, and using a dubstep gun to interrupt 1950s Americana. The player-character receives elemental powers and superpowers that greatly increase their jump height and running speed, such that the player can hop over buildings and outrun vehicles. The elemental powers include abilities to shoot fire and ice projectiles, telekinetically toss things, and create shockwaves upon landing jumps. [...] As the player progresses through the game, they can optionally upgrade their abilities and weapons skill tree by using collectible [...] "data clusters" [...] scattered around town. If the player becomes too rowdy, the alien race's police analogue will intervene. As in previous games, the player-character's look and feel is entirely customizable via a robust character editor feature.|$|E
