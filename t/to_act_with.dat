5|$|Andjar {{was born}} Abisin Abbas in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26February 1902. He gravitated toward {{traditional}} theatre {{at a young}} age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he pretended <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> his friends in stage plays which they had seen. After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school) level– first in Malay-language schools then Dutch ones– he moved to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a farm.|$|E
5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{performed}} his Army tasks but {{was unhappy}} with the narrowly defined role. He tendered his resignation on December 31, 1870. Through President Grant, he went to Marseilles and Rome as an American vice-consul. In 1871, Savage traveled to Egypt <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> the rank of captain for one year as secretary to Charles Pomeroy Stone, a former American general in the Egyptian Army, serving under Khedive Isma'il Pasha. Following an honorable discharge from the Egyptian Army, Savage returned to the U.S. and was tasked by Grant to serve as one of three commissioners investigating a series of border incidents between the U.S. and Mexico 1872–74. At the same time, he worked with Richard King and the nascent Corpus Christi & Rio Grande Railroad as chief surveyor for the route to Laredo.|$|E

5|$|Spurred by the crisis, on 1 April 286, Maximian took up {{the title}} of Augustus. His {{appointment}} is unusual {{in that it was}} impossible for Diocletian to have been present to witness the event. It has even been suggested that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion is unpopular, as it is clear that Diocletian meant for Maximian <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> a certain amount of independence. It may be posited, however, that Diocletian felt the need to bind Maximian closer to him, by making him his empowered associate, {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of having him striking some sort of deal with Carausius.|$|E
5|$|Walter held a legateship from Pope Celestine III from 1195 to 1198, {{which enabled}} him <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> the pope's {{delegated}} authority within the English Church. Walter actively investigated ecclesiastical misconduct, and deposed several abbots, including Robert of Thorney Abbey in 1195 and an abbot of St Mary's {{in the province}} of the Archbishop of York. At the monastic cathedral of Worcester, he disciplined the monks between the death of Henry de Sully and the election of John of Coutances, as was his right as the archbishop of the province. In his own diocese, he granted markets and fairs to towns, was granted the privilege of minting coins at Shrewsbury, and worked to recover lands and manors that had been lost to the archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E

The crime was replaced with a new one under the same name but now applicable <b>to</b> sexual <b>acts</b> <b>with</b> minors below 14, however prosecuteable not more by legal guardians but by the State (according to the new Article 225 of the Penal Code).|$|R

5|$|The Privy Council's primary {{function}} was judicial, {{but it also}} acted as a body of advisers to the king {{and as a result}} its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarchy. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> royal authority. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law. After James VI's departure to England in 1603, it functioned as a subservient executive carrying out his instructions from London. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state. Before 1610 the council was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reorganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the Council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661. After the Restoration, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council was abolished after the Act of Union on 1 May 1708.|$|E

25|$|Coleridge also faced {{personal}} {{challenges in}} carrying out the scheme. He {{received a letter from}} Mary Evans which argued against the plan, and his feelings for her for a time swayed him against Pantisocracy. Learning that she had become engaged, Coleridge turned his attention back to Pantisocracy and Sara Fricker. Under pressure from Southey <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>with</b> regard to Sara (both because of the demands of Pantisocracy and also because she was being courted by other men), Coleridge married Sara in October 1795.|$|E
