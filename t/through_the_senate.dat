5|$|The Senate {{proposed}} to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, {{that he once}} again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Octavian was able to continue {{the appearance of a}} still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.|$|E

5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> {{practically}} without a problem, but objections {{of the proposal}} increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not benefit from it. Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E
5|$|In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held {{just before}} the armistice, Republicans {{narrowly}} {{took control of the}} Senate. Harding was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, confident that he could force what became the Treaty of Versailles <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> by appealing to the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round-robin letter opposing the League. When Wilson invited the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated President in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.|$|E

25|$|The omnibus bill, despite Clay's efforts, {{failed in}} a crucial vote on July 31 with the {{majority}} of his Whig Party and many Southern Democrats opposed. Clay announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to persevere and pass each individual part of the bill. Clay was physically exhausted; the tuberculosis that would eventually kill him had begun to take its toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in Newport, Rhode Island. Douglas separated the bills and guided them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Each individual bill managed to pass, because it had the support not only of moderates, but of either the pro-slavery or anti-slavery senators, depending on who the bill was meant to favor. Combined, these two groups were able to crush the third.|$|E
25|$|In the {{background}} of the formation of this alliance were the frictions between two political factions of the Late Republic, the populares (in favour of the people) and optimates (the good men). The former drew support from the plebeians (the commoners, the majority of the population). Consequently they espoused policies addressing the problems of the urban poor and promoted reforms that would help them, particularly redistribution of land for the landless poor and farm and debt relief. It also challenged the power the nobiles (the aristocracy) exerted over Roman politics <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate,</b> which was the body that represented its interests. The Optimates were a conservative faction that favoured the nobles. They opposed reforms. This faction also wanted to limit the power of the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) and the Plebeian Council (the assembly of the plebeians) and strengthen the power of the senate. Julius Caesar was a leading figure of the populares. The origin of the process that led to Caesar seeking the alliance with Pompey and Crassus traces back to the Second Catilinarian conspiracy, which occurred three years earlier in 63 BC when Marcus Tullius Cicero was one of the two consuls.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was buried}} in his family {{cemetery}} (which, although {{it is part of}} the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park in Stonewall, Texas, is still privately owned by the Johnson family, who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery), a few yards from the house in which he was born. Eulogies were given by former Texas governor John Connally and the Rev. Billy Graham, the minister who officiated at the burial rites. The state funeral, the last for a president until Ronald Reagan's in 2004, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, as the Military District of Washington (MDW) dealt with its second major task in less than a week, beginning with Nixon's second inauguration. The inauguration affected the state funeral in various ways, because Johnson died only two days after the inauguration. The MDW and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration, to allow for a full state funeral, and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral. It also meant Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps.|$|E

25|$|Under the Fiscal Year 2010 budget resolution, {{the text}} of the {{reconciliation}} bill submitted to the Budget Committee had to have been reported by the relevant Committees by October 15, 2009. Therefore, the Democrats combined {{the text of}} America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 as reported out of the Ways and Means Committee, and as it was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee, and {{the text of the}} Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act as reported out of the Education and Labor Committee. This version was never meant to be passed; it was only created so that the reconciliation bill would comply with the Budget resolution. The bill was automatically amended to the version that was meant to be passed per the special rule that was reported out of the Rules Committee. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act was added to the Reconciliation Act as only one reconciliation bill can be passed each budget year, and it also faced a tough road <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> due to Republican filibuster and opposition from several centrist Democratic Senators. The move was also thought to give President Obama two key victories in overhauling the health care and student loan system. It also eventually became clear that the budget savings caused by the student loan bill would become essential to the overall reconciliation bill by reducing the deficit enough for the overall bill to qualify for the reconciliation process.|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all."

500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{the topic of}} civil rights was coming to {{national}} prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders. [...] In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years. [...] The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days. [...] Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. [...] Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964 presidential election, and Humphrey became Vice President of the United States. [...] Governor Karl Rolvaag (DFL) appointed Walter Mondale to fill Humphrey's Senate seat. [...] Humphrey voiced doubts about the 1965 bombings of North Vietnam, which alienated him from Johnson. [...] He later defended Johnson's conduct of the Vietnam War, alienating himself from liberals, who were beginning to oppose the war around 1967. [...] In the 1968 presidential election, Humphrey ran against Richard Nixon and Independent candidate George Wallace and lost the popular vote by only 0.7%. [...] Humphrey later returned to the Senate in 1971 after Eugene McCarthy left office.|$|E
