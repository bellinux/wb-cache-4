40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue that Christopher Kutz misapplies {{his theory of}} joint action when he {{attributes}} shareowners responsibilities {{on the basis of}} <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the corporations in which they invest. Instead I propose that his theory of joint action should be used to attribute shareowners responsibilities on the basis of <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the stock market. If shareholders’ accountability is grounded <b>in</b> <b>their</b> intentional <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the stock market, then shareholders cannot take responsibility for corporation’s individual actions. Instead they are solely responsible for the benefits they gain from holding shares if these are a result of moral wrongdoing and for this they should be held accountable...|$|R

5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement.

5|$|Both teams {{received}} significant financial {{rewards for}} reaching the Champions League final. However, despite losing the match, it was Manchester United who earned {{the most money}} from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281million compared to Barcelona's €30.968million. All 32 teams in the group stage of the competition received €3million for {{taking part in the}} competition and €2.4million for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (€600,000 for each win and €300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of €2.7million, while Manchester United earned €2.4million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of €7.7million for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of €7million for winning the final, while Manchester United received €4million for finishing as runners-up. The biggest difference between the teams' financial rewards came {{as a result of their}} share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (€18.781million) of approximately €55.5million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in La Liga the previous season, and so received the second-smallest share of the €33.8million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home €8.168million.|$|E

5|$|Commissioned only a {{few years}} before the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had limited service careers. All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912. In 1913, they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915, the three Radetzky-class ships bombarded coastal targets in the Adriatic Sea. After 1915, <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the war became minimal.

5|$|Due to the {{continued}} efforts of U.S. Chess Federation officials, a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands, {{in which it was}} accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32. FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion. In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.|$|E

5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive. In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for <b>their</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E
