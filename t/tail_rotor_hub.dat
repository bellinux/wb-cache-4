50|$|In 2012, AgustaWestland {{stated that}} they were {{planning}} to produce the AW169 in their facilities in Yeovil, England; the design and manufacture of various components such as the rotor blades, intermediate and tail gearboxes, and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> has been performed by AgustaWestland's UK branch. In January 2015, the assembly of the first production AW169s began at AgustaWestland's factory in Vergiate, Italy; initial production models were produced at this site. In 2015, manufacturing activity on the AW169 also commenced on a second production line at AgustaWestland's facility in Philadelphia, USA; the rate of production is reportedly planned to be increased to 20 US-built rotorcraft per year by 2017. However, in October 2016, {{it was announced that}} Leonardo, the rebranded identity of AgustaWestland, had decided to abandon work on its planned US production of the type.|$|E
50|$|The Safari is a two-seat light {{helicopter}} with {{a bubble}} canopy, a two-bladed main rotor and a skid landing gear. The aircraft structure consists predominantly of welded 4130 chromoly steel tubing.

40|$|A ground {{vibration}} test {{was performed on}} the AH- 64 (Apache) helicopter to determine the frequency response of the airframe. The structure was excited at both the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hubs,</b> separately, and response measurements were taken at 102 locations throughout the fuselage structure. Frequency responses were compared and correlated with results from a NASTRAN finite element model of AH- 64. In addition, natural frequencies and mode shapes were estimated from the frequency response data and were correlated with analytical results...|$|R

5000|$|Upon its {{entry to}} service, the AW101 {{experienced}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> cracking issues; including one British Merlin crashing on 30 March 2004 which {{was caused by}} this issue. The CH-149 Cormorant has been grounded and been placed on limited flight status multiple times due to hub cracks; all 15 aircraft in Canadian inventory showed cracks of varying degrees shortly after entry to service in 2004. A subsequent redesign was issued in 2005; out of the six aircraft which had the new hubs installed, three showed cracking one month later. A new Articulated Tail Rotor (ATR) with elastometric bearings has been adopted on the AW101, based on a proven design used on the AW139 medium-twin helicopter. The ATR is now standard issue on new AW101s and is offered for retrofit on existing fleets.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a simple but}} {{effective}} methodology for the defect tolerant assessment of a structural component is presented. The methodology {{is based on the}} experimental evidences available in literature that at the fatigue limit non-propagating cracks are observed near defects present in the metallic material. The evaluation of the threshold stress intensity range of these short cracks allows to calculate a safety factor with respect to their propagation. The methodology is applied to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> of a helicopter. The complex geometry and load conditions make this component very interesting for the defect tolerance assessment. The application to an engineering problem allows to describe the difficulties that arise in this process and to show the possible solutions that can be adopted...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is one of the}} first {{attempts}} to exploit the GOAHEAD data base to perform a code-tocode evaluation on complete helicopter aerodynamics. The numerical results of two GOAHEAD partners, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi) are presented and compared to experimental measurements. The study also addresses an evaluation of two different approaches to predict helicopter flows. The first, applied by DLR, accounts for rotor trim and elastic effects by weak fluid–structure coupling. The PoliMi approach, on the other hand, enforces a prescribed kinematics, taken directly from the experiment, on a rigid blade. The simulations refer to a complete helicopter wind– tunnel model, featuring a scaled NH 90 fuselage, the ONERA 7 AD main rotor, a scaled BO 105 <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> a <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> and a pylon, all located inside the 8 m × 6 m test section of the DNW low-speed wind tunnel. The flight conditions correspond to cruise flight at Ma = 0. 204 and fuselage attitude α = − 2. 5 ◦. The comparisons demonstrate the capability of present unsteady RANS solvers to predict flow fields around complete helicopters...|$|R
25|$|The Bell 427 {{is powered}} by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207D {{turboshaft}} engines with FADEC. Like the Bell 407, the 427 uses a four-blade main rotor system with a rigid, composite <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> and a two-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R
25|$|The OH-1 {{is powered}} by a pair of Mitsubishi TS1 {{turboshaft}} engines, equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC), which drives a four-blade composite main rotor with a bearingless <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> along with a Fenestron-type anti-torque <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> (an enclosed tail-fan unit). The Fenestron uses eight asymmetrically-spaced blades to reduce both noise and vibration.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the debris}} was {{contained}} in the dairy farm where the helicopter crashed. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was discovered one block east of the crash site in a used truck yard. A mechanical failure in the helicopter’s main <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> caused one of the rotor blades to detach and it sliced into the fuselage.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the wakes of the main <b>rotor,</b> <b>hub,</b> and fuselage, and with the engine exhaust. Both harmonic and broadband noise were analyzed. The disturbed flow into the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was modeled using combinations of aerodynamic and acoustic flow codes along with some necessary estimates of turbulence properties. Representative calculations show that the main rotor wake is the strongest contributor to both harmonic and broadband <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise. The fuselage separation wake and the engine exhaust flow are also very important to both harmonic and broadband noise. The hub and hub-shaft wakes are important contributors to the broadband noise only. The tip vortices {{do not seem to}} be important to broadband noise, but their effects on harmonic noise were not modeled accurately enough to draw any conclusions from this study...|$|R
40|$|The Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA) {{was flown}} in the {{airplane}} configuration. Eleven successful flights {{were made from}} May 8 to October 3, 1984. The takeoff and landing method was demonstrated and the resultant parameters were obtained. Control power data were obtained. In addition, main <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> drag, airplane configuration acoustics data, and aircraft stability data were obtained. Hub drag, acoustics, and stability will be separately reported in more detail. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was installed for all tests...|$|R
2500|$|Cantinieau {{went to the}} Société Matra {{to build}} a two seat development, the MC-101. [...] This was also an open steel tube design, more complex {{particularly}} in the tail boom, though the undercarriage was reduced to simple skids [...] apart. [...] It had a [...] Hirth HM-504 engine, enclosed in a long, smooth nosed but partially open sided cowling, driving the oscillating <b>rotor</b> <b>hub</b> via a 41:6 reduction gearbox, clutch and Paulstra universal joint. The rotor blades were machined from duralumin. A three blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> was driven via another Paulstra joint and cardan shaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{propulsion}} system was unusual. Two General Electric J35 turbojet engines were used, sending bleed air {{up through the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>hub.</b> The blades were hollow, and the hot compressed air traveled through the blades to tip jets where fuel was injected. In flight, the rotors spun at a sedate 88 rpm. Since the rotor was driven at the tips rather than the hub, little torque compensation was required. Thus, the XH-17 had a very small <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> compared to its main rotor. This drive system was inefficient, limiting the test aircraft {{to a range of}} only 40 mi.|$|R
2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed semi-rigid, teetering {{rotor system}} is being {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, hingeless, bearingless composite rotor system. The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The rotor system has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub.</b> The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and drive system.|$|R
40|$|Variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{speed is}} {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> In hover, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Reducing the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is ineffective for power reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R
40|$|A {{model test}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of aerodynamic interaction between main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and vertical fin on helicopter performance and noise in hover out of ground effect. The experimental data were obtained from hover tests performed with a. 151 scale Model 222 main <b>rotor,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and vertical fin. Of primary interest was the effect of location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> with respect to the main rotor. Penalties on main rotor power due to interaction with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> ranged up to 3 % depending upon <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> location and orientation. Penalties on <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power due to fin blockage alone ranged up to 10 % for pusher <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> and up to 50 % for tractor <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> The main rotor wake had only a second order effect on these tail rotor/fin interactions. Design charts are presented showing the penalties on main rotor power as a function of the relative location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{failures}} which occur {{from either}} a mechanical malfunction of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> control system or {{a loss of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust authority, called [...] "loss of tail-rotor effectiveness" [...] (LTE).|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{drive system}} {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in forward flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recent {{technology}} in emergency <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> recovery systems has been advanced by the US Army in an SBIR research award to EATTS. The emergency anti-torque thruster system (EATTS) {{would allow a}} helicopter that has encountered <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure, or loss of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness, to land safely. The system is designed to counteract the torque from the helicopter's main <b>rotor</b> system during <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure {{as a result of}} mechanical problems as well as loss of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> from RPG hits.|$|R
50|$|When the {{trailing}} vortices colliding with the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are rotating {{in the same}} direction, this causes a loss of thrust from the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> When {{the trailing}} vortices rotate {{in the opposite direction}} of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> thrust is increased. Use of the foot pedals is required to adjust the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor's</b> angle of attack, to compensate for these instabilities.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an ongoing effort {{to model the}} {{interaction}} aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter in subsonic flow are presented. The configurations studied are a) a two-blade main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover, and b) a four-blade main- and a two-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in climb flight. The numerical approach consists of computing the unsteady pressure on the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade surface with a 3 -D unsteady free wake panel method and using this as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equation based aeroacoustic code to evaluate the noise characteristics. Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> axis {{and the sense of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> rotation.

40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a {{helicopter}} with a single main rotor configuration can experience {{a significant reduction in}} thrust when the aircraft operates in crosswind flight. Brown’s vorticity transport model has been used to simulate a main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system translating at a sideslip angle that causes the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to interact with the main rotor tip vortices as they propagate downstream at the lateral extremities of the wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is shown to exhibit a distinct directionally dependent mode during which <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> that are configured so that the blades travel forward {{at the top of the}} disk develop less thrust than <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> with the reverse sense of rotation. The range of flight speeds over which this mode exists is shown to vary considerably with the vertical location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> At low flight speeds, the directionally dependent mode occurs because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within not only the downwash from the main rotor but also the rotational flow associated with clusters of largely disorganized vorticity within the main rotor wake. At higher flight speeds, however, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within a coherent supervortex that strongly influences the velocity field surrounding the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} the effects of mass and stiffness imbalance in a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> induced by damage in forward flight. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis based on finite element {{in space and time}} and capable of modeling dissimilar blades is carried out to study the effect of damage occurring in one, two, and three blades in a four-bladed <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system in forward flight. The effect of damage growth on vibratory hub loads and blade responses is studied using a comprehensive aeroelastic code. Findings – The diagnostic chart which is the summary of damage analysis of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> shows that the root hub vibration spectrum gives enough indication to predict damage growth in the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade. Hence, this can be useful towards development of health monitoring system for <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blades. Originality/value – The proposed analysis helps in understanding the basic physics behind the damaged <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and also gives qualitative assessment of damaged <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> where obtaining the flight test data with damaged <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is difficult...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the main rotor tip vortices, and with the fuselage separation mean wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-main rotor tip vortex interaction is modelled as an airfoil of infinite span cutting through a moving vortex. The vortex and the geometry information required by the analyses are obtained through a free wake geometry analysis of the main rotor. The acoustic pressure-time histories for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-vortex interactions are then calculated. These acoustic results are compared to <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> loading and thickness noise, and {{are found to be}} significant to the overall <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise generation. Under most helicopter operating conditions, large acoustic pressure fluctuations can be generated due to a series of skewed main rotor tip vortices passing through the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> disk. The noise generation depends strongly upon the helicopter operating conditions and the location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> relative to the main rotor...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{is powered}} by the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed {{proportional}} {{to that of the}} main rotor. In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, the main <b>rotor</b> and the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows the rotors to keep turning {{in the event of an}} engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R

The unsteady pressure on the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> surfaces is computed with an unsteady 3 -D panel method with full-span free wake simulation of the simultaneously rotating rotor. The computed pressures serve as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings-equation based acoustic code to evaluate the noise characteristics. For the hover configuration, the parameters varied were {{the distance between the}} rotor axes and the sense of rotation of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Presence of the main rotor has a significant effect on the noise directivity and noise level of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Noise contribution of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> dominates during the climb...|$|R
5000|$|Quadcopters {{differ from}} {{conventional}} helicopters, which use rotors that {{are able to}} vary the pitch of their blades dynamically as they move around the <b>rotor</b> <b>hub.</b> In the early days of flight, quadcopters (then referred to either as 'quadrotors' or 'helicopters') were seen as possible solutions to some of the persistent problems in vertical flight. Torque-induced control issues (as well as efficiency issues originating from the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> which generates no useful lift) can be eliminated by counter-rotation, and the relatively short blades are much easier to construct. A number of manned designs appeared in the 1920s and 1930s. These vehicles were among the first successful heavier-than-air vertical take off and landing (VTOL) vehicles. [...] However, early prototypes suffered from poor performance, and latter prototypes required too much pilot work load, due to poor stability augmentation and limited control authority.|$|R
40|$|Balancing is a {{rotating}} component {{is critical in}} any mechanism. Devoid of proper balancing, any vehicle-be it in air, land or sea, it will affect stability, control and safety. The same goes for rotor crafts. Imbalance of the helicopter <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system leads to vibrations in the entire vehicle and may cause accident. Typically, for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter, the blade {{is a source of}} vibration on the tail boom.

50|$|Based on {{the success}} of Harbin Z-9 and HC120, fenestron {{configuration}} was originally adopted for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> However, due to the inherent disadvantages of the design, such as higher power requirement, higher construction and maintenance cost, higher resistance and weight, fenestron design was dropped after test flights, and a more conventional <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> configuration was adopted. The 4-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is similar to the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of AH-64, with two pairs at unequal distance instead of 4 blades at the equal distance, and one of the main purposes of such arrangement was to reduce noise.
