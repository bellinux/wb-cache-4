You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere him that I just saw a {{minefield}} of disappointment.

500|$|Stephenson {{incorporates}} 17th century sentence {{structure and}} orthography throughout Quicksilver, most apparent in {{his use of}} italicization and capitalization. He adapts a combination of period and anachronistic language throughout the books, mostly to good effect, while allowing diction from modern usage, such as [...] "canal rage" [...] an allusion to road rage. Stephenson chose not to adapt period language for the entire text; instead he allowed such language to enter his writing when it was appropriate, often turning to modern English and modern labels for ideas familiar to modern readers. Stephenson said [...] "I never tried to entertain the illusion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write something that had {{no trace of the}} 20th or the 21st century in it." ...|$|E

[...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me.

500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... {{there was a point}} where I made the decision, and told Joe, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take my name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and I have a lot of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E

By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about.

500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E

[...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E

500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing.

500|$|Not all {{reaction}} to Wagner was positive. For a time, German musical life {{divided into two}} factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of Johannes Brahms; the latter, {{with the support of}} the powerful critic Eduard Hanslick (of whom Beckmesser in Meistersinger is in part a caricature) championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations. They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the conservatories at Leipzig under Ignaz Moscheles and at Cologne under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller. Another Wagner detractor was the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan, who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner's Paris concert on 25 January 1860 at which Wagner conducted the overtures to Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser, the preludes to Lohengrin and Tristan und Isolde, and six other extracts from Tannhäuser and Lohengrin: [...] "I had imagined <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz... I do not like all the music of Berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects... but here he was imitated and caricatured... Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be on The Simpsons, I think {{that was the first time}} that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E
