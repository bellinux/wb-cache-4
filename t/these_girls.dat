5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease <b>these</b> <b>girls,</b> deep down he is nice to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Mick and Tina go to Babe's house to confront her, as Stan's ashes have been {{replaced}} by custard powder, only to be greeted by a man who says that Babe has moved to Ramsgate. Along with Shirley, they track Babe down to a caravan in Ramsgate, where Babe states she was evicted from her house. Later, Shirley discovers a scrapbook of photos of young pregnant girls with due dates written on the back and realises that Babe and Queenie had kidnapped <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> and had their babies adopted out. Shirley is disgusted by Babe's actions and threatens to set her fire to her caravan, but Mick stops her. However, Babe burns the caravan down herself, realising that she needs to move on, and returns to Walford with Shirley, Mick and Tina. Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), and her toyboy fiancé, Jason Adams (Scott Neal), temporarily move into the Vic. Babe does not trust Jason, although they have a passionate encounter, which is caught by Mick and Linda. Linda asks Babe to ensure Jason leaves Walford without informing Elaine of the reason, but when Elaine teases Babe, she reveals that she had sex with Jason. Elaine refuses to believe this, while Jason suggests that he and Babe steal from the pub and leave together. Babe secretly records the conversation and plays it to the Carters, who force Jason to leave. Babe admits to Elaine and Linda that she and Jason did not have sex and that she feels lonely. Babe continues to clash with Cora and is humiliated when Cora exposes her baby farming past to the Carter family and the pub's customers. Linda contemplates evicting Babe, but after Babe successfully leads a protest to house Cora, Linda allows Babe to stay.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} sexual abuses {{committed}} by various armed {{groups in the}} east were limited in time or perpetrated sporadically, by multiple individuals.

Because the ovaries are relatively inactive in fetal life and childhood, they sustain little damage from lipid accumulation during childhood. In the case of lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency, when rising gonadotropin levels initiate puberty, despite the inefficiency of sex steroid synthesis, the ovaries will usually make enough estradiol to produce breast development, {{and in some cases}} even menarche, with menses continuing for some years. Ovarian and adrenal androgen production is minimal and produces little pubic or other body hair.|$|E

25|$|In European {{history when}} child labour was common, {{as well as}} in {{contemporary}} child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} causes of this {{transition}} to foreign labor and {{the demise of the}} system was the coming of the Civil War. Girls went to be nurses, back to their farms, or into positions that men had left when they went to the army. <b>These</b> <b>girls</b> were out of the mills {{for the duration of the}} war and when the mills reopened after the war, the girls were gone because they no longer needed the mills. They had rooted into their new occupations or moved on in life to the point where the mill was no longer suitable for them. The lack of mill girls created a movement towards Irish immigrants.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on a study}} {{released}} by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls {{is not an isolated}} phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas.

More information concluded from the research is that there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are women killed in domestic violence with former or current husbands, intimate partners or boyfriends in Texas over an entire year. There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas. And finally, there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are teen girls who died by suicide, homicide, and accidents in the state in one year.|$|E
25|$|Thinking of virginity as {{a stigma}} disempowered many boys {{because they felt}} deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E
