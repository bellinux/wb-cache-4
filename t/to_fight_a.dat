5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for the {{garrison}} of the fort and the attached defending forces <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and the garrison ready <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Morton {{attended}} the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation.

5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} the Muslim armies would indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In a council of war he suggested that Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim armies to one place so as <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|The new Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, {{was also}} {{hesitant}} <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> major battle. Instead, he ordered Warsaw to be fortified {{and allowed the}} Russians to cross the Vistula unopposed. In his opinion, the war could only be won diplomatically, by interventions of the United Kingdom, Austria and France. Should those fail, Skrzynecki believed Warsaw would hold out at least several weeks under a siege, after which the main bulk of the Polish Army would still be intact <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> decisive battle against the Russians, who by then would be cut off from their rear by the Vistula. On 10 August 1831 Skrzynecki {{was forced to resign}} and was replaced by Henryk Dembiński, the military governor of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} American men with {{political}} ambitions {{fought in the}} Black Hawk War. At least seven future U.S. Senators took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the Wisconsin Territory; and one future U.S. president. The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the Mounted Ranger Battalion {{under the command of}} Henry Dodge, which was expanded to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1833.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was unprepared <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> major maritime war before 1897.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> two-front war.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{celebrated the}} Secular games—a {{religious}} festival {{that had been}} revived by Augustus—to mark the 800th anniversary {{of the founding of}} Rome.

5|$|From November 1943, {{during the}} seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> costly war of attrition, while {{awaiting}} Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched {{a series of}} attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined. Some historians have called these stories improbable.|$|E
