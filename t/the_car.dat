5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save <b>The</b> <b>Car</b> Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park open. The group said that the closure of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an {{experiment}} that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E

50|$|The {{friction}} between the upper driving pulley and the cable was insufficient to move <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> were unbalanced, i.e. <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> was empty and <b>the</b> lower <b>car</b> was fully loaded. If the situation was reversed and <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> was fully loaded, the cable slipped round the wheel so that the speed of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> could not be controlled by braking the pulley.|$|R
5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. The attackers, around thirty men, {{established}} a fire base in a house overlooking <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of the attackers stormed <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E

Webber received only minor injuries, but retired from the race.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required to sit in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{in front of a}} blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped <b>the</b> <b>car</b> onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E

5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> featured heavy revisions to the team's previous cars and looked very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or {{come close to the}} World Title. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> was fitted with a Renault RS27 engine.|$|E

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E

Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting <b>the</b> <b>car</b> but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E

Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if <b>the</b> <b>car</b> explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that <b>the</b> <b>car</b> might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer.
