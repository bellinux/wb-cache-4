40|$|Constructivists {{hold that}} truths about {{practical}} reasons {{are to be}} {{explained in terms of}} truths about the correct exercise of practical reason (rather than vice versa). But what is the normative status of the correctness-defining standards of practical reason? The problem is that constructivism appears to presuppose the truth of two theses that seem hard to reconcile. First, for constructivism to be remotely plausible, <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standards</b> must be genuinely (and not merely formally or minimally) normative. Second, to avoid circularity, <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standards</b> must be non-reason-involving, i. e. prior to and independent of practical reasons. From the standpoint of the contemporary philosophy of normatively, this is a surprising combination to say the least. What could these genuinely normative but non-reason-involving standards possibly be? The standard constructivist response is to insist that <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standards</b> possess a special kind of necessity inasmuch as we only count as occupying the “deliberative standpoint” or as a “deliberative agent” insofar as we comply with or accept <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standards.</b> I offer a different response. My response holds that the special normative status of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standards</b> consists in their exhibiting a distinctive kind of practical necessity that derives from the fact that they determine what I have called elsewhere truths about “the thing to do” – namely, truths about correct answers {{to the question of what}} to do. Understanding the norms of practical reason in these terms vindicates the idea that standards of practical reason are genuinely normative since truths about the thing to do plausibly possess the hallmarks of genuine normativity. And it vindicates the idea that the standards are not reason-involving since truths about the thing to do are plausibly prior to and independent of truths about practical reasons...|$|R

50|$|Flow rates {{through an}} orifice plate can be {{calculated}} without specifically calibrating the individual flowmeter {{so long as the}} construction and installation of the device complies with the stipulations of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standard</b> or handbook. The calculation takes account of the fluid and fluid conditions, the pipe size, the orifice size and the measured differential pressure; it also takes account of the coefficient of discharge of the orifice plate, which depends upon the orifice type and the positions of the pressure tappings. With local pressure tappings (corner, flange and D+D/2), sharp-edged orifices have coefficients around 0.6 to 0.63, while the coefficients for conical entrance plates are in the range 0.73 to 0.734 and for quarter-circle plates 0.77 to 0.85. The coefficients of sharp-edged orifices vary more with fluids and flow rates than the coefficients of conical-entrance and quarter-circle plates, especially at low flows and high viscosities.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} with negligence {{is that it}} still requires the plaintiff {{to prove that the}} defendant's conduct fell below <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standard</b> of care. However, if an entire industry tacitly settles on a somewhat careless standard of conduct (that is, as analyzed {{from the perspective of a}} layperson), then the plaintiff may not be able to recover even though he or she is severely injured, because although the defendant's conduct caused his or her injuries, such conduct was not negligent in the legal sense (if everyone within the trade would inevitably testify that the defendant's conduct conformed to that of a reasonable tradeperson in such circumstances). As a practical matter, with the increasing complexity of products, injuries, and medical care (which made many formerly fatal injuries survivable), it is quite a difficult and expensive task to find and retain good expert witnesses who can establish the standard of care, breach, and causation.|$|E
50|$|Plugs {{and power}} cords have a rated voltage (V) and rated current (A) {{assigned}} {{to them by}} the manufacturer, and these values are required to be marked on the plug.

The international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 V or 250 V; these are the values for normal use, and at which they are tested. (Plugs and power cords are also required to be tested at higher voltage for a brief period of 1 minute to test their electrical strength in case of fault conditions.) The NEMA 1-15 U.S. 2 pin (Type A) and NEMA 5-15 U.S. 3 pin (Type B) plugs are rated at 125 V. Similar plugs used in countries with higher mains voltages in the range 220-250 V are rated at 250 V. Using an appliance, plug or power cord which is not appropriate for the territory (e.g. one rated for 125 V with a 230 V supply) may constitute a safety hazard.|$|E

As for the ULS, here also the SLS is not a physical situation but rather a computational check. The aim is to prove that under the action of Characteristic design loads (un-factored), and/or whilst applying certain (un-factored) magnitudes of imposed deformations, settlements, or vibrations, or temperature gradients etc. the structural behavior complies with, and does not exceed, the SLS design criteria values, specified in <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standard</b> in force. These criteria involve various stress limits, deformation limits (deflections, rotations and curvature), flexibility (or rigidity) limits, dynamic behavior limits, as well as crack control requirements (crack width) and other arrangements concerned with the durability of the structure and its level of everyday service level and human comfort achieved, and its abilities to fulfill its everyday functions. In view of non-structural issues it might also involve limits applied to acoustics and heat transmission that might also affect the structural design. To satisfy the serviceability limit state criterion, a structure must remain functional for its intended use subject to routine (read: everyday) loading, and as such the structure must not cause occupant discomfort under routine conditions. This calculation check is performed at a point located at {{the lower half of}} the elastic zone, where characteristic (un-factored) actions are applied and the structural behavior is purely elastic.|$|E

Some commentators consider <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>standard</b> to have instead been that of a diligentissimus paterfamilias ("most careful head-of-family"), a higher standard. This may have developed from an earlier standard of custodia. Custodia {{was a form of}} strict liability, where the only situation when the borrower would not be liable would be actions of a [...] "greater force" [...] (vis maior) such a theft with force, or what is called in the modern English law and act of God. If the borrower was liable, then he had an action available against the thief (the actio furti) or damager under the Lex Aquilia. Where the borrower was liable, Justinian at least gave the lender the choice of whether to sue the borrower in personam in breach of contract, or the thief or damager. The borrower was also liable for furtum if he misused the thing he had borrowed. If the borrowed thing had undisclosed defects which caused damage of which the lender was aware, then the lender would be liable under delict. The appropriate action for breach of contract was the actio commodati. If the lender owed the borrower money relating to another contract or sale, then he could keep the borrowed thing and offset the cost against the debt He could also bring the actio commodati contraria if his expenses exceeded the value of the property borrowed.|$|E
