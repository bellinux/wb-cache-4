5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> for filming is the {{environmental}} impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of}} the first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems,</b> however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{facing the}} early power {{companies}} was the hourly variable demand. When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high {{during the first}} hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked. As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide daytime service, with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897.|$|E
25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{was that}} the three button Xerox mouse cost over US$400 to build, which was not {{practical}} for a consumer-based personal computer. Apple commissioned Hovey-Kelley Design (which later became IDEO) to assist them with the mouse design, which not only had to be redesigned to cost US$25 instead of US$400, but also needed to be tested with real consumers outside a laboratory setting to learn how people were willing to use it. Hundreds of prototypes later, Apple settled on a single button mouse, {{roughly the size of}} a deck of cards. With the design complete, the operating system was adapted to interface with the single button design using keystrokes in combination with button clicks to recreate some of the features desired from the original Xerox three-button design.|$|E

25|$|William A. Prestre, a Swiss citizen {{living in}} Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{proposed}} using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced {{the military to}} lease an entire island in the Mississippi River to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train {{as many as two}} million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> {{is the nature}} of the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War in 1899 took Hedley to South Africa with 17 Field Company. One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> facing the British {{was the lack of}} suitable maps, so his surveying experience was in demand. He arrived in South Africa in November 1899, he was present at the Relief of Ladysmith, and was Mentioned in Despatches in a despatch dated 30 March 1900, though this was not gazetted until February 1901. The same Gazette carried a further Mention in a despatch dated 9 November 1900. He had been hospitalised earlier in 1900, and was discharged to return to duty in the week ending 18 May 1900. He received a third Mention in September 1901 for service up to April 1901. On 9 July 1901 he left Port Natal on the transport City of Cambridge which was due to arrive at Southampton on 3 August. His obituary in The Times records that he served in the Boer War until 1902, so he may have returned at a later date. In September 1901 it was gazetted that he had received brevet promotion to major for his South African service on 29 November 1900; substantive promotion to that rank came on 18 January 1902. He also received the Queen's South Africa Medal, with six clasps, for his service during the Boer War.|$|E

Patrick Ferrucci of the New Haven Register commented in the album review that [...] "She does get a little wishy-washy though, going from tunes like 'Mean' and 'It's All Your Fault' to 'Please Don't Leave Me' and 'Glitter in the Air'". He also added that the high points of Funhouse were the four tracks produced by Max Martin. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine stated that one of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> in Funhouse was its songwriting, saying, [...] "'Glitter in the Air,' with its emo-esque [...] "You called me sugar" [...] bridge, is overwrought with its clichéd imagery".|$|E
500|$|To {{move all}} the stones, Byne and Steilberg had a road built to the Tagus, and a barge {{attached}} to a fixed cable was assigned to ferry stones across. An old World War I trench railway {{was brought in to}} transport stones from the monastery to the ferry; its rails could be laid into any of the buildings. Men pushed the small rail cars along the narrow gauge tracks; the stones were then lifted into the ferry by crane, and another crane lifted them out of the ferry into trucks. One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> that Byne encountered was that Spain's three excelsior factories could not make enough packing material to keep the crate-packing crew supplied. At one point, realizing that the stones were likely to be used in California as external cladding for structural steel walls, Steilberg suggested the facing surface of each stone be sliced to a [...] "veneer" [...] of the thickness of [...] for easier packing and shipping, but Hearst wanted to retain the authenticity of the full-sized stones.

500|$|When {{adapting}} the characters for film, Thompson {{found that in}} the novel, [...] "Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods," [...] and that [...] "making the male characters effective was one of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems.</b> Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions." [...] Several major male characters in Sense and Sensibility were consequently altered significantly from the novel {{in an effort to}} appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are [...] "ideal" [...] modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as [...] "pleasing manners", especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.|$|E

What's the point of having henchmen if they're not there to protect you?". [...] Some reviews compared Neverwinter Nights 2 to , a previous Obsidian game that had received similar complaints.

One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if the game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> remain." ...|$|E
