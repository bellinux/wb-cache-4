25|$|Between 2:15 am and 2:31 am I-21 fired 34 shells at Newcastle. These rounds landed {{over a wide}} area, however, {{and caused}} little damage. Only one of the 20 {{conventional}} shells exploded, causing damage to a house on Parnell Place and wounding Bombardier Stanley Newton. Another shell damaged a nearby tram terminus but did not explode. At 2:28 am the guns at Fort Scratchley {{near the entrance to}} Newcastle's harbour opened fire on I-21. The submarine's commanding officer, Commander Matsumura Kanji, continued the bombardment for another three minutes as he believed that it would <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the Australian gunners to locate the submarine. By the time the attack concluded the fort's two guns had fired two salvos, but none of the four shells struck I-21.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1916, German interrogators were {{recording}} {{comments by}} British prisoners, that tanks were only useful in certain circumstances, that it would <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the new weapon to mature and that the Germans were equally expected to need more time to counter the tank or build their own. On 5 October, the 6th Army sent a report that the British tactic {{was thought to be}} to conceal numbers of tanks close to the front line and use them for infantry support. The British had been able to use them only in small numbers and the tanks had advanced with the infantry, halted at the German front line and fired machine-guns into it. Where gaps appeared in the German defence, the tanks had skilfully driven through and attacked the Germans on the flanks from behind, while others had driven deeper into the position to attack command posts and artillery batteries. The British were also reported to have brought up cavalry to exploit larger breaches and that when tanks had been encountered at close range, German infantry had panicked.|$|E

Much of Principal Skinner's behavior in the episode is based on teachers Oakley and Weinstein had in high school who, according to Oakley, were [...] "sad, lonely guys who lived with their mothers".

2500|$|In 189, {{after the}} warlord Dong Zhuo {{seized control of}} the Han central {{government}} and held the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage, Zhang Cheng wanted to gather like-minded people to rise up against Dong Zhuo's tyranny and overthrow him. At the time, Zhang Zhao (張昭), another younger brother of Zhang Fan and Zhang Cheng, was also serving as a Consultant (議郎) under the Han government. Zhang Zhao came from Chang'an to meet Zhang Cheng and tell him, [...] "We can't defeat Dong Zhuo now because we aren't as powerful as him. Besides, it'll <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> us to set your plan into motion. We'll need to draft civilians into military service, train them to be soldiers, gain support from the political elites, and so on. It's impossible to achieve all these at the moment. Dong Zhuo won't last long because he lacks legitimacy and relies solely on military power. Why don't we find someone to take shelter under, pledge allegiance to him, and wait {{for an opportunity to}} take action, and fulfil our ambitions." [...] Zhang Cheng agreed with his brother. He then resigned from government service, returned home, gathered his family members and moved to Yang Province.|$|E
2500|$|Petar Mitev {{notes that}} {{despite the fact that}} there is a {{significant}} discrepancy of viewpoints between the government and the presidency, the former would not benefit from a strategy premised on seriously discrediting the latter, as this could lead to general political chaos and embolden the protesters. In November 2013, culturologist Ivaylo Ditchev, in a contribution for Deutsche Welle, analyzed some possible scenarios that could bring about a resignation of the government – his preferred one is a [...] "moral catharsis of Bulgarian society", with students inspiring the support of wide segments of the intelligentsia, who in turn convince a majority of ordinary citizens to join the anti-government wave. A Citizen Forum (reminiscent of the one established in 1989 Czechoslovakia) is to be created and serve as a guarantor for the cleansing of Bulgarian politics – the participants in it will set the tone for political discussions, but refrain from taking part in politics. However, he regards this scenario as rather utopian and draws attention to the more realistic (if increasingly less appealing – from his standpoint – possibilities) – corporate and social issues like those related to health care causing a mass discontent and unions going on strike, triggering a paralysis of the country; [...] "behind the curtain events" [...] within the political echelons themselves, with GERB succeeding in using procedural tools (also with the tacit support of Western allies) to alter the balance of power in the National Assembly; the Attack party withdrawing its support for the government and emerging as the political face of popular protests inspired by nationalist causes (possibly attributable issues like the Syrian refugee crisis and illegal African migrants or concerns pertaining to the selling of Bulgarian land to foreigners). The latter scenario is regarded as especially problematic and as being incompatible with the underlying goals of the protest movement, because the new Parliament formed after such events would almost inevitably include fascist-leaning parties and would need to contend with significant polarization due to the presence of pro- and anti-European voices. In April 2014, sociologist Mikhail Mirchev rated the cabinet's chances to fend off future storms as good, but cautioned that the MRF was not necessarily a reliable coalition partner (judging by the past history of the MRF-BSP coalition dynamics) and any erratic behaviour on their part could be a major factor in bringing down the government. German political researcher Daniel Kadick notes that it may be advisable for a protest party to be formed, so that the current status quo in Bulgaria is not recreated after the next elections and in order for the electoral prospects of populist movements like [...] "Bulgaria without censorship" [...] to be reduced. Philologist and popular talk show host Iulian Vuchkov has declared his support for the protests, considering them long overdue because of the political passivity of Bulgarians, but has opposed early elections due to his belief that it will <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a successful [...] "professor party" [...] to be formed, so that it could become a viable election challenger. Political analysts Tihomir Bezlov and Ruslan Stefanov have suggested that tensions along political lines may manifest themselves in the aftermath of the next Parliamentary elections (while holding the view that the caretaker government will not have to deal with popular discontent) and do not believe that the protest potential has been exhausted.|$|E
