40|$|Auditory verbal {{hallucinations}} (AVH) are {{a hallmark}} of psychotic experience. Various mechanisms including misattribution of inner speech and imbalance between bottom-up and top-down factors in auditory perception potentially due to aberrant connectivity between frontal and temporo-parietal areas have been suggested to underlie AVH. Experimental evidence for disturbed connectivity of networks sustaining auditory-verbal processing is, however, sparse. We compared functional resting-state connectivity in 49 psychotic patients with frequent AVH and 49 matched controls. The analysis was seeded from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> middle temporal gyrus (MTG), thalamus, angular gyrus (AG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as these regions are implicated in extracting meaning from impoverished speech-like sounds. Aberrant connectivity was found for all seeds. Decreased connectivity was observed between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> MTG <b>and</b> its right homotope, between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> AG <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding inferior parietal cortex (IPC) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> inferior temporal gyrus, between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> thalamus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right cerebellum, {{as well as between}} <b>the</b> <b>left</b> IFG <b>and</b> <b>left</b> IPC, <b>and</b> dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC/VLPFC). Increased connectivity was observed between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> IFG <b>and</b> <b>the</b> supplementary motor area (SMA) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> insula <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> thalamus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> fusiform gyrus/hippocampus. <b>The</b> predisposition to experience AVH might result from decoupling between the speech production system (IFG, insula and SMA) and the self-monitoring system (DLPFC, VLPFC, IPC) leading to misattribution of inner speech. Furthermore, decreased connectivity between nodes involved in speech processing (AG, MTG) and other regions implicated in auditory processing might reflect aberrant top-down influences in AVH...|$|R

In the transverse plane, the renal height was 2. 42 ± 0. 28 cm in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> kidney <b>and</b> 2. 38 ± 0. 27 cm in the right kidney, whereas the renal width was: 2. 65 ± 0. 35 cm in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> kidney <b>and</b> 2. 63 ± 0. 31 cm in the right kidney. In the dorsal plane, the renal length was 3. 84 ± 0. 53 cm in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> kidney <b>and</b> 3. 97 ± 0. 54 cm in the right kidney, whereas the renal width was 2. 65 ± 0. 34 cm in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> kidney <b>and</b> 2. 66 ± 0. 33 cm in the right kidney.

40|$|Objective. To {{explore the}} {{underlying}} mechanism {{of depression in}} asthmatic patients, the ReHo in the insula and its FC was used to probe the differences between depressed asthmatic (DA) and nondepressed asthmatic (NDA) patients. Methods. 18 DA patients, 24 NDA patients, and 60 healthy controls (HCs) received resting-state fMRI scan, severity of depression, and asthma control assessment. Results. DA patients showed increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventral anterior insula (vAI) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> middle temporal gyrus compared with both NDA and HC groups. In addition, compared with HCs, the DA and NDA patients both exhibited increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), decreased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bilateral parietal lobe, and increased FC between the right vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> putamen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right caudate, respectively. Furthermore, the increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right ACC could differentiate HCs from both DA and NDA patients, and the increased FC between the right vAI <b>and</b> both <b>the</b> <b>left</b> putamen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right caudate could separate NDA patients from HCs. Conclusions. This study confirmed that abnormal vAI FC {{may be involved in}} the neuropathology of depression in asthma. The increased FC between <b>the</b> <b>left</b> vAI <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> MTG could distinguish DA from the NDA and HC groups...|$|R

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.|$|E

They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E
