40|$|An {{open-ended}} {{cylindrical cell}} {{with a single}} annular <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> located {{at the center of}} the excitation and detection region is demonstrated for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A trapping well is created by applying a static potential to the <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> of polarity opposite the charge of the ion to be trapped, after which conventional dipolar excitation and detection are performed. The annular <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> is axially narrow to allow the creation of a potential well without excessively shielding excitation and detection. Trapping is limited to the region of homogeneous excitation at the cell centerline without the use of capacitive coupling. Perfluorotributylamine excitation profiles demonstrate negligible axial ejection throughout the entire excitation voltage range even at an effective centerline potential of only − 0. 009 V. High mass resolving power in the single-trap electrode cell is demonstrated by achievement of mass resolving power of 1. 45 × 106 for benzene during an experiment in which ions created in a high pressure source cubic cell are transferred to the low pressure analyzer single-trap electrode cell for detection. Such high performance is attributed to the negligible radius dependent radial electric field for ions cooled to the center of the potential well and accelerated to less than 60 % of the cell radius. An important distinction of the single-trap electrode geometry from all previous open and closed cell arrangements is exhibition of combined gated and accumulated trapping. Because there is no potential barrier, all ions penetrate into the trapping region regardless of their translational energy as in gated trapping, but additional ions may accumulate over time, as in accumulated trapping. Ions of low translational kinetic energy are demonstrated to be preferentially trapped in the single-trap electrode cell. In a further demonstration of the minimal radial electric field of the single-trap electrode cell, positive voltages can be applied to the annular <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> as well as the source cell <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> to achieve highly efficient transfer of ions between cells...|$|E

The {{use of a}} central <b>trapping</b> <b>electrode</b> for FTICR coupled with an open cell design retains the advantages of high ion throughput and gas conductance, while simplifying the electrode geometry and reducing the overall dimensions of the cell.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{thorough}} {{analysis of the}} electronic detection of charged particles, confined in a Penning trap, via image charges induced in the <b>trap</b> <b>electrodes.</b> <b>Trapping</b> of charged particles in an electrode structure leads to frequency shifts, which are due to image charge and space charge effects. These effects are of importance for Penning trap experiments which involve high charge densities or require high precision in the motional frequencies. Our analysis of image charges shows that only (higher order) odd powers of the particle displacement lead to induced charge differences, giving rise to a signal. This implies that, besides the centre-of-mass frequency of a trapped particle cloud, also higher order individual particle frequencies induce a signal, which can {{be picked up by}} an electronic detection circuit attached to the <b>trap</b> <b>electrodes.</b> We also derive analytic expressions for the image charge and space charge induced frequency shifts and perform simulations of space charge effects.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{construction}} and implementation of an in situ plasma discharge designed to remove surface contaminants from electrodes in an ion trapping experimental system is presented with results. In recent years, many advances {{have been made in}} using ion traps for quantum information processing. All of the criteria defined by DiVincenzo for using ion traps for implementing a quantum computer have been individually demonstrated, and in particular surface traps provide a scalable platform for ions. In order to be used for quantum algorithms, trapped ions need to be cooled to their motional (quantum mechanical) ground state. One of the hurdles in integrating surface ion traps for a quantum computer is minimizing electric field noise, which causes the ion to heat out of its motional ground state and which increases with smaller ion-to-electrode distances realized with surface traps. Surface contamination of trap electrodes is speculated to be the primary source of electric field noise. The main goal achieved by this work was to implement an in situ surface cleaning solution for surface electrode ion traps, which would not modify the ion <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> surface metal. Care was taken in applying the RF power in order to localize a plasma near the trap electrodes. A method for characterizing the energy of the plasma ions arriving at the ion trap surface is presented and results for plasma ion energies are shown. Finally, a method for quantifying the effectiveness of plasma cleaning of trap electrodes, using the surface analysis technique of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for measuring the amount and kind of surface contaminants, is described.

40|$|AbstractIon motion during {{frequency}} sweep excitation was computer simulated {{to study the}} effect of the direction of {{frequency sweep}} on the z motion of ions in a cylindrical Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) cell.

Recently a series of measurements of the heating rates in surface-electrode ion traps characterized their frequency, distance, and temperature dependencies, but {{our understanding of the}} microscopic origin of this noise is still vague. In this work we develop a theoretical model for the electric field noise which is associated with a random distribution of adsorbed atoms on the <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> surface.

40|$|Electric field {{noise is}} {{a major source of}} {{motional}} heating in trapped ion quantum computation. While the influence of <b>trap</b> <b>electrode</b> geometries on electric field noise has been studied in patch potential and surface adsorbate models, only smooth surfaces are accounted for by current theory. The effects of roughness, a ubiquitous feature of surface electrodes, are poorly understood. We investigate its impact on electric field noise by deriving a rough-surface Green's function and evaluating its effects on adsorbate-surface binding energies. At cryogenic temperatures, heating rate contributions from adsorbates are predicted to exhibit an exponential sensitivity to local surface curvature, leading to either a large net enhancement or suppression over smooth surfaces. For typical experimental parameters, orders-of-magnitude variations in total heating rates can occur depending on the spatial distribution of absorbates. Through careful engineering of electrode surface profiles, our results suggests that heating rates can be tuned over orders of magnitudes. by Kuan-Yu Lin. Thesis: S.

The effects of buffer gas collisions on ion motion during both mass-selective instability and resonance ejection scans are found to include the expected dampening of spatial excursions as well as limitation of the kinetic energy of trapped ions. In both experiments, ion ejection occurs over a number of secular cycles in the vicinity of the theoretical instability point. Activation via a resonant ac signal or a short dc pulse is shown to result in phase-locking of the ions as well as the expected increase in the size of the excursions in the z direction and in ion kinetic energy.

Demonstration of a single trapped Yb+ ion within a two-layer macroscopic ion trap is presented. with an ion-electrode distance of 310 (10) μm. The anomalous heating rate and spectral noise density of the trap was measured, a main form of decoherence within ion traps. The second half of this thesis presents the design and fabrication of multi-layer asymmetric ion traps. This allows for isolated electrodes that cannot be accessed via surface pathways, allowing for higher density of electrodes as well as creating novel trap designs that allow for the potential of quantum simulations to be demonstrated. These include two-dimensional lattices and ring trap designs in which the isolated electrodes provide more control in the ion position.

One {{of the most promising}} physical systems in which implementing such a device seems viable are trapped atomic ions. All of the fundamental operations needed for quantum information processing have already been experimentally demonstrated in trapped ion systems. Today, the remaining two obstacles are to improve the fidelities of these operations up to the point where quantum error correction techniques can be successfully applied, as well as to scale up the present systems to a higher number of quantum bits (qubits). This thesis addresses both issues. On the one hand, it decribes the experimental implementation of a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gate, which is the most technically demanding fundamental operation to realise in practice. On the other hand, the presented work is carried out in a microfabricated surface ion trap â an architecture that holds the promise of scalability. The gate is applied directly to hyperfine "atomic clock" qubits in 43 Ca + ions using the near-field microwave magnetic field gradient produced by an integrated <b>trap</b> <b>electrode.</b> To protect the gate against fluctuating energy shifts of the qubit states, as well as to avoid the need to null the microwave field at the position of the ions, a dynamically decoupled MÃ¸lmer-SÃ¸rensen scheme is employed.

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{interest}} in developing methods for transferring quantum information. We discuss a way to transfer quantum information between two trapped ions through a wire. The motion of a trapped ion induces oscillating charges in the <b>trap</b> <b>electrodes.</b> By sending this current to the electrodes of a nearby second trap, the motions of ions in the two traps are coupled. We investigate the electrostatics of a set-up where two separately trapped ions are coupled through an electrically floating wire. We also discuss experimental issues, including possible sources of decoherence. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
