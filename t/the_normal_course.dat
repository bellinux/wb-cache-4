5|$|The final British {{withdrawal}} from Aden {{took place in}} November 1967. Colonel Mitchell and the Argylls arrived back at their Plymouth garrison on 27 November. Unlike all the other battalion commanders from Aden, Mitchell was not decorated, receiving only the Mention in Despatches.

5|$|The {{practice}} of decompression techniques {{is another matter}} altogether. Recreational divers are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers. Technical, commercial, military and scientific divers may all be expected to do decompression dives in <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> of their sport or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and theoretical training for these divers is on the {{practice of}} safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection {{and use of the}} appropriate equipment.|$|E
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject when compared to <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action {{was more or less}} preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} induce biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result {{from the use of}} antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.|$|E
25|$|Normal is a {{four-year}} course {{leading up to}} the Normal-level (N-level) exam, with the possibility of a fifth year {{leading up to the}} GCE O-level exam. Normal is split into Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical). Normal (Academic) course are geared towards preparing students for the O-level exam in the fifth year, subject to good performance in the N-level exam in the fourth year, and students take academic subjects such as Principles of Accounting. In Normal (Technical), students take subjects of a more technical nature, such as Design and Technology, and they generally proceed to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) after the N-level exam in the fourth year. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in <b>the</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>course</b> would have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N-level exam.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing events further catalyzed the situation. Protests {{turned into}} riots on 2 June 1967, when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, visited West Berlin. There were protesters but also {{hundreds}} of {{supporters of the}} Shah, {{as well as a}} group of fake supporters armed with wooden staves, there to disturb <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> of the visit. These extremists beat the protesters. After a day of angry protests by exiled Iranian radical Marxists, a group widely supported by German students, the Shah visited the Berlin Opera, where a crowd of German student protesters gathered. During the opera house demonstrations, German student Benno Ohnesorg {{was shot in the head}} by a police officer while attending his first protest rally. The officer, Karl-Heinz Kurras, was acquitted in a subsequent trial. It was later discovered that Kurras had been a member of the West Berlin communist party SEW and had also worked for the Stasi, though there is no indication that Kurras' killing of Ohnesorg was under anyone's, including the Stasi's, orders.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Normal</b> Technical (NT) <b>Course</b> was {{introduced}} in Singapore in 1994 to provide secondary school students who are more technically inclined {{with an opportunity to}} complete 10 years of basic education that prepares them for post-secondary technical and vocational courses at the Institute of Technical Education in Singapore. Mathematics and Computer Applications (CPA) are compulsory core subjects for the students in <b>the</b> <b>Normal</b> Technical <b>Course.</b> Currently, these two subjects are taught separately either by the same teacher or different teachers. Over the years, feedback and observations have shown that students are more interested and have done better in the study of Computer Applications than Mathematics. Teachers face more difficulty keeping students engaged and on task in the learning of mathematics. An innovative way of redesigning pedagogy leverages on Normal Technical students’ strong interest in Computer Applications to teach them Mathematics. The study aims to find out the pedagogical approaches and types of scaffolding that would be best for teachers to implement the teaching of Mathematics with Computer Applications for students in <b>the</b> <b>Normal</b> Technical <b>Course.</b> This work is leading to a re-conceptualisation of the teaching and learning of mathematics with the learning of computer applications.
