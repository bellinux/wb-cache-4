5|$|Cöln was {{assigned}} to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Cöln was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. She was hit several times by the battlecruisers' large-caliber guns, but managed to escape in the haze. She inadvertently <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> them, however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned Cöln, but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.|$|E

Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. In their attempts to ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E

Payne's journey was uneventful until he approached Holderman's Grove. Payne approached the grove, about halfway between Plainfield and Ottawa, {{when he was}} ambushed by a waiting war party of Native Americans.

He turned his horse to flee {{but it was also}} wounded in the encounter and after a chase of 14 or 15 miles it fell dead beneath him. Unarmed, Payne was overtaken by the attackers and purportedly decapitated, one witness to the body's discovery indicated that he was only scalped and his head remained attached to his body. In the index to his 2006 book, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, Kerry A. Trask refers to the incident as the Holderman's Grove raid.|$|E
25|$|Several vessels {{encountered}} the storm, with one reporting 110nbsp&km/h (70nbsp&mph) winds early on Decembernbsp&22. That day winds {{along the coast}} of Ceylon increased; the storm accelerated during this time as well. Early on Decembernbsp&23, the cyclone struck the northern tip of Ceylon and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> the west-northwest. According to an officer on Pamban Island, located between Ceylon and Southern India, the storm's eye was no more than 16nbsp&km (10nbsp&mi) wide. Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240nbsp&km/h (150nbsp&mph), with gusts as high as 280nbsp&km/h (175nbsp&mph). This ranked the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Additionally, the IMD estimated its central pressure to have been, at most, 970nbsp&mbar (hPa; 28.64nbsp&inHg). The lowest observed pressure was 978nbsp&mb (hPa; 28.88nbsp&inHg) in Mannar on the west coast of Ceylon. Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu, south of Tondi. Once onshore, the cyclone rapidly weakened, becoming a depression before emerging over the Arabian Sea on Decembernbsp&24. The system degenerated into a remnant low later that day and dissipated over open waters on Decembernbsp&26.|$|E

The remaining men continued north, reaching Lake Champlain at a point between Fort Carillon and Fort St. Frédéric on January 21. They spotted a sled moving on the lake toward Fort St. Frédéric, so Rogers sent Lieutenant John Stark and some men to intercept it. [...] However, more sleds were spotted, and Stark's men were seen before they could retreat back into the woods. The sleds <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Carillon.

Tegetthoff immediately ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the men in the water, but with San Martino fast approaching, he could not leave his ship a stationary target.

500|$|At 06:45, the British cruisers [...] and [...] {{and five}} Italian destroyers sortied to {{intercept}} Novara, Helgoland, and Saida. By 09:00, the faster British cruisers had {{caught up to}} the Austro-Hungarian vessels, and both sides called for reinforcements; a flotilla centered on the armored cruiser [...] was sent to assist Horthy's cruisers. Dartmouth opened fire first and scored a hit on Novara, and the three Austro-Hungarian cruisers laid smoke screens and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> their pursuers, scoring several hits on Dartmouth in the process. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe were damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. Horthy was badly injured as well, though he remained in command. At 11:05, the Entente commander, Admiral Alfredo Acton, turned away {{in an attempt to}} separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the first}} two years of the war, the High Seas Fleet, {{including}} König Albert, conducted a number of sweeps and advances into the North Sea. The first occurred on 2–3 November 1914, though no British forces were encountered. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, adopted a strategy in which the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group raided British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. The raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15–16 December 1914 was the first such operation. On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts—including König Albert and her four sisters—and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within [...] of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire British Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>toward</b> Germany.|$|E
500|$|Persano {{immediately}} {{ordered his}} ships to form up with Vacca's, {{first in line}} abreast formation, and then in line ahead formation; Affondatore was initially located on the disengaged side of the Italian line. Shortly before the action began, Persano decided to leave his flagship, , and transfer to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. Persano used Affondatore to steam up and down the Italian line, issuing various orders to the individual ships, but as the ship captains were not aware that he was aboard Affondatore, they ignored his signals.
