40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some results}} concerning numerical and experimental research activities {{carried out to}} investigate aerodynamics of downwind sail plan configurations of IACC V 5 yacht. In particular, RANS computational analyses performed using the commercial code Flu-ent (Ansys, Inc.) are presented and compared with experimental measures available from wind tunnel tests carried out at the Politecnico di Milano Twisted Flow Wind Tunnel. Sails flying shapes related <b>to</b> actual <b>sails</b> <b>trimming</b> have been detected during the wind tunnel tests and used as numerical simulation input. ...|$|R
50|$|The rigging of the 303 {{differs from}} the 2.3 in {{that it has been}} raised and a jib has been added. Although the jib is self-tacking the {{addition}} of it to the rigging does mean that the crew have an extra <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> which adds some complexity in comparison to the 2.3. Another change from the 2.3 is the possibility <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> the 303 as a two-man boat, although it is still possible <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> it solo. This means that the boat is suitable for coaching, as the coach can sit in the boat with the crew and let them run over the various aspects of control in a whilst on the water, and can take complete control of the boat if necessary.|$|R

50|$|A {{wishbone}} ketch rigged vessel is {{a vessel}} that is rigged as a ketch where a permanent splitting gaff is mounted between two masts. Contrary to the gaff rig (where the gaff is hoisted {{together with the}} sail) the gaff stays in the mast. The gaff is typically fixed on the first mast (the one closer to the front) and fixed via a line to the aftmost mast. These lines allow the <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> be <b>trimmed</b> to suit the wind.|$|R
40|$|A novel method {{similar to}} marching {{technique}} {{was used to}} model wind tunnel tests. ► <b>Sail</b> <b>trim</b> criteria based on their interactive effect are identified. ► Areas of separated flow were characterised. ► Local flow field was correlated with sail surface pressures. ► An aerodynamic model based on potential flow with viscous correction is proposed. International audienceThe aerodynamics of a sailing yacht with different <b>sail</b> <b>trims</b> are presented, derived from simulations performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics. A Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes approach was used <b>to</b> model sixteen <b>sail</b> <b>trims</b> first tested in a wind tunnel, where thepressure distributions on the sails were measured. An original approach was employed byusing two successive simulations: the first one on a large domain to model the blockage due to the wind tunnel walls and the sails model, and a second one on a smaller domain to model the flow around the sails model. A verification and validation of the computed aerodynamic forces and pressure distributions was performed. The computed pressure distribution is shown to agree well with the measured pressures. The sail surface pressure was correlated {{with the increase of}} turbulent viscosity in the laminar separation bubble, the flow reattachment and the trailing edge separation. The drive force distribution on both sails showed that the fore part of the genoa (fore sail) provides the majority of the drive force and that the effect of the aft <b>sail</b> is mostly <b>to</b> produce an upwash effect on the genoa. An aerodynamic model based on potential flow theory and a viscous correction is proposed. This model, with one free parameter to be determined, is shown to fit the results better than the usual form drag and induced drag only, even if no friction drag is explicitly considered...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} use of Gaussian {{processes}} <b>to</b> solve <b>sail</b> <b>trimming</b> optimization problems. The Gaussian process, used to model the dependence of the performance with the trimming parameters, is constructed from {{a limited number of}} performance estimations at carefully selected trimming points, potentially enabling the optimization of complex sail systems with multiple trimming parameters. The proposed approach is tested on a two-parameter trimming for a scaled IMOCA mainsail in upwind sailing conditions. We focus on the robustness of the proposed approach and study especially the sensitivity of the results to noise and model error in the point estimations of the performance. In particular, we contrast the optimization performed on a real physical model set in a wind tunnel with a fully non-linear numerical fluid structure interaction model of the same experiments. For this problem with a limited number of trimming parameters, the numerical optimization was affordable and found to require a comparable amount of performance estimation as for the experimental case. The results reveal a satisfactory agreement for the numerical and experimental optimal trimming parameters, considering the inherent sources of errors and uncertainties in both numerical and experimental approaches. Sensitivity analyses have been eventually performed in the numerical optimization problem to determine the dominant source of uncertainties and characterize the robustness of the optima...|$|R
50|$|Sailboats use {{the power}} of the wind acting on <b>sails</b> <b>to</b> propel the boat. Model sailboats are {{typically}} controlled via a multi-channel radio transmitter {{in the hands of the}} operator with a corresponding receiver in the boat. By changing the position of the two joysticks on the transmitter signals are sent over two separate channels on a single radio frequency (assigned to the individual boat/operator). On the boat, the radio receiver is connected to two battery-powered electric motors or servos. Signals from the radio transmitter are interpreted by the radio receiver and translated into instructions to change the position of the servos. One servo controls the position of both main and jib sails together (allowing the <b>sails</b> <b>to</b> be <b>trimmed),</b> the other the position of the rudder (allowing the boat to be steered).|$|R

5000|$|In these {{diagrams}} {{the direction}} of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with point of sail. Constant VA in these examples means that either VT or VB varies with point of sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case Newtons). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the sail's angle of attack (α [...] ) is essentially constant, although the boom angle over the boat changes with point of <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> the <b>sail</b> close <b>to</b> the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force (FT) into forward driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT) vary with point of sail. Forward driving force (FR) increases, as {{the direction of}} travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force (FLAT) decreases.|$|R
5000|$|Yard - A {{horizontal}} spar on {{a square}} rigged ship fitted to the forward {{side of a}} mast, holding a square sail forward of the shrouds. Each square sail hangs from its own yard. Sails are furled by seamen who bend over the yard and use both hands to haul up the sail. The <b>sail</b> is <b>trimmed</b> <b>to</b> the wind by braces leading from the yard arms (ends of the yard) aft (or forward) to another mast, or down to the deck. Compare to [...] "gaff" [...] and [...] "boom", which attach to the aft side of the mast and hold a [...] "fore-and-aft" [...] sail aft of the shrouds. A square <b>sail</b> <b>trims</b> <b>to</b> either side of athwartships, and a fore-and-aft <b>sail</b> <b>trims</b> <b>to</b> either side of fore-and-aft.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} <b>sail</b> <b>trim</b> {{adjustments}} {{that can be}} built into the Impulse's rigging and hull giving an Impulse sailor more options <b>trim</b> the <b>sail</b> on the water than those available to Laser sailors.|$|R
50|$|Mainsail and jib are {{controlled}} by a single sheet. The rig was extensively used on model boats but has recently been used of full-sized vessels. On model boats, it dramatically reduces the energy consumption of <b>sail</b> <b>trimming.</b>|$|R
50|$|A sailing craft is said <b>to</b> be <b>sailing</b> {{close-hauled}} (also called beating {{or working}} to windward) when its <b>sails</b> are <b>trimmed</b> in tightly, are acting substantially like a wing, and the craft's course {{is as close}} to the wind as allows the <b>sail(s)</b> <b>to</b> generate maximum lift. This point of sail lets the sailing craft travel diagonally to the wind direction, or 'upwind'.|$|R
50|$|An upwind vessel {{is able to}} {{manoeuvre}} at will toward any downwind point, {{since in}} doing so the relative wind moves aft. A vessel downwind of another, however, in attempting to attack upwind, is constrained <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>sail</b> as the relative wind moves forward and cannot point too far into the wind {{for fear of being}} headed. In sailing warfare, when beating to windward, the vessel experiences heeling under the sideward pressure of the wind. This restricts gunnery, as cannon on the windward side are now elevated, while the leeward gun ports aim into the sea, or in heavy weather may be awash. A ship with the weather gage, turning downwind to attack, may alter course at will in order to bring starboard and port guns to appropriate elevations. Ships seeking to evade capture or attack, however, have the advantage being downwind if they are faster vessels or are close to friendly land.|$|R

60|$|I {{laughed at}} this conceit, telling Marble {{he would be}} wise to remain where he was. I would give the Speedy four hours to get herself in {{tolerable}} <b>sailing</b> <b>trim</b> again, supposing her bent on pursuit.

50|$|Sailing courses {{laid out}} for racing {{purposes}} always have one leg directly to windward. This is where the highest sailing skills often form {{the essence of the}} race. <b>Sail</b> <b>trim</b> and keeping the boat moving most efficiently are of the utmost importance.

50|$|The {{very large}} sail area demands {{constant}} {{control of the}} power generated by the sails. As soon as the breeze increases, wind must be spilled to maintain balance.

50|$|The single sail of the Optimist is sprit-rigged. Two battens stiffen the leech. It is secured {{evenly with}} ties along the luff to the mast {{and along the}} foot to the boom, pulled down tightly by a vang/kicker. The light, slim third spar, the sprit, extends through a loop {{at the peak of}} the sail; the bottom rests in the eye of a short cable or string which hangs along the front edge of the mast. Raising and {{lowering}} the sprit and adjusting the boom vang allow for adaptation of <b>sail</b> <b>trim</b> <b>to</b> a range of wind conditions. Similarly, the Optimist has a small string outhaul on the end of the boom. It is usually correct to tighten the boomvang, outhaul, and sprit in heavy winds and loosen them in light winds. As well as this, huge adjustments can be made <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> shape, due <b>to</b> all of the ties running along the mast and boom.|$|R
50|$|A {{backstay}} is a {{piece of}} standing rigging on a sailing vessel that runs from the mast to either its transom or rear quarter, counteracting the forestay and jib. It is an important <b>sail</b> <b>trim</b> control and has a direct effect on the shape of the mainsail and the headsail. Backstays are generally adjusted by block and tackle, hydraulic adjusters, or lines leading to winches.|$|R

60|$|He {{insisted that}} the yawl must be gotten into the water without delay, because his duties might necessitate his going ashore at a moment's notice; and it was nearly time for the sun to set before the little boat was in <b>sailing</b> <b>trim.</b> While the boys were engaged in this work Joe called upon Bob so often that the old sailor grew quite eager to see the job progress, and, like the others, almost ceased to dwell upon the bitter disappointment.|$|R
60|$|When we {{had finally}} come {{within sight of}} the lake, it was to find the {{foremost}} of our party drawn up in something approaching military order. Captain Jackman had succeeded in bringing them to a halt while yet half a mile from the shore, and this was done because the British and Tories had made a stand while their boats, which had been left at that point when they marched to the investment of Fort Schuyler, could be put in <b>sailing</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{control lines}} (ropes) on the boom act in {{conjunction}} with the halyard and leech line to ensure that the <b>sail</b> is <b>trimmed</b> most effectively.|$|R
5000|$|The {{approximate}} {{locus of}} net aerodynamic force on a craft {{with a single}} sail is the centre of effort (CE [...] ) at the geometric centre of the sail. Filled with wind, the sail has a roughly spherical polygon shape and if the shape is stable, then the location of centre of effort is stable. On sailing craft with multiple sails, the position of centre of effort varies with the <b>sail</b> plan. <b>Sail</b> <b>trim</b> or airfoil profile, boat trim and point of sail also affect CE.|$|R
50|$|As {{the lift}} {{generated}} by a sail increases, so does lift-induced drag, which together with parasitic drag constitute total drag, which acts in a direction parallel to the incident airstream. This occurs as the angle of attack increases with <b>sail</b> <b>trim</b> or change of course and causes the lift coefficient to increase {{up to the point}} of aerodynamic stall along with the lift-induced drag coefficient. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag. Sails with the apparent wind behind them (especially going downwind) operate in a stalled condition.|$|R
60|$|In summer, {{changes in}} the motions of the ice {{take place in the}} most {{unexpected}} manner. Currents in the ocean are, no doubt, the chief cause of these; the action of winds has also something to do with them. One of these changes was now taking place. Almost before the men got on board the ice had separated, and long canals of water were seen opening up here and there. Soon after that a light breeze sprang up, the ice-anchors were taken aboard, the <b>sails</b> <b>trimmed,</b> and soon the Hope was again making her way slowly but steadily to the north.|$|R
5000|$|In sailing, it is a {{mechanical}} device used {{to modify the}} location at which lines used <b>to</b> control <b>sails</b> (such as sheets) {{are attached to the}} vessel. The attachment is often by means of a block through which the line runs; the block can move along the traveller. This allows independent control of the direction and tension of the line running through the block, which allows the sailor to position the block in the optimal location for the wind conditions and desired <b>sail</b> <b>trim.</b> This kind of traveller is often a metal track, which is attached to the deck of the boat. The block is attached to a [...] "car", which much like a miniature railroad car, attaches to the track and slides along it in either direction. A traveller on a smaller craft (such as the popular single-handed [...] "Laser" [...] sailboat) might simply be a line attached to two points on the deck, along which another block runs. The term traveller can also be applied to the specialized lines used to control the location of the block.|$|R
60|$|One {{inconvenience}} I sometimes {{experienced in}} so small a house, {{the difficulty of}} getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the big thoughts in big words. You want room for your thoughts <b>to</b> get into <b>sailing</b> <b>trim</b> and run a course or two before they make their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plow out again through {{the side of his}} head. Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations, must have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that we could not begin to hear--we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other's undulations. If we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other's breath; but if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above, being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other's voice in any case. Referred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing; but there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout. As the conversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there was not room enough.|$|R
6000|$|The {{fight was}} not long. Many of the turbaned crew jumped overboard, {{and the others}} were quickly subdued. It would have been a grand thing if Decatur and his gallant sailors could have carried off the [...] "Philadelphia," [...] and have taken her out to the squadron. But this was {{absolutely}} impossible. Her foremast had been cut down in order to lighten her so that she could be floated off the reef, and many of her sails were wanting. Knowing that the vessel would not be found in <b>sailing</b> <b>trim,</b> Preble had issued positive orders that no attempt should be made to capture her, but that she should be burned.|$|R
