2500|$|From {{then on the}} writer's {{visits to}} the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an {{opportunity}} to [...] "speak the truth regardless," [...] as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who'd been banned from editing his Den (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the [...] "London propagandists", as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Ogarev were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned Chernyshevsky. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: [...] "The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done..." [...] - [...] "No, Tolstoy, I beg you never <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Chernyshevsky, please," [...] the monarch hastily retorted. This aborted conversation, as it happened, brought to an end a friendship that had lasted for forty years.|$|E
2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{alleging that the}} Buccaneers were a disorganized and confused organization, and returning veterans were promised that changes were forthcoming. It was pointed out {{that none of the}} team's administrative staff had any experience in their position, {{at the same time that}} a team of rookie players and coaches was being fielded. These problems were addressed with the firings and resignations of six coaches and administrators at the beginning of the year. Head coach John McKay used the opportunity to take control of more aspects of the organization, and selected replacements of his choosing. McKay was criticized over his handling of the players, and was accused of cutting veterans who could have helped the team, such as Ira Gordon, over ego conflicts. A perception arose that McKay was intolerant toward challenges to his authority, as he frequently cut players who argued with him, and surrounded himself with former USC players and staff. Concern that McKay preferred players who would keep their mouth shut, rather than players with talent, produced resentment among veterans who worried that their limited career spans would be spent with a losing team. Critics accused McKay of attempting a style of play that was more appropriate for the college game, and noted Don Shula's comment that preparing for the Buccaneers was like preparing to play USC. Reporters who covered the team indicated that McKay did not respond to the losing streak with the humor that it was hoped he would, but that he became an [...] "old grouch" [...] who complained about his coaching assistants, game-day officiating, and opposing coaches who he accused of running up the score. This was reflected in a bitter tone that had crept into McKay's trademark humor, with comments such as [...] "I keep a picture of O.J. Simpson by my side at all times <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the days when I knew how to coach".|$|E

60|$|The painted {{lighthouse}} on a {{small green}} island, the wharves and warehouses, with sloops and schooners moored alongside, or at anchor, or spreading their canvas to the wind, and boats rowing from point <b>to</b> point, <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> some fishing-town on the sea-coast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madonna Paola," [...] said he, in an icy voice, [...] "you have {{uttered a}} name that must not be heard within my walls of Pesaro, if you would prove {{yourself}} the friend of Boccadoro. <b>To</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> his true identity is <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> that which counts not in his favour." ...|$|E

She {{gave me this}} ring, <b>to</b> always <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my trust. I suppose," [...] he added ruefully, looking down upon it, [...] "it's no use now. I'd better take it off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it is from}} an old {{lawyer at}} Bath whom I used <b>to</b> know. He <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} I said to him {{four or five years}} ago--some little time before we were married--about Dorothy.' ...|$|R

50|$|The signs, whether {{free-standing}} or attached <b>to</b> walls, <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> inscriptions, {{and this}} {{led me to}} think about the inscriptional origins of Roman caps and the everlasting problem of reconciling capitals with lowercase. For me, the moment when the first true synthesis occurred was in the type of De Aetna. This led me in turn to the Beinecke Library to pore over their copy of the book and its typeâ€”the archetype of Roman type for me.|$|R

60|$|From {{the tree}} against which I was {{standing}} I {{was able to}} watch the subsequent proceedings unobserved. The lady looked at Mr. Parable and then turned away and smiled to herself. It was a peculiar smile, and, again in some way I am unable <b>to</b> explain, <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my first wife. It was not till the pelican put down his other leg and walked away that Mr. Parable, turning his gaze westward, {{became aware of the}} lady's presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the way {{she manages}} our dear youngsters," [...] {{continued}} the mate, reading on, without noticing Jerry's interruption, [...] "would do your heart good <b>to</b> see.

60|$|I {{remember}} going home from our talk. I went down Farringdon Street to the Embankment because I thought {{to go home}} by Holborn and Oxford Street would be too crowded for thinking....

6000|$|... "Nor do I now, Mr. Griffith; {{but you do}} well <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{my former}} weakness, for the {{recollection}} of its folly and imprudence only adds to my present strength." ...|$|E

5000|$|... â€˜It is {{a curious}} thing that Ikoli should have noticed that some boys {{run the risk of}} being spoiled. To this day Old Boys from Schools in which I taught in England before going <b>to</b> Lagos <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the lasting {{impression}} that was made on them when they showed any symptoms of such deterioration. The feasts so generously described in the December number were really only meeting s of the Matriculation class- Oluwole, Vaughan and Macaulay- who use to come up to my quarters {{once or twice a week}} to read Shakespeare.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Bill; [...] "and there'd allus be {{something}} left <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a very queer time, provided he lives {{to get out}} of it, which is doubtful. Cuttle-ink won't rub out, I'll warrant." ...|$|E
