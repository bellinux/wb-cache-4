5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E

5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, {{with the}} relatively new technique of meta-analysis, statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of}} the medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court because the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of {{mephedrone}} grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found {{it was the fourth}} most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1842, {{popular opinion}} had {{turned against the}} Mormons. After an unknown assailant shot and wounded Missouri {{governor}} Lilburn Boggs in May 1842, anti-Mormons circulated rumors that Smith's bodyguard, Porter Rockwell, was the shooter. Though <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> circumstantial, Boggs ordered Smith's extradition. Certain he would be killed if he ever returned to Missouri, Smith went into hiding twice during the next five months, before the U.S. district attorney for Illinois argued that Smith's extradition to Missouri would be unconstitutional. (Rockwell was later tried and acquitted.) In June 1843, enemies of Smith convinced a reluctant Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to extradite Smith to Missouri on an old charge of treason. Two law officers arrested Smith, but were intercepted by a party of Mormons before they could reach Missouri. Smith was then released on a writ of habeas corpus from the Nauvoo municipal court. While this ended the Missourians' attempts at extradition, it caused significant political fallout in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants.

Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E

5|$|He scored nine {{goals in}} 36 {{games in the}} 1904–05 season, as City came within two points and two places of champions Newcastle United. The season ended in {{controversial}} circumstances at Villa Park, and with a 3–2 defeat to Aston Villa ending any hopes of winning the league, Sandy Turnbull and Villa captain Alex Leake exchanged blows. The Football Association launched {{an investigation into the}} violence, and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the 1905–06 season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake. No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> not made public. The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign. He was transfer listed in May 1906 after he claimed that he had only attempted to bribe Leake on the orders of manager Tom Maley and that illegal payments were common practice at Hyde Road. The FA acted on his information, and fined Manchester City £900 for illegal payments and suspended numerous players, boardroom members and staff members.|$|E
5|$|In 1603 Dudley {{initiated}} {{moves to}} prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and Leicester. If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her jointure rights. Consequently, in February 1604, she filed a complaint against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles Leicester and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of Leicester testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. The other side was unable to cite clear evidence and the King's chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady Leicester. All <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> impounded to preclude a resumption of the case.|$|E
5|$|NC1 was {{the first}} to be sentenced, on 28 February 1990, after {{pleading}} guilty to having sex with someone under the age of consent. He was given six months' custody in a detention centre, the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence. Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge NC1 with rape, as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely {{due to a lack of}} evidence; Leigh's complaints about the incident as reported by witnesses were hearsay and therefore inadmissible in court. On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours' community service. In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual, and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody. A number of sources state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> presented to the court.|$|E
