5|$|The plan {{itself is}} not without controversy, as it has made the local club Kingstonian F.C.'s future very uncertain, with them unable {{to play in a}} ground that is now too big and {{expensive}} for a non-league side and one which <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any decision over.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes. Every class now {{possesses}} the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to rely on the Medic class.|$|E

5000|$|KWLE was {{formerly}} KLKI, playing standards similar to Seattle station KIXI. The format change in December 2007 angered many loyal listeners, {{who argued that}} <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> a local outlet to hear [...] "Standards".|$|R
50|$|Initially {{hourglass}} corsets {{were not}} laced {{as tightly as}} the straight-fronted corsets fashionable {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. Corsets were still the norm, but <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> the exaggerated wide-narrow-wide silhouette of the hourglass shape.|$|R
25|$|In modern {{time there}} has been huge {{reductions}} to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities.|$|E
25|$|Since the Middle Ages, the Galician Catholic Church {{has been}} {{organized}} into five ecclesiastical dioceses (Lugo, Ourense, Santiago de Compostela, Mondoñedo-Ferrol and Tui-Vigo). While these may have coincided with contemporary 15th-century civil provinces, <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the same boundaries as the modern civil provincial divisions. The church {{is led by}} one archbishop and four bishops. The five dioceses of Galicia are divided among 163 districts and 3,792 parishes. A few are governed by administrators, the remainder by parish priests.|$|E
25|$|Flashing green – {{flashing}} green aspects {{are employed}} on the East Coast Main Line north of Peterborough. They were installed for 140mph (225km/h) running {{in connection with}} the testing of the new InterCity 225 electric trains, with a steady green limiting test trains to the normal speed limit of 125mph (200km/h). <b>They</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> official meaning, but remain in place and {{there are a couple of}} locations where the presence or absence of flashing provides useful information to drivers.|$|E

25|$|A study {{investigating}} {{sensory integration}} {{within a single}} modality (vision) found that it cannot be established until age 12 and above. This particular study assessed the integration of disparity and texture cues to resolve surface slant. Though younger age groups showed a somewhat better performance when combining disparity and texture cues compared to using only disparity or texture cues, this difference was not statistically significant. In adults, the sensory integration can be mandatory, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> access to the individual sensory sources.|$|E
25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into a slave. To do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where they sense that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E

50|$|The era of President General Pervez Musharraf {{starting}} from 1999 saw {{a revolution in}} banking industry.

25|$|No one {{has been}} {{appointed}} Lord High Treasurer since 1714; it has remained in commission for three hundred years. The Treasury Commission ceased to meet late in the 18th century but has survived, albeit with very different functions: the First Lord of the Treasury is now the Prime Minister, the Second Lord is the Chancellor of the Exchequer (and actually {{in charge of the}} Treasury), and the Junior Lords are government Whips maintaining party discipline in the House of Commons; <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any duties related to the Treasury, though when subordinate legislation requires the consent of the Treasury it is still two of the Junior Lords who sign on its behalf.|$|E
25|$|After {{watching}} his embarrassing birthday party video and being mocked by his friends with gag gifts, Barney finally sees he is a hideous drunk, and he promises to get sober. At first, he finds sustaining sobriety tough, but he finds {{his way to}} an AA meeting with Homer's help. Meanwhile, to get their picture {{on the cover of}} the new phone book, Bart and Lisa decide to enter an amateur photo contest. In the closet, they find an old camera and start to take snapshots. Elsewhere, Barney makes plans to change his life now that he is clean and sober. The Springfield Flight School is his first stop, where he takes helicopter-flying lessons. At Moe's Tavern, Homer is treated as the new Barney and is forced by Moe, Lenny and Carl to perform drunken antics. Barney gives Homer a ride in the helicopter a few lessons later. While in the air, the two men fight about Barney's new sobriety and Homer's unhappiness that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> ridiculous adventures.|$|E

500|$|In a 2014 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone Magazine regarding the upcoming Queen + Adam Lambert North American tour with Adam Lambert, May and Taylor admitted that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> much contact with Deacon except regarding finances, with Taylor stating that [...] "'s completely retired from {{any kind of}} social contact", and describing him as [...] "a little fragile." [...] May added however, [...] "He still keeps {{an eye on the}} finances, though. John Deacon is still John Deacon. We don't undertake anything financial without talking to him." [...] Session bassist Neil Fairclough covered the tour.|$|E
500|$|Tickets {{are used}} both {{to enter and}} exit the paid area of the system. [...] A ticket {{inserted}} into a fare gate at the station of origin is processed and then ejected allowing a passenger through the turnstile. [...] The ejected ticket is then retrieved while passing through {{so that it can}} be used at the exit turnstile at the destination station to leave the premises. [...] Tickets are captured by the exit turnstiles to be reused by the system if <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any value. [...] If it is a stored value ticket with some value remaining, however, it is once again ejected by the fare gate to be taken by the passenger for future use.|$|E
500|$|British war {{correspondent}} Philip Gibbs noted Amiens' {{effect on}} the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, [...] "the enemy...is on the defensive" [...] and, [...] "the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands {{that we are able}} to strike him at many different places." [...] Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, [...] "the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. On our side the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly" [...] and that, [...] "there is a change also in the enemy's mind. <b>They</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation." ...|$|E

50|$|The bonded {{warehousing}} {{system was}} advocated by Adam Smith and permits merchants {{to increase their}} shipping capabilities as <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> to carry large sums of cash on hand to make the revenue payments. Prior to the system, merchants often had to sell their cargo on short notice and at reduced prices to obtain the necessary funds for assessed duties.|$|R
500|$|The first {{requirement}} of an express trust is capacity; the person creating the trust must be legally {{capable of doing}} so. Generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can form a trust, although there are exceptions. A minor cannot hold land, and therefore cannot create a trust of land; in addition, unless they are soldiers or [...] "mariners at sea", they cannot form a valid will. Where a minor tries to create a trust, it will be held voidable, and can be repudiated by him when he reaches majority, or soon after. Where the trust is clearly of detriment to the minor, the courts may decide to take it as void; the individual, when he reaches majority, could alternately plead non est factum {{if he had been}} too young to appreciate the nature of forming a trust. People who are considered mentally disordered (under the Mental Health Act 1983) and have a receiver appointed cannot have trusts directly enforced against them, as <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> control over their property. Where there is no receiver, the mentally disordered person's trust will be held void, unless it was made during a lucid period when the person was capable of understanding their actions. Corporations and statutory bodies only have the powers granted to them by their memorandum of association or authorising statute; if these do not authorise the creation of trusts, any such trust will be held to be ultra vires.|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (<b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> to pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart {{to the tune of}} [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E
2500|$|From {{that day}} on the person who played the drum was called [...] "tambourine player". That is how we got the drum. The {{chimpanzees}} of the bush were men who went astray.

25|$|Albert's {{difficulties}} with Riga's citizenry continued; with papal intervention, a settlement was reached in 1225 whereby <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> to pay tax to the Bishop of Riga, and Riga's citizens acquired {{the right to}} elect their magistrates and town councillors.
