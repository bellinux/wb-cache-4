5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 {{at the behest}} of the Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate decided to have a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified</b> marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd had stabilised with a line-up of Barrett, Waters, Mason and Wright by mid-1965, {{and after}} {{frequent}} gigging that year became regulars on the underground live circuit in London. While Barrett was the dominant member, writing most material, singing most lead vocals and playing lead guitar, Wright played a supportive role, playing keyboards and singing, with occasional lead, and writing his own material. As <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified</b> musician, Wright {{was responsible for}} tuning guitars, and would often tune Waters' bass for him in concert. Later on, he had a Strobotuner to tune guitars silently during gigs. In the band's early days, before acquiring a full-time road crew, Wright was responsible for unloading the gear {{at the end of}} each gig.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{also created}} or reorganized several {{government}} agencies. In cooperation with Pennsylvania governor James H. Duff, {{he created the}} Ohio River Sanitation Commission (ORANSCO) to combat pollution in the Ohio River and its tributaries. He curbed fraud in the insurance industry by reorganizing the state Insurance Commission and hiring a national prominent expert to rewrite the state's entire insurance code. To assist the General Assembly in writing more effective and efficient legislation, Clements created the non-partisan Legislative Research Commission, stocked with professionals from various disciplines, to conduct governmental research. He created the Kentucky Agriculture and Industrial Board (the predecessor of the current Kentucky Department of Commerce), which attracted 250 new industries {{to the state and}} created 40,000 new jobs during its first three years. He also created the Kentucky Building Commission to manage and plan all new state buildings. Among the commission's first projects were a new $6million capitol annex and {{the construction of a new}} state fairgrounds. To retain <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified</b> government employees, he supported a constitutional amendment that quadrupled the minimum annual salary for state employees from $5,000 to $20,000.|$|E

Scully subsequently learns that the Bureau's newly promoted deputy director, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), has launched a manhunt in search for Mulder. The investigation is being led by an FBI special agent named John Doggett. Scully and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) are taken to the task force's field office to be questioned, despite protests {{that they would be}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified</b> to lead the manhunt themselves. As Skinner is being interrogated, Scully is accosted by an unnamed person who starts asking her about Mulder. When Scully finds out that he is actually Doggett (Robert Patrick), she angrily throws water in his face and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified.</b> Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E

He also announced that the hereditary line of succession for the Patriarchy which had existed for 500 years was discontinued with his tenure, allowing any cleric from the Church of the East to be elevated to Catholicos-Patriarch.|$|E

25|$|Sir Humphrey represents, in many ways, {{the perfect}} technocrat. He is pompous, arrogant, elitist and regards his less-well-educated {{minister}} with some contempt. He frequently uses both his {{mastery of the}} English language and even his superb grasp of Latin and Greek grammar to perplex his political master and to obscure relevant issues under discussion. However, his habit of using language {{as a tool of}} confusion and obstruction is so deeply ingrained that he is sometimes unable to speak clearly and directly even in circumstances in which he honestly wishes to make himself clearly understood. He genuinely believes that the Civil Service knows what the average person needs and is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified</b> body to run the country, the joke being not only that Sir Humphrey, as a high-ranking Oxford-educated Civil Servant, is quite {{out of touch with the}} average person but also that the Civil Service judges what is 'best for Britain' to be that which in actuality is best for the Civil Service. Jim Hacker, on the other hand, tends to regard what is best for Britain as being whatever is best for his political party or his own chances of re-election. As a result, Sir Humphrey and Hacker often clash.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the TAT contracting process and its bypassing of a formal RFP process is premised on the business model of the DTIC IAC program. Specifically, contractors must compete {{for the opportunity to}} operate an IAC. This is a full open competition, and award is based on the capability of the contractor to perform software-aligned technical areas tasks, as well as to perform the core functions of maintaining software-focused libraries and developing a software center of excellence. When bidding on an IAC, contractors form collaborative teams to ensure the best overall coverage of the domain. Therefore, the contractor operating the DACS has already competed for the right for their team to perform TATs. The DACS contractor manages all TATs, insuring that any scientific and technical information (STI) resulting from the TAT is added to the DACS collection for dissemination in appropriate venues. When the government wishes to acquire the services of someone other than the DACS contractor, it is done as a TAT based on a subcontracting arrangement between the service provider (team member or other) and the DACS contractor. This business model gives the government a great deal of flexibility in working with DACS to acquire the services from <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>qualified</b> organizations. This is especially true in scenarios where the technical expertise needed resides within a small group in an academic institution, or a small business.|$|E
