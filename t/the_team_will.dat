On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>will</b> get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|Easter Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated that trial matches could be played at Easter Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term. It has since been announced that <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>will</b> move to Myreside from January 2017.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows <b>the</b> <b>team</b> <b>will</b> be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E
