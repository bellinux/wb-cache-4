Daily Telegraph called him [...] "unifying figure"in July 2, 2006; [...] "Amir Abbas Fakhravar, 30, has become the poster child of some of the leading neo-conservatives in Washington and, less than two months after leaving Iran, the former medical student who spent five years in jail and still bears the scars on his youthful face, is being championed as the person who can unite his country's fractious opposition." [...] Also, Michael Ledeen, an AEI scholar and Iran expert who co-hosted the lunch with Richard Perle, said of Mr Fakhravar: [...] "He's a unifying figure. He's strong physically and psychologically.

2500|$|Kumiko is {{revealed}} to be missing {{at the start of}} the second part, [...] "Bird as Prophet." [...] Shortly after, Toru finds out through a meeting with Noboru and Malta that Kumiko has apparently been spending time with another man and wants to end her relationship with Toru. Confused, Toru tries several things to calm himself and <b>think</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> situation: talking and taking up work with May Kasahara, hiding at the bottom of the well, and loitering around the city looking at people. Work with May involves tallying up people with some degree of baldness at a subway line for a wig company. While at the bottom of the well (of the abandoned house), Toru reminisces about earlier times with Kumiko, including their first date to an aquarium where they looked at jellyfish. He also experiences a dreamlike sequence where he enters a hotel room and speaks with a woman, and notices a strange blue mark on his cheek after he leaves the well. While loitering in the city, he spends most of the day sitting outside a donut shop and people-watching. Through this activity Toru encounters a well-dressed woman and also a singer he recognizes from his past, whom he follows and beats with a bat after getting ambushed by him.|$|E
