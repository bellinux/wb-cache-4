5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> and the present day. The most significant architect of the early <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the <b>twentieth</b> <b>century.</b> In {{the early decades of the}} century, traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E

5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early <b>twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents in the early <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> to 16,178 in 2001.
