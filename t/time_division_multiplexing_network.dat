In this paper, we show that the difference in performances between slotted and unslotted networks is mainly {{due to the fact that}} unslotted networks cannot easily perform such local optimization. We also show that minimizing locally the number of deflections in unslotted networks gives rise to an NP-complete problem. To overcome this problem, we have designed a heuristic whose aim is to limit locally the number of deflections. We experimentally demonstrate that this heuristic enhances unslotted routing almost at the same performance level as slotted routing.

It is intended that the thesis will {{form the basis}} of comparison between optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> <b>networks</b> and the more mature approach of wavelength <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> <b>networks.</b> Following an introduction to optical networking concepts, the required component technologies are discussed. In particular various optical pulse sources are described with the demanding restrictions of optical multiplexing in mind. This is followed by a discussion of the construction of multiplexers and demultiplexers, including favoured techniques for high speed clock recovery. Theoretical treatments of the performance of Mach Zehnder and electroabsorption modulators support the design criteria that are established for the construction of simple optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> systems. Having established appropriate end terminals for an optical network, the thesis examines transmission issues associated with high speed RZ data signals. Propagation of RZ signals over both installed (standard fibre) and newly commissioned fibre routes are considered in turn. In the case of standard fibre systems, the use of dispersion compensation is summarised, and the application of mid span spectral inversion experimentally investigated. For green field sites, soliton like propagation of high speed data signals is demonstrated. In this case the particular restrictions of high speed soliton systems are discussed and experimentally investigated, namely the increasing impact of timing jitter and the downward pressure on repeater spacings due to the constraint of the average soliton model. These issues are each addressed through investigations of active soliton control for OTDM systems and through investigations of novel fibre types respectively. Finally the particularly remarkable networking potential of optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> systems is established, and infinite node cascadability using soliton control is demonstrated. A final comparison of the various technologies for optical multiplexing is presented in the conclusions, where the relative merits of the technologies for optical networking emerges as the key differentiator between technologies...|$|R

The spontaneous emission noise output of the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) contained in the TOAD is simulated under different degrees of saturation. The analysis indicates that leakage due to the asymmetric placement of the SOA contributes significantly to the crosstalk. To achieve a SNR of 21. 5 dB or higher in a 100 Gb/s system, one must use a 2 × 2 coupler that deviates less than 1 % from a perfect 3 dB splitting ratio. Also, control pulse energy fluctuations must be less than 10 % for a 20 -GHz bandwidth electronic receiver.

This Letter presents an all-optical add-drop multiplexing method at 4 40 Gbit=s using a commercially available highly-nonlinear fibre (HNLF). The advantage of using HNLF as a nonlinear switching medium is the possibility of realising high speed operation (up to 640 Gbit=s) owing to the ultrafast fibre response time.

This research begins by comparing the performance of circuit-switching and TCP/IP (which is most commonly used in the Internet) when bulk data is transferred.

Circuit-switching suffers from the drawback that connections at rates higher than DS 0 (64 Kbps) can only be obtained in provisioned mode.

40|$|The current optical {{communications}} network consists of point-to-point optical transmission paths interconnected with relatively low-speed electronic switching and routing devices. As {{the demand for}} capacity increases, then higher speed electronic devices will become necessary. It is however hard to realise electronic chip-sets above 10 Gbit/s, and therefore to increase the achievable performance of the network, electro-optic and all-optic switching and routing architectures are being investigated. This thesis aims to provide a detailed experimental analysis of high-speed optical processing within an optical <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> (OTDM) <b>network</b> node. This includes the functions of demultiplexing, 'drop and insert' multiplexing, data regeneration, and clock recovery. It examines the possibilities of combining these tasks using a single device. Two optical switching technologies are explored. The first is an all-optical device known as 'semiconductor optical amplifier-based nonlinear optical loop mirror' (SOA-NOLM). Switching is achieved by using an intense 'control' pulse to induce a phase shift in a low-intensity signal propagating through an interferometer. Simultaneous demultiplexing, data regeneration and clock recovery are demonstrated {{for the first time}} using a single SOA-NOLM. The second device is an electroabsorption (EA) modulator, which until this thesis had been used in a uni-directional configuration to achieve picosecond pulse generation, data encoding, demultiplexing, and 'drop and insert' multiplexing. This thesis presents results on the use of an EA modulator in a novel bi-directional configuration. Two independent channels are demultiplexed from a high-speed OTDM data stream using a single device. Simultaneous demultiplexing with stable, ultra-low jitter clock recovery is demonstrated, and then used in a self-contained 40 Gbit/s 'drop and insert' node.

This bottleneck was the result of two major factors, the inherent cost sensitivity of access networks that impedes deployment of new optical technology prior to cost maturity, and the lack of popularized new broadband services that would demand from the access network bandwidth higher than broadband that digital subscriber lines or cable could deliver. Nevertheless, the bandwidth landscape at the access is changing and it has been widely recognized that optical is the technology that can efficiently address the current and future bandwidth needs of the access network. In order to also meet low-cost objectives, it has been recognized that the optical technology should be mostly limited to passive culminating to a passive optical access network (PON).

Residue jitter free operation up to 80 Gb/s has been demonstrated which is in good agreement with the phase noise analysis included in this work. ^ The characteristics of the actively mode-locked fiber lasers is also studied in depth in this thesis work. A time domain circulating pulse model has been proposed to study the pulse width optimization problem as well as the output amplitude equalization problem associated with rational harmonic mode-locking. By proposing a cascaded modulator as the cavity loss modulator, amplitude equalized pulse train operating at 80 Gb/s has been obtained, which represents the highest order of rational harmonic mode-locking with amplitude equalized output ever reported so far. The dispersion effect on the detuning characteristics of the mode-locked fiber lasers is also studied. An analytic formula is derived which is capable of predicting the saturation effects associated with large frequency detunings. The analytic results obtained are well supported by both the numerical and the experimental investigations. By using the self-biased LiNbO 3 modulator as an artificial intensity dependent loss element, nearly 20 dB suppression of the relaxation oscillation noise peak has been demonstrated. Based on the linearized rate equation approach, a theory for the laser AM noise suppression has been developed. The jitter problem for harmonic mode-locked fiber lasers is also studied in the frequency domain. It is shown in this work that the super-mode noise contributes significantly to the timing jitter of the produced pulse train which explains the recent experimental observations well. Finally, as a connection between the clock recovery technique and the mode-locked fiber lasers, we extend the regenerative type mode-locking technique from the traditional harmonic region to the current rational harmonic region. In addition, {{with the help of a}} novel external repetition rate doubler based on the polarization maintaining fiber loop mirror, a highly stable pulse train operating at 80 Gb/s has been obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a study {{and analysis of}} the major influences on network cost and their related performance. New methods have been devised to find solutions to network optimisation problems particular to the AT&T ISTEL networks in Europe and these are presented together with examples of their successful commercial application. Network performance is seen by the user in terms of network availability and traffic delay times. The network performance is influenced by many parameters, the dominating influences typically being the number of users accessing the network, the type of traffic demands they place upon it and the particular network configuration itself. The number of possible network configurations available to a network designer is vast if the full range of currently available equipment is taken into account. The aim of this research has been to assist in the selection of most suitable network designs for optimum performance and cost. This thesis looks at the current differing network technologies, their performance characteristics and the issues pertinent to any network design and optimisation procedures. A distinction is made between the network equipment providing user 'access' and that which constitutes the cross country, or *core data transport medium. This partitioning of the problem is exploited with the analysis concentrating on each section separately. The access side of the AT&T ISTEL - UK network is used as a basis for an analysis of the general access network. The aim is to allow network providers to analyse the root cause of excessive delay problems and find where small adjustments to access configurations might lead to real performance improvements from a user point of view. A method is developed to allow statistical estimates of performance and quality of service for typical access network configurations. From this a general method for the optimisation of cost expenditure and performance improvement is proposed. The optimisation of both circuit switched and packet switched computer networks is shown to be difficult and is normally tackled by the use of complex procedures on mainframe computers. The new work carried out in this study takes a fresh look at the basic properties of networks in order to develop a new heuristic method for the design and optimisation of circuit switched core networks on a personal computer platform. A fully functional design system was developed that implements <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> core <b>network</b> design. The system uses both a new heuristic method for improving the quality of the designs and a new 'speed up' algorithm for reducing times to find feasible routes, thereby dramatically improving overall design times. The completed system has since been used extensively to assist in the design of commercial networks across Europe. AT&T ISTEL Ltd., Redditch, Englan...|$|R
40|$|Optical fibers {{have brought}} fast and {{reliable}} data transmission to today’s network. The immense fiber build-out {{over the last}} few years has generated a wide array of new access technologies, transport and network protocols, and next-generation services in the Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN). All these different technologies, protocols, and services were introduced to address particular telecommunication needs. To remain competitive in the market, the service providers must offer most of these services, while maintaining their own profitability. However, offering a large variety of equipment, protocols, and services posses a big challenge for service carriers because it requires a huge investment in different technology platforms, lots of training of staff, and the management of all these networks. In today’s network, service providers use SONET (Synchronous Optical NETwork) as a basic TDM (<b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplexing)</b> transport <b>network.</b> SONET was primarily designed to carry voice traffic from telephone networks. However, with the explosion of traffic in the Internet, the same SONET based TDM network is optimized to support increasing demand for packet based Internet network services (data, voice, video, teleconference etc.) at access networks and LANs. Therefore the service providers need to support their Internet Protocol (IP) infrastructure as well as in the legacy telephony infrastructure. Supporting both TDM and packet services in the present condition needs multilayer operations which is complex, expensive, and difficult to manage. A hybrid switch is a novel architecture that combines packets (IP) and TDM switching in a unified access platform and provides seamless integration of access networks and LANs with MAN/WAN networks. The ability to fully integrate these two capabilities in a single chassis will allow service providers to deploy a more cost effective and flexible architecture that can support a variety of different services. This thesis develops a hybrid switch which is capable of offering bundled services for TDM switching and packet routing. This is done by dividing the switch’s bandwidth into VT 1. 5 (Virtual Tributary - 1. 5) channels and providing SONET based signaling for routing the data and controlling the switch’s resources. The switch is a TDM based architecture which allows each switch’s port to be independently configured for any mixture of packet and TDM traffic, including 100 % packet and 100 % TDM. This switch allows service providers to simplify their edge networks by consolidating the number of separate boxes needed to provide fast and reliable access. This switch also reduces the number of network management systems needed, and decreases the resources needed to install, provision and maintain the network because of its ability to “collapse” two network layers into one platform. The scope of this thesis includes system architecture, logic implementation, and verification testing, and performance evaluation of the hybrid switch. The architecture consists of ingress/egress ports, an arbiter and a crossbar. Data from ingress ports is carried to the egress ports via VT 1. 5 channels which are switched at the cross point of the crossbar. The crossbar setup and channel assignments at ingress port are done by the arbiter. The design was tested by simulation and the hardware cost was estimated. The performance results showed that the switch is non-blocking, provide differentiated service, and has an overall effective throughput of 80 %. This result is a significant step towards the goal of building a switch that can support multiprotocol and provide different network capabilities into one platform. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a prototype of the hybrid switch with broadband capability...|$|R
