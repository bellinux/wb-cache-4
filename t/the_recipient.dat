5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E

None of <b>the</b> <b>recipients</b> of 18 -d-old embryos splenic lobes exhibited a long-term improvement of the diabetic state after transplantation.
