The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E

Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
