5|$|NY177 {{begins at}} interchange42 on I-81 {{in the town}} of Adams. The route {{progresses}} away from the interstate to the southeast, passing the former railroad station in Adams Center before intersecting with US11 in the center of <b>the</b> <b>hamlet.</b> At this intersection, NY177 turns eastward, leaving the populated hamlet for a rural backdrop and into <b>the</b> <b>hamlet</b> of Honeyville. Honeyville consists of little more than a few houses centered on the intersection of NY177 and Fuller Road. After leaving Honeyville, NY177 intersects with CR155, where it turns to the southeast into the town of Rodman.
