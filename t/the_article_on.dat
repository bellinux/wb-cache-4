5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>on</b> these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

Suharto sued the magazine seeking more than $US 27 billion in damages for libel over <b>the</b> <b>article.</b> <b>On</b> 10 September 2007, Indonesia's Supreme Court awarded Suharto damages against Time Asia magazine, ordering it {{to pay him}} one trillion rupiah ($128.59 million). The High Court reversed the judgement of an appellate court and Central Jakarta district court (made in 2000 and 2001).|$|E

5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>on</b> line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E

The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E

5|$|Nuka-Worlds {{release date}} of August 30, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was {{announced}} in a post on the Bethesda Game Studios blog on August 15,. along with the expansion's trailer. Bethesda started releasing keys for the beta version on August 16 and pre-release gameplay was live streamed through Twitch.tv on August 23, with the official trailer coming out two days later. The expansion has a larger file size than Far Harbor, being 3.66 GB as opposed to 2.69 GB. This resulted in people wondering if Nuka-World would contain more gameplay, although the price implied it would be somewhere between Automatron and Far Harbor. The North American release of Nuka-World on PlayStation 4 was delayed due to unknown problems. Unlike the PS4 launch of Far Harbor, no major stability or frame-rate issues were found while playing, except when inside a location called The Galactic Zone. In <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>on</b> the website Push Square, {{it was noted that}} the cause of the frame-rate issues in The Galactic Zone were unknown and were not consistent.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli had a {{profound}} influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to have convinced Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which {{changed the course of}} the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the Forty-two Articles. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the Book of Common Prayer of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>on</b> predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli's theology was arguably more influential than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in the controversies of this period.|$|E
