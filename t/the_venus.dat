5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> of Brassempouy and <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and it is unknown how this was achieved.|$|E

5|$|Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos' {{group to}} the Mercury Lighthouse, joined by Ivan and Mia. Despite their best efforts, they fail to prevent Saturos from {{activating}} Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star. Saturos' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac's party remaining in pursuit. In the ensuing chase, Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage: the female Jupiter Adept, Sheba. Saturos and Menardi activate <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> Lighthouse with <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> Star, and are confronted by Isaac's party immediately thereafter. Attempting to annihilate their opponents, Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two-headed dragon, but Isaac's party slay Saturos and Menardi. Directly following this, Sheba falls from the lighthouse and Felix proceeds to jump out after her. The remnants of Saturos' group (unbeknownst to the players until Golden Sun: The Lost Age), headed by Felix and Alex, continue their quest to light the remaining two Lighthouses, with Jenna, Sheba, and Kraden still with them. The game ends as Isaac's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard's open seas to continue their mission.|$|E
5|$|The Dresden Codex {{contains}} accurate astronomical tables, {{which are}} recognized by {{students of the}} codex for its detailed Venus tables and lunar tables.

The codex also contains astrological tables and ritual schedules. The religious references show in a cycle of a 260-day ritual calendar the important Maya royal events. The codex also includes information on the Maya new-year ceremony tradition. The rain god Chaac is represented 134 times.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Venus</b> Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side.

In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E

5|$|The astronomical {{symbol for}} Venus {{is the same}} as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath. <b>The</b> <b>Venus</b> symbol also {{represents}} femininity, and in Western alchemy stood for the metal copper. Polished copper has been used for mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to stand for the mirror of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|The pose of Musidora {{is based}} on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> de' Medici. It is {{possible}} that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection.|$|E
5|$|The red {{and white}} variety of toy spaniel was first seen in {{paintings}} by Titian, including <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> of Urbino (1538), where a small dog {{is used as a}} symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.|$|E

5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E

5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of {{misinformation}} disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited {{by the idea of}} leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London.|$|E
5|$|The Greek, Etruscan, and Roman {{department}} displays {{pieces from}} the Mediterranean Basin dating from the Neolithic to the 6thcentury. The collection spans from the Cycladic period to {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire. This department is one of the museum's oldest; it began with appropriated royal art, some of which was acquired under Francis I. Initially, the collection focused on marble sculptures, such as <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> de Milo. Works such as the Apollo Belvedere arrived during the Napoleonic Wars, but these pieces were returned after Napoleon I's fall in 1815. In the 19thcentury, the Louvre acquired works including vases from the Durand collection, bronzes such as the Borghese Vase from the Bibliothèque nationale.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including The Winged Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and <b>the</b> <b>Venus</b> de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E
