50|$|In February 1997, {{prosecutors}} {{dropped the}} DeSimone and DiLorenzo murder charges and offered Bellomo {{a chance to}} plead guilty <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> payoffs from a construction union and a garbage hauling company. Bellomo accepted the deal {{and was sentenced to}} 10 years in prison.|$|R

5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|Two Supreme Court justices had {{previously}} disagreed {{on this question}} while riding circuit. In United States v. Ravara (C.C.D. Pa. 1793), an indictment for sending anonymous and threatening letters to a foreign minister with a view <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money, Justice James Wilson argued that the circuit court could be given concurrent jurisdiction; Justice James Iredell argued that it could not; Judge Richard Peters, of the District of Pennsylvania, sided with Wilson, and the case continued.|$|E
5|$|After the mission, it is {{revealed}} that Sawamura planned to collect bribes from Megatech {{in exchange for}} covering up a defect in the nuclear reactor, which was going to explode, and presenting it as a terrorist attack; however, Zebra seized the reactor to take it over and wanted <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money from Sawamura. Kusanagi declares the entire experience as at least good training for the Rookie and acknowledges the Rookie's cleverness, but criticizes the overdependence on the Fuchikoma.|$|E
50|$|Cammarano {{pleaded guilty}} on April 20, 2010 <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> cash {{contributions}} {{in return for}} official influence and admitted accepting $25,000 in illicit cash contributions in exchange for exercising his future official influence and authority. Cammarano remained free on a $100,000 bond pending his sentence. The guilty plea effectively ended his political career; New Jersey, like most states, does not allow convicted felons to hold office.|$|R
50|$|Since 2002, {{under the}} Mwai Kibaki presidency, {{politically}} motivated {{human rights violations}} have diminished, but other serious human rights abuses persist, a great many {{at the hands of}} security forces, particularly the police. The police force is widely viewed as the most corrupt entity in the country, given <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> bribes, complicity in criminal activity, and using excessive force against both criminal suspects and crowds. Most police who commit abuses still do so with impunity. Prison conditions remain life-threatening.|$|R
50|$|Operation Bid Rig {{originated}} with investigations of public corruption among New Jersey officials in Monmouth and Ocean counties. The first phase became public in 2002 when former Ocean Township Mayor Terrance D. Weldon pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> cash from developers {{to influence the}} approval of building projects. The {{second phase of the}} investigation resulted in the February 2005 arrests of 11 elected officials in Monmouth County, who were charged with taking bribes from an undercover cooperating witness.|$|R
5|$|En {{route to}} his weekly squash game, a traffic {{diversion}} reminds Perowne of the anti-war protests occurring that day. After being allowed through the diversion, he collides with another car, damaging its wing mirror. At first the driver, Baxter, tries <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money from him. When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly recognises the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1978, Chaplin's coffin was dug up {{and stolen}} from its grave by two {{unemployed}} immigrants, Roman Wardas, from Poland, and Gantcho Ganev, from Bulgaria. The body {{was held for}} ransom in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money from Oona Chaplin. The pair were caught in a large police operation in May, and Chaplin's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of Noville. It was re-interred in the Corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, {{investigators}} started Operation GamBat, an extensive investigation into decades {{of corruption and}} mob ties inside the Chicago court system. In February 1990, fearing prosecution from his actions during the 1977 Logan trial, retired judge Frank Wilson shot himself to death at his Arizona retirement home. In 1991, Aleman pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> money from bookmakers Anthony Reitinger and Vince Rizza in 1972. Aleman was convicted {{and was sentenced to}} 12 years imprisonment. In 1993, based on Robert Cooley's testimony, Aleman was re-indicted for the 1972 Logan slaying.|$|R
50|$|Douglas D. Green, {{known as}} Doug Green (born c. 1950), {{is the former}} Louisiana {{insurance}} commissioner who held the office from 1988 to 1991, when he received a 25-year federal sentence for taking $2 million in illegal campaign contributions from owners of insurance companies {{doing business with the}} state. Green's predecessor and fellow Democrat Sherman A. Bernard, whom he unseated in the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary, pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> bribes disguised as campaign contributions and served forty-one months during the middle 1990s in a federal prison in Alabama.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> {{businesses and}} attempting to destroy rival families, the player must also engage in story missions. Completing story missions {{is the only way}} for the player to advance in rank in the Corleone family, moving from Outsider through the ranks of Enforcer, Associate, Soldier, Capo, Underboss, Don and, finally, Don of NYC. However, completing all of the storyline missions will only take the player to the level of Underboss. To achieve the Don of NYC level, the player must take over all rival businesses, rackets, warehouses, and hubs, destroy all compounds, and own every safehouse.|$|R
5|$|On 3 September 2012 {{prominent}} Real IRA member Alan Ryan {{was shot}} dead in Dublin. Gardaí believed he {{had been involved in}} a feud with major crime gangs from whom he was trying <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money. Following Ryan's death an internal feud developed in the Real IRA. Ryan's replacement as leader and another associate were shot and wounded in November 2012, allegedly on the orders of the Northern leadership. In March 2013, another prominent former Real IRA member, Peter Butterly from Dunleer, {{was shot dead}}; three Dublin men, allegedly from the Alan Ryan faction, were charged with his murder and Real IRA membership.|$|E
5|$|The {{recorded}} {{conversation was}} a critical aspect of Jackson's defense against the upcoming allegation made against him. He and his supporters argue {{that he was the}} victim of a jealous father whose only goal was <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money from the singer. In October 1994, Mary A. Fischer of GQ magazine reported it was Evan Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, before he demanded a screenwriting deal from Jackson instead of going to the police.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, 2006, one of Ono's bodyguards {{was arrested}} {{after he was}} {{allegedly}} taped trying <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> $2million from her. The tapes revealed that he threatened to release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he {{pleaded not guilty to}} two counts of attempted grand larceny. In February 16, 2007 a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.|$|E
50|$|Güemes {{was then}} left {{to his own}} devices, as San Martín was forced to stay in Chile {{for three years and}} Belgrano was {{recalled}} to Santa Fe Province to fight the federalist supporters of José Gervasio Artigas on behalf of the centralist government of Buenos Aires, now presided by Rondeau. In March 1819 a new royalist army invaded the northwest of Argentina. Güemes did not obtain reinforcements and resorted <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> money by force from the upper-class landowners of Salta. In February 1820 another wave of Spanish troops invaded San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, but were eventually repelled.|$|R

5|$|Van der Sloot's cell {{became the}} target of a media circus, with reporters vying to gain {{exclusive}} access and report about his prison surroundings. Since his incarceration, he has only consented to interviews to De Telegraaf, in which he admitted <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> the Holloway family and said that he received a number of marriage proposals in his cell, including one from a woman who wanted to have his child. Van der Sloot reportedly receives fan mail from around the world, though mostly from women residing in the United States and the Netherlands. According to sources within the prison, Van der Sloot sought $1 million in exchange for an on-camera interview.|$|R
5|$|Salander, who {{is under}} state legal {{guardianship}} due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing {{she has a}} hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a taser, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with a tattoo {{on his chest and}} stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E
5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, {{which is why he}} could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, {{sitting down}} {{with a hint of}} {{defiance}} in her air, [...] "that's the most important thing; though the confession had <b>to</b> be <b>extorted</b> from you. It looked as if you {{wanted to get rid of}} me." ...|$|R
50|$|King John is {{recorded}} as having stayed the night, on 18 January 1201, {{while on a}} tour of Lincolnshire. During his brief reign from 6 April 1199 until his death in 1216, he's said <b>to</b> have <b>extorted</b> 1,680 marks (£1,120) from the abbey.|$|R
50|$|On February 7, 2008, D'Amico {{was arrested}} {{along with more}} than 60 {{affiliates}} of the Gambino family after Operation Old Bridge picked up an informant named Joseph Vollaro. The operation went on to terminate the drug trafficking between the Gambino crime family in New York and their connections in Sicily. While D'Amico was placed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, Corozzo became a fugitive. On March 14, 2008, D'Amico was released on bail from the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York. Following the indictments from Operation Old Bridge, D'Amico was still on trial regarding multiple counts of racketeering charges. In May, 2008, D'Amico pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>extorting</b> a cement company out of $100,000 and was sentenced on August 18, 2008 {{to two years in}} prison at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.|$|R
5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign {{the king}} ceased to borrow from the Jewish {{community}} and instead turned to an aggressive campaign of tallage taxation and fines. Financial and anti-Semite violence grew under RichardI. After the massacre of the York community, in which numerous financial records were destroyed, seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> money from the Jewish community, imprisoning the wealthier members, including Isaac of Norwich, until a huge, new taillage was paid. During the Baron's War of 1215–17, the Jews were subjected to fresh anti-Semitic attacks. HenryIII restored some order and Jewish money-lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation. The Jewish community became poorer {{towards the end of}} the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being largely replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June, Wrawe {{attacked}} Sir Richard Lyons' {{property at}} Overhall, advancing on to Cavendish and Bury St Edmunds in west Suffolk the next day, gathering further support as they went. John Cambridge, the Prior {{of the wealthy}} Bury St Edmunds Abbey, was disliked in the town, and Wrawe allied himself with the townspeople and stormed the abbey. The Prior escaped, but was found two days later and beheaded. A small band of rebels marched north to Thetford <b>to</b> <b>extort</b> protection money from the town, and another group tracked down Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Cavendish was caught in Lakenheath and killed. John Battisford and Thomas Sampson independently led a revolt near Ipswich on 14 June. They took the town without opposition and looted {{the properties of the}} archdeacon and local tax officials. The violence spread out further, with attacks on many properties and the burning of the local court records. One official, Edmund Lakenheath, was forced to flee from the Suffolk coast by boat.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Hollins {{sponsored}} the legislation which created the Sabine River water diversion project. In 1978, he chaired a legislative committee which investigated state Insurance commissioner Sherman A. Bernard. In 1993, Bernard confessed <b>to</b> having <b>extorted</b> during the 1980s $80,000, disguised as campaign contributions, from insurance companies {{in return for}} obtaining operating licenses in Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|Analysis of data {{which became}} {{available}} after {{the network was}} taken down indicated that about 1.3% of those infected had paid the ransom; many {{had been able to}} recover files which had been backed up, and others are believed to have lost huge amounts of data. Nonetheless, the gang was believed <b>to</b> have <b>extorted</b> about US$3m.|$|R
5000|$|However, Cornero's success soon brought {{unwanted}} attention. Charles [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano, {{boss of the}} New York Luciano {{crime family}} and his associates, casino owner Meyer Lansky, demanded a percentage of Cornero's gaming profits. Cornero refused <b>to</b> be <b>extorted</b> and the Meadows was eventually torched. Cornero sold his Las Vegas interests and moved back to Los Angeles.|$|R
