5|$|Some {{had said}} that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where {{children}} from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of <b>the</b> <b>database</b> could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate of the cost of <b>the</b> <b>database.</b> The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted <b>the</b> <b>database</b> to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

40|$|Faculty {{awareness}} {{and use of}} Library subscribed online <b>databases</b> in <b>the</b> University of Education, Winneba, Ghana: A survey. Today electronic <b>databases</b> have become <b>the</b> backbone of many academic libraries around the globe including Ghana. This {{is largely due to}} its advantages over the print resources. Libraries spend colossal amount of resources on online databases in a bid to enhance teaching, learning and research in institutions of higher learning. This study was carried out to examine the usage of online databases by faculty members of the University of Education, Winneba. It focuses on only the Winneba campus to address the following objectives among others; explore the awareness level of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> <b>the</b> university subscribes to and {{to determine the extent of}} use and the relevance of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> by faculty. Four research questions were formulated to guide the study. The study was a survey and made use of questionnaire to elicit data from the respondents. A sample population of 210 was given questionnaires bearing in mind the research questions which guided the study. Data was analysed using frequencies and simple percentages. The results of the study revealed that majority of respondents were aware of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> though there were few of them who did not know the existence of <b>the</b> <b>databases.</b> It further established that a number of faculty members who utilise <b>the</b> <b>databases,</b> had knowledge of some of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> and use them mainly for research and other educational activities. However, the results indicated that though faculty acknowledges the importance of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> to their information needs, there were few hindrances that inhibit their effective use of <b>the</b> <b>databases,</b> these were; no access to <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> outside <b>the</b> campus, often passwords to some databases not functioning, and issues bothering on internet connectivity. The paper ends with recommendations to ensure effective and efficient use of <b>the</b> <b>databases...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>database,</b> created {{under the}} Children Act 2004, cost £224m {{to set up}} and £41m a year to run. It {{operated}} in 150 local authorities, and was accessible to at least 330,000 users. <b>The</b> <b>database</b> was heavily criticised by a wide range of groups, mainly for privacy, security and child protection reasons. On 12 May 2010 the new UK Coalition Government announced plans to scrap ContactPoint and on 6 August 2010 <b>the</b> <b>database</b> was shut down. From that date the Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007, as amended in 2010, no longer applies.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that <b>the</b> <b>database</b> complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>database,</b> the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design <b>the</b> <b>database.</b> On 15 February 2007, <b>the</b> <b>database</b> was renamed from Information Sharing Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including children and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>database</b> was: to improve communication between those working with children.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{awareness}} level and usage of electronic databases by graduate students in the University of Ghana. The focus was on graduate students of Departments of Geography and Development Resource, and Information Studies. Questionnaire was used to collect the data. The findings were that students were very much aware of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> available to them as indicated by 96. 9 %and 93. 8 % indicated to use them. The studies has also established that majority of students knew about <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> from their lecturers and most of them accessed from the central library. Despite the claimed usage level, databases they focused on were few and many of them were not familiar with those in their discipline of study. Further, the limited number of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> they knew about, they were satisfied with them and claimed <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> have impacted on their learning and research activities. In light of these findings it is recommended that librarians especially subject librarians should heighten the publicity of <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> and <b>the</b> research guides to both students and faculty so that they would become familiar with <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> and use them more and effectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{power of}} the WWW comes not simply from static HTML pages- which can be very attractive, but the {{important}} first step into the WWW is especially the ability to support those pages with powerful software, especially when interfacing to <b>databases.</b> <b>The</b> combination of attractive screen displays, exceptionally easy to use controls and navigational aids, and powerful underlying software, has opened up the potential for people everywhere {{to tap into the}} vast global information resources of the Internet [1]. There is a lot of data on the Web, some in databases, and some in files or other data sources. <b>The</b> <b>databases</b> may be semi structured or they may be relational, object, or multimedia databases. These databases have to be mined so that useful information is extracted. While we could use many of the data mining techniques to mine <b>the</b> Web <b>databases,</b> <b>the</b> challenge is to locate <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> on <b>the</b> Web. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>databases</b> may not be in the format that we need for mining the data.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 tropical storms, there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity. The first developed on June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression developed on July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. A tropical depression developed on July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as a tropical storm. Originally, there was a tropical storm in <b>the</b> <b>database</b> in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was a tropical storm in <b>the</b> <b>database</b> in late September, but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>database</b> {{would not}} hold case or {{assessment}} material or any subjective observations. <b>The</b> <b>database</b> could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E
