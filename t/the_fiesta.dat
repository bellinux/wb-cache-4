5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, they {{represented}} the Big12 Conference in <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl hosts the Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS eligible teams, the opponent. For 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos led the Sooners {{the majority of the}} game, but the Sooners made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, the Sooners had the Broncos in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but were stunned when the Broncos executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would be only the first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E
5|$|The at-large {{spot in the}} Orange Bowl {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose bowls) and the automatic bids. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls. In 2009, <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl picked first, followed by the Sugar Bowl, then the Orange Bowl. <b>The</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl picked Ohio State, while the Sugar Bowl selected Utah. The Orange Bowl was thus left to select Big East Conference champion Cincinnati, fulfilling the BCS' contractual obligation to provide a game for the conference's champion.|$|E

50|$|Consumption of {{traditional}} Chilean foods {{is one of}} the principal displays of <b>the</b> <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias. Chileans prepare these foods in their homes, or they go to fondas. Fondas are venues, often tents, prepared and decorated for <b>the</b> <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias where traditional Chilean dishes and beverages are served. The largest fondas are found in Parque O'Higgins. Each year the Chilean President kicks off <b>the</b> <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias celebrations at one of these locales. For many years, the selected fonda was La Grandiosa Bertita.The predominant food associated with <b>the</b> <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias are Chilean empanadas, which are a sort of bread pastry. The filling of these empanadas consist of pino, a mixture of chopped beef and onion, as well as half of a hard-boiled egg, raisins, and an olive. Many Chileans also throw a barbecue for <b>the</b> <b>Fiestas</b> Patrias. During this time sales of meat products exceed $50 million.|$|R
5|$|The Phoenix area hosts two annual college {{football}} bowl games: <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl, played at University of Phoenix Stadium, and the Motel 6 Cactus Bowl, which is held at Sun Devil Stadium (though Chase Field has substituted as host while ASU's football stadium undergoes renovations).|$|E
5|$|For the January 2011 games, the Sugar Bowl {{selected}} first, {{followed by}} the Orange Bowl and Fiesta Bowl. The Sugar Bowl picked Ohio State, which left the Orange Bowl to decide between two teams contractually bound to appear in a BCS bowl game. These were Stanford, which was guaranteed a BCS bid by its No. 4 national ranking, and Connecticut, champion of the Big East Conference. Favoring Stanford's potential to draw a large television audience, the Orange Bowl selected the Cardinal, leaving Connecticut to <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{opened the}} season with two non-conference wins, but lost to the UCF Knights, who {{ultimately}} {{went on to a}} BCS bowl, <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta,</b> in their third game.

5|$|The WindSeeker at Knott's Berry Farm {{differed}} from the other five in several ways. Rather than white, blue, and green on the tower, Knott's adopted a color scheme using orange, purple, and yellow to reflect the Spanish California theme of <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Village section of the park. The tower at Knott's had no lights at the top. The ride's sign had a Mexican theme and did not light up.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rivalry and bowl implications, this game also decided who would {{represent}} the South Division at the Big 12 Championship Game in Kansas City. At {{the beginning of}} the week, Texas and Oklahoma were tied for the lead with Texas holding the tie-breaker due to their win in the Red River Rivalry earlier in the year. However, since Texas lost to Texas A on November 24, a Sooner victory at State would win them the division outright and let them play Nebraska for the Big12 title and a spot in <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl (awarded contractually to the Big12 winner if they are not selected to play in the national championship game).|$|E

5|$|Conference play {{began with}} a loss to the Texas Longhorns in the annual Red River Rivalry on October 7, and ended with a win over the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the Big 12 Championship Game on December 2.

Construction was {{scheduled}} to begin around the same time at Knott's Berry Farm, where the Sky Cabin observation tower was to be removed to make way for it. On January 7, 2011, however, it was announced that their WindSeeker would not replace Sky Cabin but instead be located in <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Village section of the park. Work began almost immediately after this announcement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the start}} of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, President Manuel Quezon hired Paris-trained Filipino {{architect}} Andrés Luna de San Pedro, son of painter Juan Luna, to take charge of the renovations of the Manila Hotel.

The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth. Luna converted the hotel's top floor into an elegant penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the air-conditioned annex - and designed some key public rooms like <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Pavilion, then the biggest function room of the hotel. The hotel was the site of festivities during the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth government in November, 1935.|$|E

5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} was unclear {{due to the}} SEC championship game, which determined the conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, or Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Orange Bowl had {{the fourth}} and sixth {{selections}} from eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The Sugar Bowl had the top two picks, while <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl, which had the top picks in 1995, received the third and fifth picks. Due to Bowl Alliance restrictions, the Orange Bowl {{at the end of}} the 1996 season had to be played on December 31, marking the first time in the history of the Orange Bowl that the game was not played in January and that there were two Orange Bowls in the same year—one {{at the end of the}} 1995 season, and the other at the conclusion of the 1996 season. The only other time was in 2014, the first year of the college football playoffs.|$|E
5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 {{years with a}} victory in the 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished the season with a record of five wins and six losses and failed to qualify for a bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led the Crimson Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led the Crimson Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta,</b> Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led the Crimson Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami in the Sugar Bowl. In August 1995, as part of the penalty imposed by the NCAA for rules violations, Alabama was ruled ineligible to participate in the 1995 bowl season.|$|E

5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS national championship game. In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national championship game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and <b>the</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl. The national championship game rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl {{hosted the}} {{national}} championship game for the 1995 season, and thus had {{the first and second}} pick of eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The Orange Bowl had the third and fifth selections, while the Sugar Bowl had the fourth and sixth picks. The three Bowl Alliance games each were assigned a different date: December 31, January 1, or January 2. The dates rotated among the three games, along with which game would host {{the national championship}}. The Sugar Bowl was assigned the December 31 date, marking the first time it had been held on that date instead of its traditional January 1 date since December 31, 1975. From December 31, 1972, to December 31, 1975, the game was held on New Year's Eve. Thus, there were two games held during the calendar year 1972 and none in calendar year 1976. There were also two games in calendar year 1995, but since then the game has been held on or after January 1 following the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the loss}} to Miami knocked the Hokies out of {{contention}} for the Big East championship and its accompanying automatic BCS bid, there was the possibility that Tech could receive an at-large BCS game bid if it scored high enough in the final BCS poll and the administrators of a BCS game wanted to invite the Hokies. Tech was considered a long shot due to the availability of Oregon State and Notre Dame, two teams with large followings that would attract greater television revenue and ticket sales. Gator Bowl officials made plans based on different possibilities. If Virginia Tech was selected for a BCS bowl but Notre Dame was not, the Fighting Irish would play in the Gator Bowl. If both were selected, Big East No. 3 Pittsburgh would be given the nod for the Gator Bowl. On December 3, the BCS selections were announced: <b>The</b> <b>Fiesta</b> Bowl selected No. 5 Oregon State and No. 10 Notre Dame instead of No. 6 Virginia Tech. This left the Hokies available for the Gator Bowl, which picked them on the next day.|$|E
