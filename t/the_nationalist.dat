5|$|In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos {{used the}} Rhoads scandal {{as part of}} his anti-colonial campaign, {{attracting}} followers to <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> movement.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of FRELIMO, the Soviet position regarding <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> movements in Mozambique was one of confusion. There were multiple independence movements, and they had no sure knowledge that any would succeed. <b>The</b> <b>nationalist</b> groups in Mozambique, like those across Africa during the period, received training and equipment from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of independence, Armenia was Sovietized in December 1920. During the 1921 February Uprising Etchmiadzin was briefly (until April) taken over by <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which had {{dominated}} the pre-Soviet Armenian government between 1918 and 1920.|$|E
25|$|After the {{occupation}} of Mérida and Badajoz, <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> connected <b>the</b> Nationalist-held northern zone and the southern zone. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> occupied <b>the</b> western half of the province of Badajoz and the Republican government {{lost control of the}} Portuguese frontier. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalists</b> carried out harsh repression in the conquered territory. Between 6,600 and 12,000 Republican supporters were executed by <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> (<b>the</b> Republicans had executed 243 Nationalist supporters).|$|R
50|$|During a salvage {{operation}} {{in the mouth of}} Kızılırmak River (Hallys of the antiquity) the ship crew came together with <b>the</b> Turkish <b>nationalists,</b> who were fighting against the Allies as well as the Ottoman government. Inspired by <b>the</b> <b>nationalists,</b> <b>the</b> chief engineer Osman decided to join <b>the</b> <b>nationalists.</b> On 5 February 1921, Alemdar with a crew of 7, sailed to Karadeniz Ereğli to join <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> under <b>the</b> pretext of a salvage operation. They consigned the ship to <b>the</b> <b>nationalists.</b> <b>The</b> number of the crew was now 21 excluding Osman who fell ill in Karadeniz Ereğli. <b>The</b> <b>nationalists</b> decided to send the ship to a port in eastern Black Sea, where Allied control was less severe.|$|R
50|$|Since 1930, <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> {{had hired}} several German {{military}} advisers. They made <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> purchase many European weapons through a German company {{with which the}} German advisers cooperated. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalists</b> bought Italian CV-33 and CV-35 tankettes, German Panzer I Ausf. A light tanks, and British 12-ton tanks. The exact name of the British 12-ton tank is unknown.|$|R
5|$|Around 5,000 Germans and Austrians {{served with}} the International Brigades, {{some of whom were}} {{political}} refugees. There were few volunteers for <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> side (from any country), by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Britain and France {{recognised}} <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> {{government on}} 27 February 1939. Clement Attlee criticised {{the way it}} had been agreed, calling it 'a gross betrayal... {{two and a half years}} of hypocritical pretence of non-intervention'.|$|E
5|$|Defeated by the Labor nominee in 1910 {{following}} the Liberal government's defeat, Gould remained in parliament as a backbencher until 1917, {{when he retired}} after he was not re-endorsed by <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> Party.

50|$|The ICF raised over £30,000 for <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> in Spain. Medical {{supplies}} were sent, including ambulances. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalists</b> acknowledged <b>the</b> support {{given to them}} by the ICF.|$|R
50|$|The Communist {{strategy}} was much simpler {{than that of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> {{because there was no}} huge division within the Communist ranks, as there were among <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists.</b> <b>The</b> Communists had already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> withdrew, and after successfully establishing Communist bases in the rural regions, where the general populace had a much better life under them than they did in the Japanese-occupied areas. The people generally agreed that the Communists, rather than <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists,</b> deserved to represent China in accepting the invaders’ surrender.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, {{during the}} Spanish Civil War, {{there was an}} {{attempted}} landing of Republican forces in the shores of Porto Cristo that was repelled by <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists.</b> <b>The</b> major of Manacor, Antoni Amer Llodrà [...] "Garanya" [...] was assassinated by <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite {{his support}} for conscription, Gould was not {{endorsed}} by the new Nationalist Party to contest the 1917 election. Deeply offended, Gould nevertheless elected to retire rather than run as an independent and split <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> vote.|$|E
5|$|During the Spanish Civil War, Galland was {{appointed}} Staffelkapitän of a Condor Legion unit, 3.

50|$|After {{the defeat}} of Jinjiatun Campaign, <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> resumed their {{offensive}} with vengeance. In {{a short period of}} just two days, <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> were able to regroup and re-supply completely, and continued their push toward Siping. Chiang Kai-shek was determined to take Changchun after taking Siping, and Mao Zedong was equally determined to hold Siping to the end and prevent <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> from taking both Siping and Changchun. Both sides realized the upcoming campaign would be a difficult one and both sides placed one of their best field commanders in charge: Du Yuming for <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> and Lin Biao for the communists.|$|R

50|$|Chiang Kai-shek allowed <b>the</b> former <b>nationalists</b> {{to rejoin}} his army. <b>The</b> former <b>nationalists</b> were given <b>the</b> {{instruction}} {{to fight the}} communists until the arrival of Chiang’s troops. The city of Xinghua, located in central Jiangsu, was guarded by <b>the</b> <b>nationalists.</b> <b>The</b> Japanese puppet regime force rejoined <b>the</b> <b>nationalists,</b> totaling more than 7,000, including the 22nd Division and local security regiments. The communist New Fourth Army was determined to take the city, and amassed units from the communists' Central Jiangsu Military District.|$|R
5|$|The United Nations {{also put}} {{pressure}} on Portugal to move for decolonisation. Portugal threatened to withdraw from NATO, which {{put a stop to}} this support and pressure, and <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> groups in Mozambique were forced to turn to help from the Soviet bloc.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of PanzerI's was brought {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma in Gruppe Thoma (also referred to as Panzergruppe Drohne). Gruppe Thoma formed part of Gruppe Imker, the ground formations of the German Condor Legion, who fought on the side of Franco's Nationalists. Between July and October, a rapid Nationalist advance from Seville to Toledo placed them in position to take the Spanish capital, Madrid. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalist</b> advance and the fall of the town of Illescas to Nationalist armies on 18October 1936 caused the government of the Popular Front's Second Republic, including President Manuel Azaña, to flee to Barcelona and Valencia. In an attempt to stem <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> tide and gain crucial time for Madrid's defence, Soviet armour was deployed south of the city {{under the command of}} Colonel Krivoshein before the end of October. At this time, several T-26 tanks under the command of Captain Paul Arman were thrown into a Republican counterattack directed towards the town of Torrejon de Velasco in an attempt to cut off <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> advance north. This was the first recorded tank battle in the Spanish Civil War. Despite initial success, poor communication between the Soviet Republican armour and Spanish Republican infantry caused the isolation of Captain Arman's force and the subsequent destruction of a number of tanks. This battle also marked the first use of the molotov cocktail against tanks. Ritter von Thoma's PanzerIs fought for the Nationalists only days later on 30October, and immediately experienced problems. As <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> armour advanced, it was engaged by the Commune de Paris battalion, equipped with Soviet BA-10 armoured cars. The 45-millimeter gun in the BA-10 was more than sufficient to knock out the poorly armoured Panzer I at ranges below 500meters (550yd).|$|E

50|$|J.D. Nagarwala, DIG of the Special Reserve Police, {{which had}} been {{deployed}} along the territory, had been sympathetic with <b>the</b> <b>nationalists.</b> He had himself visited the area often and advised <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> on <b>the</b> next moves.|$|R
50|$|Enlisting {{the gangs}} angered the local populace, which already blamed <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> for losing <b>the</b> region to the Japanese invaders. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> lost popular {{support in the}} region, a problem {{exacerbated}} {{by the fact that}} the hired bandits had fought <b>the</b> <b>Nationalists</b> both prior to and during the war and had cooperated with the Japanese invaders. <b>The</b> <b>Nationalists</b> recruited forces from the former Japanese puppet regime, such as the Iron Stone Units (Tie Shi Bu Dui, 铁石部队), to be part of the local garrison, which only increased the hatred from the local populace, which had suffered under the Japanese puppet regime.|$|R
5000|$|A split then {{developed}} between the communist {{leaders of the}} uprising and <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> that had participated. <b>The</b> <b>nationalists</b> recognized that <b>the</b> uprising had been defeated and wanted to stop fighting, unlike the Partisans who were determined to continue the struggle. During <b>the</b> autumn <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> contacted <b>the</b> Italians and offered to assist them to fight the Partisans. Subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>nationalists,</b> including Đurišić who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegro, withdrew into the hinterland. The focus of <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> such as Đurišić was to avoid provoking the Italians but to protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between <b>the</b> communists and <b>nationalists,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> having closer ties with Serbia and a [...] "frontier" [...] mentality towards Muslims. The communists wanted {{to continue with the}} revolution by turning against their class enemies, whilst Ustaše manipulation of the Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from the areas annexed by Albania combined to make Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to continue with the uprising by turning on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. The uprising continued to a reduced extent until December 1941.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 610 {{aircraft}} were built, including prototypes, and they entered service in 1948 with the Soviet Air Forces. At least 372 {{were transferred to}} the People's Liberation Army Air Force in 1950 to defend Chinese cities against air raids by <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> Chinese and train the Chinese pilots in jet operations. The MiG-9 was quickly replaced by the MiG-15, and three are known to survive.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} legal process with two appeals that {{ultimately}} reached the Supreme Court in Nanjing and pitted public sentiment against {{the rule of}} law, she was finally given a state pardon by <b>the</b> <b>Nationalist</b> government on October 14, 1936. The assassination of Sun Chuanfang was ethically justified {{as an act of}} filial piety and turned into a political symbol of the legitimate vengeance against the Japanese invaders.|$|E
5|$|After independence, the All India Women's Conference {{continued}} to operate and in 1954 the Indian Communist Party formed its own women's wing {{known as the}} National Federation of Indian Women. However, feminist agendas and movements became less active right after India's 1947 independence, as <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> agendas on nation building took precedence over feminist issues.|$|E
40|$|The article {{contains}} a critical analysis of the non-capitalist path of Russia's development as voiced by <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> (narodniki). <b>The</b> analysis is focussed on: premises of selection by <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> of <b>the</b> non-capitalist path of development, economic growth factors in <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> concept, causalities of non-capitalist industrialization and the state's role in this process as well as <b>the</b> <b>nationalists</b> postulates regarding development of social production forms in Russian agriculture. The author tried to assess the feasibility of the development programme as postulated by <b>the</b> <b>nationalists.</b> An important element in this assessment is {{an answer to the}} question whether the non-capitalist path of develapment, if it was to have been implemented, would have allowed Russia from the late 19 th century to overcome its economic backwardness.

5|$|After the {{inception}} of Scouting in the early 1900s, some nations' programs have taken part in social movements such as <b>the</b> <b>nationalist</b> resistance movements in India. Although Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials {{as a way to}} strengthen their rule, the values they based Scouting on helped to challenge the legitimacy of British imperialism. Likewise, African Scouts used the Scout Law's principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to collectively claim full imperial citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, another {{proposal}} for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda.
