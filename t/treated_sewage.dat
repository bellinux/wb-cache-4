25|$|Primary {{treatment}} of sewage by quiescent settling allows separation of floating material and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains {{less than half of}} the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds. Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.|$|E

25|$|The separate, {{waterless}} {{collection and}} treatment of urine and feces in UDDTs prevents hormones, pharmaceutical residues and other micro-pollutants which are contained in human excreta from entering surface water or groundwater via <b>treated</b> <b>sewage.</b> This is because in conventional sewage treatment plants, these micro-pollutants are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, possibly reaching the groundwater. Detected concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater {{were in the order}} of 50ng/L in several locations in Germany.|$|E
25|$|These hormones {{can pass}} through water {{treatment}} plants and into rivers. Other forms of contraception, {{such as the}} contraceptive patch, use the same synthetic estrogen (EE2) that is found in COCPs, and can add to the hormonal concentration in the water when flushed down the toilet. This excretion is shown {{to play a role}} in causing endocrine disruption, which affects the sexual development and the reproduction, in wild fish populations in segments of streams contaminated by <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> effluents.|$|E

Through the <b>Treated</b> <b>Sewage</b> Effluent Initiative (TSEI) of the National Water Company, treated {{wastewater}} is sold {{to major}} water customers, such as industries or golf course operators, under long-term contracts {{of up to}} 25 years. This generates a revenue stream that recovers the costs of wastewater treatment under Build-Operate Transfer (BOT) projects financed by the private sector.

25|$|One {{concern about}} the use of {{hormonal}} contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, fish exposed to <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives. Because the antigens used in contraceptive vaccines are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.|$|E
25|$|The {{water supply}} in Abu Dhabi is {{managed by the}} Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company. , it {{supplied}} 560.2 MiGD (million imperial gallons per day) of water, while the water demand for 2005–06 {{was estimated to be}} 511 MiGD. The Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi (EAD) states that groundwater is the most significant source of water, as well as desalinated potable water, and <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> effluent. At 40.6 MiGD, the Umm Al Nar storage is the largest water source for Abu Dhabi, followed by the rivers Shuweihat and Taweelah. With falling groundwater level and rising population density, Abu Dhabi faces a severely acute water shortage.|$|E
25|$|It {{improves}} {{environment by}} reducing {{erosion of the}} banks and flooding of low-lying {{areas of the city}} by the walls constructed on the both banks. The new integrated sewage and storm-water system intercepts 38 former sewage and industrial effluent discharge points and route it to sewage treatment plants south of Vasna Barrage. Thus it reduced the water pollution in the river. The water level in the river is retained through Vasna Barrage and the losing water is replenished by the Narmada Canal. It enabled the groundwater recharge and the recreational facilities like boating in the river. There are also plans to replenish river by <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> water.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{clarifier}} effluent {{was discharged}} directly to eutrophic natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems {{can be built}} to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary <b>treated</b> <b>sewage.</b> Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time. Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined {{secondary}} treatment {{based on the}} performance observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage. Secondary <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30mg/l BOD and less than 30mg/l suspended solids. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and {{secondary treatment}} is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe stabilization ponds as providing treatment equivalent to secondary treatment removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from combined sewers, dilute industrial wastewater, or Infiltration/Inflow.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} air or oxygen {{being introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} screened, and primary <b>treated</b> <b>sewage</b> or industrial wastewater (wastewater) combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the organic content of the sewage. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of saprotrophic bacteria but also has an important protozoan flora component mainly composed of amoebae, Spirotrichs, Peritrichs including Vorticellids {{and a range of}} other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary Rotifers. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of mucilaginous filamentous bacteria can develop including Sphaerotilus natans which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.|$|E
