25|$|A {{consensus}} view is {{that taking}} rigorous high school courses is a plus. Guidance counselors report that admissions personnel take a student's course of study into serious consideration when evaluating applications. Admissions officers construct a high school profile and take into account such data as curriculum offerings, demographics, and grade distributions at the high school. One adviser suggested taking the hardest courses that there were, and that <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing,</b> in terms of evaluations, was to drop a hard course.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, {{crime rates}} in New York City were peaking after rising since 1966. Between 1966 and 1981, violent crime {{rates in the}} city had more than tripled from 325 to 1100 violent crimes per 100,000 people annually. By mid-decade, the city had a {{reported}} crime rate over 70% higher {{than the rest of}} the United States. In 1984, there were 2 homicides, 18 violent crimes, and 65 property thefts reported per 10,000 people. The subway became a symbol of the city's inability to control crime. In an opinion poll of New York City residents taken the month after the shootings, more than half of those surveyed said crime was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> about living in the city; about a quarter said they or a family member had been a victim of crime in the last year; and two-thirds said they would be willing to pay for private security for their building or block.|$|E
25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, but maybe <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> was that he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield. He chose to be on the battlefield to encourage his soldiers and officers, task which he accomplished with great success, turning many times the tides of the battle with his presence, personal example and words of encouragement.|$|E

With the {{acquiescence}} of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastassya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but completely innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted and angry, Nastassya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastassya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Yepanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastassya Filippovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.|$|E

[...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive.

Although Ferguson praised Arsenal's unbeaten run, he disputed whether this heralded a shift of power in English football: [...] " [...] are still the team every club wants to beat most of all – regardless of who is champions or unbeaten records.

500|$|Geoff Ryman wrote several award-winning {{novels and}} short stories that {{prominently}} feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of The Child Garden (1989), an outsider {{because of her}} resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into {{a relationship with a}} similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. Lust (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. Was (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally-challenged abused child, linked by their connection to The Wizard of Oz books and film. In a Locus magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: “In 1990, if you had asked me which was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then Was came out.... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay." ...|$|E

500|$|As well as {{his work}} {{alongside}} Webb, Mitchell has appeared on his own in several shows. He played technical expert Owen in the Radio 4 sitcom Think the Unthinkable in 2001. He played the surgeon Dr Toby Stephens in the BBC2 sitcom Doctors and Nurses. In 2005 he played Kate's hapless secretary Tim in the BBC's updating of The Taming of The Shrew in its ShakespeaRe-Told series. Mitchell appeared as various roles on the Channel 4 sketch programme Blunder. The show was not well received, with the British Sitcom Guide naming it as <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that Mitchell did in all of 2006 in their [...] "British Sitcom Awards" [...] of that year. He portrayed the recurring character of Dr. James Vine in the BBC sitcom Jam and Jerusalem.

500|$|The {{sources are}} {{inconsistent}} regarding {{the extent of}} the persecution in Constantius's domain, though all portray it as quite limited. Lactantius states that the destruction of church buildings was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that came to pass. Eusebius explicitly denies that any churches were destroyed in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Life of Constantine, but lists Gaul as an area suffering from the effects of the persecution in his Martyrs of Palestine. A group of bishops declared that [...] "Gaul was immune" [...] (immunis est Gallia) from the persecutions under Constantius. The death of Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was once dated to this era, but most now assign it to the reign of Septimius Severus. The second, third and fourth edicts seem not to have been enforced in the West at all. It is possible that Constantius's relatively tolerant policies were the result of Tetrarchic jealousies; the persecution, after all, had been the project of the Eastern emperors, not the Western ones. After Constantine succeeded his father in 306, he urged the recovery of Church property lost in the persecution, and legislated full freedom for all Christians in his domain.|$|E
500|$|In his mature works El Greco {{demonstrated}} a characteristic tendency to dramatize {{rather than to}} describe. The strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience. According to Pacheco, El Greco's perturbed, violent and at times seemingly careless-in-execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style. El Greco's preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions, which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles, led him to disregard {{the laws of nature}} and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents, particularly when they were destined for altarpieces. The anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in El Greco's mature works; for The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception El Greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another [...] "because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced, which is <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that can happen to a figure'". A significant innovation of El Greco's mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface. This interweaving would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso.|$|E
