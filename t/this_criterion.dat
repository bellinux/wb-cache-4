5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined above) {{is short}} {{compared to the}} physical size of the plasma. <b>This</b> <b>criterion</b> means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are more important than those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When <b>this</b> <b>criterion</b> is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet {{is that it has}} cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. <b>This</b> <b>criterion</b> excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date <b>this</b> <b>criterion</b> only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E
5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, quadrilateral, and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits <b>this</b> <b>criterion</b> {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E

5|$|Danielle Beaubrun was {{the only}} Saint Lucian swimmer to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics. She was the youngest member of the Saint Lucian delegation, at age 18. The 2008 Summer Olympics served as Beaubrun's Olympic debut. Beaubrun did not initially qualify for Olympic standards. However, because Saint Lucia had no naturally qualifying swimmers, the country was invited by FINA to send two swimmers to the Olympics, granted the swimmer had participated in the 2007 World Championships. Beaubrun met <b>this</b> <b>criterion,</b> and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. <b>This</b> <b>criterion</b> is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. <b>This</b> <b>criterion</b> is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

5|$|Since 1889, Wisden has {{published}} a list of Cricketers of the Year, typically selecting five cricketers that had the greatest impact during the previous English cricket season. However, in the 2000 edition, the editor Matthew Engel recognised that {{the best players in}} the world were typically no longer playing English domestic cricket, and opted to select the Cricketers of the Year based on their performances anywhere in the world. <b>This</b> <b>criterion</b> was applied for the following three years, but in 2004 it reverted to being based on the English season, and a Leading Cricketer in the World was also selected. The recipient of the award is selected by the editor of Wisden, with advice from cricket experts. An Australian, Ricky Ponting was chosen as the first winner of the award, for scoring 1,503 runs in international cricket, including eleven centuries during 2003.|$|E

25|$|Maximum Principal Stress Theory – by W.J.M Rankine(1850). Yield {{occurs when}} the largest {{principal}} stress exceeds the uniaxial tensile yield strength. Although <b>this</b> <b>criterion</b> allows for a quick and easy comparison with experimental data it is rarely suitable for design purposes.

25|$|The {{consistency}} criterion {{states that}} if dividing the electorate {{into two groups}} and running the same election separately with each group returns the same result for both groups, then the election over the whole electorate should return this result.

25|$|Thus, {{momentum}} is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, {{as long as}} the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy <b>this</b> <b>criterion.</b> This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or Galilean invariance.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>criterion</b> assigns a photon to an {{unambiguous}} category, but is {{only possible}} if wavelength is known. (Some measurement techniques do {{not distinguish between}} detected wavelengths.) However, these two definitions often coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the reasons}} listed above, some have {{proposed}} a possible change in the criteria for a quality start. One of the proposals include that for every two innings pitched, the starter is allowed to give up one earned run, {{and as long as}} he pitches five innings, a quality start would be recorded. <b>This</b> <b>criteria</b> would give Randy Johnson and Gaylord Perry listed in the above examples quality starts. <b>This</b> <b>criteria</b> would still allow a pitcher to have a 4.50 ERA and earn a quality start, but would better represent a quality start.|$|R

25|$|The {{criterion}} of embarrassment {{is also used}} to argue in favor of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent.
