40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze {{improvement}} of private pension system in Turkey in numerical quantities according to years and measure efficiency of system. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used as measurement method in the study. Inputs of DEA model are the number of employees and <b>total</b> assets. <b>Total</b> <b>quantity</b> of <b>total</b> premiums and funds is the output of model. The study is original since it differentiates pension companies as large-small scaled and domestic-foreign ones and enables more detailed analysis about efficiency. When analysis results are considered, it was observed that efficiency level in system had normal course with slight changes in the last 6 years. It was also concluded that large-scaled company group had lower efficiency than small-scaled company group and domestic companies had lower efficiency than foreign companies. The main reason of inefficiency was their inability to operate in optimal scale due to financial crisis.  </p...|$|R
40|$|World {{agriculture}} is at a turning point: economic growth, energy needs, {{and climate change}} redefine the equations of agricultural supply and demand and contribute to accelerate food prices. Biofuels have been particularly high on the global agenda largely due to rising concerns about national energy security, high energy prices, and global climate change, {{as well as the}} income expectations of farmers and other investors (von Braun and Pachauri 2006). The International Grain Council reports an overall growth in the use of cereals by 32 % in 2007 / 8 and an estimated 31 % in the coming year, and by 41 % and 32 % in the USA respectively (see table 1). The USA has a share of about 80 % in the <b>total</b> <b>quantity.</b> The <b>total</b> <b>quantity</b> used globally this year (95 Mill. Tons) is large, relative to <b>total</b> world trade of corn (100 Mill. Tons) and relative to <b>total</b> world corn production (777 Mill. Tons). The rapid expansion of ethanol and biodiesel has increased dependency on natural vegetation and crops grown specifically for energy. Biofuel production has also introduced new food-security risks and new challenges for the poor, particularly when resource constraints have lead to trade-offs between food and biofuel production and rising food prices. For the further development and use of biofuels, it is necessary to carefully assess the impact of different technologies, products (ethanol, bio-diesel, bio-gas), and feed stocks (e. g. sugar cane, corn, oilseeds, palm oil, agricultural waste and biomass).

40|$|Characterization of the {{nutrient}} composition of Dialium guineense (D. guineense) fruit was investigated. Fruit was sampled from the sub-Guinean forests of Senegal and analyzed for carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and essential micronutrients. HPLC analysis indicated high glucose and fructose content (90. 8 % of <b>total</b> soluble sugars). <b>Total</b> <b>quantities</b> of proteins (5. 3 %), lipids (3. 1 %) and essential vitamins (ascorbic acid, b-carotene and tocopherols in traces) {{were found to}} be relatively low by comparison. Nevertheless, fruits of D. guineense appeared to be potential sources for select micronutrients including copper, iron, manganese, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and essential amino acids. Specifically, compared to common fruits consumed in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, D. guineense appears to be a potential source of iron (4. 8 - 8. 4 mg/ 100 g), magnesium (0. 1 g/ 100 g), and copper (0. 7 mg/ 100 g) and would contribute toward meeting the recommended daily allowances of these micronutrients for use to combat malnutrition. Zinc content (0. 5 - 1. 6 mg/ 100 g) was comparatively lower. The high concentration of some mineral micronutrients thus suggests that D. guineense fruits may potentially be used as a food source or fortifying ingredient for locally processed foods to reduce deficiencies in selected, commonly deficient nutrients for at-risk populations.
