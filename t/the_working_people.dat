25|$|At {{the same}} time {{quite a number of}} the Russians of Latvia viewed the revival of the Latvian state system with mistrust. This is shown by the results of a public opinion poll in 1989. Only 49% of the non-Latvian {{population}} supported the idea of the independence of Latvia (the number of Latvians supporting the idea made up 93%). The International Front of <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> <b>People</b> of Latvia or Interfront, established in 1989, came out openly for remaining in the Soviet Union and preserving a socialist economy. Interfront aimed to win the sympathies of those Russians who were opposed to the idea of Latvia as a national state.|$|E

25|$|Yuri Sokolov, {{the head}} of the {{folklore}} section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>people,</b> and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat. Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens. He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.|$|E

500|$|In April, Dubček {{launched}} an [...] "Action Programme" [...] of liberalizations, which included increasing {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods {{and the possibility of}} a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that [...] "Socialism cannot mean only liberation of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>people</b> from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy." [...] It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of the ČSSR into two equal nations. The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations. It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo.|$|E

All three members were offered {{the chance to}} join to the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he [...] "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars." [...] Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was [...] "a gifted performer but {{a pain in the}} butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, very hard on <b>the</b> <b>working</b> <b>people.</b> He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person." [...] In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because he felt he was not being used enough. Martin Short said Shearer [...] "wanted to be creative and Dick [...] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset." ...|$|E
