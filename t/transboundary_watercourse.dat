40|$|Analysts {{around the}} world {{increasingly}} have {{their eyes on the}} Brahmaputra River, a <b>transboundary</b> <b>watercourse</b> with headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau of the Himalayan mountain range. The three riparian states sharing the Brahmaputra — China, India and Bangladesh — are the world’s first, second and seventh most populous countries. All three face severe problems of water scarcity and steeply rising demand for power generation. The possibility of serious resource conflict involving these demographic giants stems from plans, some already being implemented, to put the river’s thus-far relatively unexploited waters to greater use. The combination of burgeoning populations, rapid economic growth and intensified global competition for energy resources is putting increasing emphasis on hydropower. India, already the world’s sixth largest energy consumer, ranks seventh globally (2008) in current hydropower generation. Only about 20 per cent, however, of India’s hydropower potential has been developed thus far. With its untapped potential standing at 95 per cent, the importance of the Brahmaputra is clear...|$|E

As an exemple of how environmental changes may come to acquire an entity such as to be perceived as a threat when they combine with inequitable allocation of resources, we focus on shared water resources management. The framework at international level should be the two main instruments in this field, the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Watercourses</b> and International Lakes and the 1997 Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses. On the one hand, Central Asian States have shown only a weak commitment to these international regimes. On the contrary, they have prioritized the former URSS’s model of water and energy exchange. This model, as being unsustainable and inequitable, favors the extreme dichotomy between the two major competing uses of water in the region (irrigation and hydropower production). On the other hand, some sub-regional institutions served to clarify the articulation of water management structures. However, because of important issues on their internal organization, they {{have not been able to}} achieve their mission and their efforts seems to be directed to seek stability and the status quo in Central Asia...|$|R

The common feature of these procedures {{is that they can}} be initiated by individuals and non-governmental organizations. This novelty of international compliance procedures in environmental matters made them comparable with international procedures established by universal human rights treaties. All of them can be initiates by communications of individuals. The three mentioned procedures were established due to different reasons. By the pressure of environmental non-governmental organizations and to satisfy some economic concerns, the North American Free Trade Treaty was supplemented by the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation that was aimed at improvement of the application of national environmental law. Unequal levels of the application of national environmental laws in Canada, Mexico and the USA might have negative consequences to trade between them and to environmental protection in them. To prevent such development the Agreement was concluded and individuals and NGO-s are allowed to trigger international fact-finding procedure.

In spite of the fact that subject-matter and purposes of the London protocol are different, corresponding conciliatory procedure was inspired by the Aarhus procedure. All three procedures are intended, at last resort, to improve protection of the environment. The protection of an individual interest is not the first aim. Due to that, legal standing and rule on local remedies are not defined in the same way as in human rights proceedings.

40|$|The paper {{covers the}} {{analysis}} of water management problems in the cross-border reservoir basin of Bukówka, located at the Bóbr river, at 271 + 540 km of its course, below the Czech-Polish border, in Dolnośląskie Voivodeship. The problems of water management {{in the context of}} the reservoir’s functions have been analyzed; these are: flood control, the provision of water during low water level periods for the Water Treatment Plant in Marciszów, the provision of drinking water for the city of Wałbrzych as well as the provision of proper flow in the Bóbr river bed downstream from the reservoir. Due to its localization right below the border with the Czech Republic, the reservoir is exposed to a number of problems. The study has found that the main problems of water management in the basin area included unsatisfactory state of water and wastewater management in the basin, unsatisfactory state of the surface water quality in the basin area of the reservoir, poor condition of streams and drainage ditches, improper arrangement of arable lands and large downslopes and a lack of monitoring stations on tributaries of the reservoir. It has been found that the hydrochemical conditions in the Bukówka reservoir’s section are unfavorable for it. From the eutrophication point of view, the water flowing into the tank is characterized by a large content of nutrients, especially nitrates, phosphates and BOD 5. In order to counteract eutrophication it is necessary to lower the concentration of nutrients in the water flowing into the tank. One of the basic ways to do so is to restore the water and wastewater management in the reservoir’s basin. Studies in the Bukówka reservoir provide important information concerning the state of the purity of the water supplying the reservoir. In order to obtain accurate information on the state of purity, a monitoring of hydrological and water quality should be continued. The studies are a part of the strategy of protection of the quality of transboundary waters, proposed in the Convention on the Protection and Use of <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Watercourses</b> and International Lakes of 1992...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Most {{agricultural}} operations, such as soil tillage, manuring, grazing, and irrigation, pose {{a serious}} threat to water quality. Agriculture is a heavy water user and a serious water polluter (nutrients, pesticides, salts, pathogens, heavy metals, oxygen-depleting and radioactive substances, etc.). In addition, agriculture threatens water habitats. The UN “Convention for the Protection and Use of <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Watercourses</b> and International Lakes” ratified at Helsinki in 1992 obliges the signatory countries to further prevent, control and reduce water pollution from point and non-point sources. The implementation of the Convention is co-ordinated by the UN Economic Commission for Europe. In October 1999, this organisation commissioned a study aimed at assessing the status of implementation of regulatory and policy instruments to protect European waters from the consequences of agricultural practices. Material and methods The study (Znaor, 1999) involved nine European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Great Britain, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia), as well as several regional (international) programmes, such as EU, Baltic Sea, Danube River Basin and the Black Sea programmes. The information needed to analyse the existing national and international policies and their implementation was obtained through a survey using a specially developed questionnaire. The answers were provided by a number of high governmental officials from the ministries of agriculture, environment and/or water management of the reviewed countries and the respected international organisations. The survey was complemented with information collected through a literature study. Because of its potential to reduce the water pollution caused by agricultural practices, the policy instruments to promote organic farming have been given special attention in the study. Results and discussion The study showed that (i) although all surveyed countries have special legislation and policy instruments on protecting water from the consequences of agricultural practices, their implementation is unsatisfactory; (ii) thirteen out of fifteen EU countries failed in complying with the EU Nitrate Directive (in mid December 1999, only Denmark and Finland entirely complied with the Directive); (iii) only four out of nine countries surveyed have specific regulations and policies to support organic agriculture; (iv) the officials contacted assess organic farming to an agricultural method with the least pollution risk. The main obstacles for carrying out the above-mentioned convention are the weak institutional arrangements and the lack of appropriate policy instruments stimulating good agricultural practices. The convention is best implemented in the countries with both well-established national co-ordination between responsible ministries and operating subsidies for “water-friendly” farming. The subsidies that are provided {{within the framework of the}} agri-environmental programme in the EU, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovenia are great tools in enhancing conversion to organic agriculture. Conclusions The economic policy instruments were found to be most fundamental for change to organic farming. In order to encourage farmers (voluntarily) to participate in programs that minimise water pollution, the financial incentives for these programmes have to be as stimulating as other agricultural programmes designed to encourage high-input agriculture. The experience of several countries suggests that "green taxes" on fertilisers and pesticides higher than 100...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the growing water {{shortages}} world-wide and concerns over freshwater disputes arising from essentially a growing world population, an increase in per-capita consumption and the limited supplies of freshwater resources, this thesis looks at issues of governance of international rivers in terms of threats to them, gaps in their governance regimes and challenges associated with closing those gaps. International river basins globally are currently threatened with over-extraction, pollution, damming and infrastructural development {{as well as the}} impact of climate change. If left unaddressed, the pressure on the international river basins, as riparian States compete for its limited supplies, is only going to exacerbate any chances of freshwater disputes between them. The United Nations Convention on the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses offers a guidance framework to enable riparian States of international rivers to achieve ‘equitable utilization’ of water resources as well as management of the basin in order to avoid freshwater disputes. This thesis analyses the adequacy of the Convention to address the four main threats. The analysis is supplemented by the Berlin Rules, international cases and arbitral awards. The thesis has also undertaken a study of the European regional framework as an example of best regional practice, given that it not only has a similar Convention to the UN Watercourses Convention being the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe’s Convention on the Protection and Use of <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Watercourses</b> and International Lakes, but it also has other pieces of legislative and policy documents to guide the European Union States to achieve the paramount objective of the EU water policy, which is ‘good ecological status’ for all its water bodies by 2015. This is to ensure sustainable water supply for its current and future populations. In order to test the viability of the UN Watercourses Convention against individual basin’s legal regimes, the thesis has taken the Jordan, the Nile and the Indus River Basins as case studies as they are already considered to be ‘hot spots’ for freshwater disputes and the four main threats to them, which if not adequately addressed, will only aggravate the already existing tension. The analysis of the case studies’ legal regimes involve an examination of the extent of the specific threats in each river basin and {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each governance regime in order to ascertain where it is lacking. In order to enable an international legal framework that is apt to guide riparian States to deal with any of the four main threats to any international river basin, this thesis proposes recommendations for changes to the UN Convention based on other sources of international law and policy, the EU framework as well as the strengths of the governance regimes of the case studies. In order to minimize any chances of freshwater disputes and increase water security in the case studies, the thesis also makes recommendations for improvement to each legal governance regime based on international law and policy, the EU framework as well as the strengths of the governance regime of the other case studies. In doing so, this thesis provides a comprehensive overview of the current international law, policy, case law and arbitral awards relating to each major threat that has been identified. It also highlights the progress being made in addressing these threats in the European region through the practical application of the relevant treaties, directives and policy documents. Finally, it puts together the legal responses that are required to effectively address the four main threats in the Jordan, the Nile and the Indus River Basins...|$|R
