5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial,</b> and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial.</b> In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} who is competent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> {{is therefore}} also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, {{but not necessarily}} competent enough to represent herself at trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|Ostensibly, HIAG existed {{to provide}} aid to veterans, but it {{included}} many members who were convicted war criminals. These included Bittrich, Dietrich, Meyer and Gustav Lombard.

5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green was judged by court-appointed psychologists to be competent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> on the charges, which eliminated {{him as a}} candidate for involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third day of the trial, Wiens incurred a self-inflicted injury by banging his head against a table. He was diagnosed with haematomas and a suspected traumatic brain injury, but was judged fit <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> after a hospital-based medical examination. While continuing with noncompliant and destructive behaviour, Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court.|$|E
60|$|We reached Saragossa in safety, {{and there}} my first act was to {{surrender}} {{myself to the}} Grand Justiciary of Aragon <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> my <b>trial</b> {{for the murder of}} Escovedo with which I was charged.|$|R

5|$|Generals Pavle Strugar and Miodrag Jokić {{were sentenced}} by the ICTY to eight and seven years, respectively, for {{shelling}} Dubrovnik. A third indictee, Vladimir Kovačević, was declared mentally unfit <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial.</b> The Yugoslav Army's Chief of the General Staff, Momčilo Perišić, {{was charged with}} aiding and abetting war crimes but eventually acquitted on all charges.

The group included fifteen who were tried in absentia. In 2009, the process was split for Milan Tepavac and Ilija Vorkapić who were available to Croatian authorities, and once more a year later when Tepavac was judged not fit <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial.</b> Vorkapić was acquitted in 2012.|$|E

She was arraigned on February 23, 2012, and declined to enter a plea.|$|E

"I come hither with {{my companions}} bearing the warrant of the King to seize Edmund Acour, Count de Noyon, and convey him to London, there <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> his <b>trial</b> {{on a charge}} of high treason toward his liege lord, Edward of England. Yield you, Sir Edmund Acour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little {{more than}} a {{fortnight}} after that, Edith Crawford was duly committed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> her <b>trial</b> before the High Court of Justiciary. She had pleaded 'Not Guilty' at the pleading diet, and her defence was entrusted to Sir James Fenwick, {{one of the most}} eminent advocates at the Criminal Bar.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do mean to {{say that}} all the judges in England could not save her from having <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> her <b>trial,</b> and it is my belief that all the lawyers in the land cannot save her from conviction. I wonder whether she ever thinks now of those fields which she took away from me!" ...|$|R

Federal {{prosecutors}} filed five charges against him, including the attempted assassination {{of a member of}} Congress and the assassination of a federal judge. Loughner previously had been arrested (but not convicted) once on a minor drug charge and had been suspended by his college for disruptive behavior. Court filings include notes handwritten by Loughner indicating he planned to assassinate Giffords. Loughner did not cooperate with authorities, invoking his right to remain silent. He was held without bail and indicted on 49 counts. In January 2012, Loughner was found by a federal judge to be incompetent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> based on two medical evaluations, which diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Judged still incompetent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> on May 25, finally on August 7, Loughner had a hearing at which he was judged competent. He pleaded guilty to 19 counts, and in November 2012 was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September, a {{preliminary}} enquiry {{in a district}} court was held {{to determine whether there}} was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed.

The marijuana charge was dismissed after he was fined $500, and sentenced to six months probation with his two-day jail sentence being suspended.|$|E
5|$|The Pisones {{had been}} {{longtime}} {{supporters of the}} Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus's death and accusations indicted the new Princeps. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius. Whether the governor actually could connect the Princeps {{to the death of}} Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Tony King is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Chris Coghill. He was the partner of established character Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), and a father-figure to her four children.

Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} {{found that}} a principle of fundamental justice required an accusatorial and adversarial criminal justice system, founded on respect for the autonomy and dignity of human beings. Therefore, the same principle required that an accused person {{has the right to}} control his or her own defence (assuming the person is found fit <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> for <b>trial).</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! I try not {{to forget}} it," [...] rejoined Candeille lightly, [...] "but of a truth you must admit, Citizeness, that it would require the {{patience}} of a saint {{to put up with}} the insolence of a penniless baggage, who but lately has had <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> her <b>trial</b> in her own country for impurity of conduct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whew! I {{wonder what}} would have {{happened}} if a Gatling had been used when the West End riots were in full swing?" [...] said an Englishman. [...] "If a single rioter were killed in an English town by the police, the chances are that the policeman would have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> his <b>trial</b> for murder and the Ministry of the day would go out." ...|$|R
5|$|Wyatt altered {{his story}} later on, telling John H. Flood {{that he did}} not see Brocius's pistol {{on the ground in the}} dark until afterward. The pistol {{contained}} one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial,</b> possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial</b> for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E
5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>trial,</b> possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E

60|$|Convinced, at last, that James {{must have}} gone off to the lugger, Mr. Wilks {{returned}} to Sidmouth, a prey to great anxiety. Everything depended now on whether the lugger was captured. If so, James would have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> his <b>trial</b> for being concerned in the fight on the beach, and, as two of the revenue men had been killed, his sentence might be a heavy one.|$|R
60|$|Moses was right; {{there was}} in reality little danger in the climb, for the ledges which {{appeared}} to them like mere threads, and the footholds that were almost invisible, were in reality from a foot to three feet wide. The only danger lay in the hermit's head being unable <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> the <b>trial,</b> but, as Moses had remarked, there was no fear of that.|$|R
