5|$|In the 2003–04 season, he was {{originally}} Detroit's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek {{came out of}} retirement, and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph, since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace. However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. After {{a stint in the}} minors, he returned to the Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league. After defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games, the Red Wings were defeated {{in the second round of}} the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames.|$|E

50|$|Around {{this time}} heavy metal band Anodize, {{the most popular}} yet financially {{struggling}} indie band in Hong Kong decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quit.</b> All band members intended to retire from the music scene until they were approached by MC Yan and DJ Tommy, who were hoping to recruit Jimmy to play bass but were delighted when lead singer Wah and drummer/guitarist/keyboardist Davy decided to join too. A fourth Anodize member, Gary, joined the band as a part-time member. The addition of Anodize's former members added gravitas and musicianship to a group already loaded with talent. MC Yan decided to adopt the LMF name and the band was formally formed in 1998.|$|R

After being {{caught in the act}} with his secretary, Whitney decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quit.</b> Despite conflicting advice from her friends, Flora (Halima Abubakar) and Rina, she eventually accepted an apology from her husband for the utmost time. As a way of rejuvenating their marriage, Charles and Whitney decided to go on a vacation. At the hotel, they walked into one of Charles past lovers, which got Whitney irritated. Charles encounted his friend from University of Ibadan, Alex (Muna Obiekwe) who resolved the issue after some personal conversation with Whitney.|$|R

25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E
500|$|Because Never Say Never Again {{is not an}} Eon-produced film, it has {{not been}} {{included}} in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of MSN said that 1967's Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again [...] "exist outside the 'official' continuity, [...] are excluded from this list, just as they're absent from MGM's megabox. But take my word for it; they're both pretty awful". Of the more recent reviews, opinion on Never Say Never Again is still mixed: film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a 63% rating from 46 reviews. The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking Never Say Never Again 16th among all Bond films in 2008. Empire gives the film three of a possible five stars, observing that [...] "Connery was perhaps wise <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> the first time round". IGN gave Never Say Never Again a score of 5 out of 10, claiming that the film [...] "is more miss than hit". The review also thought that the film was [...] "marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond".|$|E

50|$|Newark Bears. Owned by the New Jersey Athletic Association (William Coughlin, president) and {{coached by}} Hal Hansen, {{featured}} a backfield consisting {{of people who}} attended college in Georgia (Georgia Tech and Oglethorpe College). The Bears scored a touchdown in its first game, a 7-7 tie with Chicago - and then did not score again in its remaining four games. Newark was the first AFL <b>to</b> fold, <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> after playing Rock Island to a scoreless tie in front of 400 fans on October 24, 1926. For its final game, Newark changed its nickname to the Demons.|$|R
50|$|Fierce {{fighting}} resumed {{and continued}} to the next day. After suffering five thousand casualties and realizing the rugged terrain had severely limited {{the effectiveness of the}} superior firepower, the nationalist commander refused to be drawn into a war of attrition anymore in a terrain favoring the enemy and decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a <b>quit.</b> Since turning back to reinforce Kaifeng was too late to do, the nationalists withdrew southward, abandoning the hope of annihilating the communist 10th Column. The communists, in the meantime, successfully achieving their original objective of preventing the nationalists from reinforce Kaifeng did not pursuit and ended the battle.|$|R
2500|$|Brilliant {{first came}} to life in 1982, as post-punk band Killing Joke was {{crumbling}} under internal conflicts. Unsatisfied with his bandmates' following of the occult lifestyle, Killing Joke's bass player Youth decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> and recorded an angry slandering song against his former bandmates. The song, [...] "That's What Good Friends Are For...", an obvious mock of Killing Joke's second album What's THIS for...!, was credited to [...] "Brilliant", which was a name of a Killing Joke B-side and a general 1980s buzzword.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{elected to}} push on and record 1997's Aftertaste as a three-piece. A {{first version of}} the album was {{withdrawn}} at last minute {{in the fall of}} 1996 when promotional activities had already begun. Eventually, release was delayed to March 1997 for a new audio mix, and the guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) was recruited for the supporting tour. Although the song [...] "Exactly What You Wanted" [...] became a moderate radio hit, the album spent only a few weeks on the Billboard 200 and has sold 135,000 copies as of April 2006. The Aftertaste Tour in 1997–98 would prove to be the band's last. Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits.</b> Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, [...] "9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, and we found it hard to look at each other anymore" ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, it was {{announced}} that HIM would be headlining the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in 2017, the band's first outdoor concert in Helsinki. In January 2017, HIM were also announced as the headliner of Miljoona Rock, held in Tuuri, Finland, on 18 July 2017. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour that same year. In the announcement, Valo stated: [...] "After quarter of a century [...] of love and metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you." [...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, everybody got along well together, but that spark was missing." [...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing about this is that there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E

In 2009, the band released a new record Punk Sounds which included b-sides, rarities and two new tracks. Official remasters of several of their albums have also been released. Limited edition vinyl pressings of Sweet Sixteen and Fun and Games were released in the summer of 2011. A complete collection of the band's demos (Prime Times: The Tascam Tapes) was released in early 2015.|$|R

In his preface, Daniel Defoe laments the conditions which bring destitute children to steal by necessity instead of becoming educated and well-principled men, and hopes his readers will find the story instructive.|$|R

60|$|And so {{he dragged}} {{himself to the}} Enquirer alley, sick in body and soul, but {{learning}} the long patience, to confront his eternal enemy, Cheese- Face, who was just as sick as he, and just a bit willing to quit {{if it were not}} for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful and necessary. One afternoon, after twenty minutes of desperate efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not permit kicking, striking below the belt, nor hitting when one was down, Cheese- Face, panting for breath and reeling, offered <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits.</b> And Martin, head on arms, thrilled at the picture he caught of himself, at that moment in the afternoon of long ago, when he reeled and panted and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat from his cut lips; when he tottered toward Cheese-Face, spitting out a mouthful of blood so that he could speak, crying out that he would never quit, though Cheese-Face could give in if he wanted to. And Cheese-Face did not give in, and the fight went on.|$|E

The last categorized bump was on the Bouquet Canyon Road, 22 mi from the finish line which was reached via mostly downhill roads in Santa Clarita.The temperatures were a lot more favorable to the riders on Stage 3. 41-year-old Jens Voigt (...) attacked right as the flag was dropped and a 23 men breakaway formed.

5000|$|While {{featuring}} 16 different characters, critics generally {{noted that}} there was not anything particularly [...] "likable" [...] about the characters. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40. Despite the critical response to Quantum Redshift being positive, garnering 76% at GameRankings, the game sold poorly. As a result, the second game, which was to include multi-play over Xbox Live was cancelled by Microsoft, and Curly Monsters closed shop shortly thereafter. As Curly Monsters said a statement before they closed down [...] "We were pursuing a number of avenues, and we'd developed some really cool new Xbox technology, but unfortunately {{we were not able to}} sign a deal prior to us running out of cash... we've not been able to pay our staff for the last month, and now <b>it's</b> time <b>to</b> (unfortunately) <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits...</b> I expect you'll see and hear from us in various guises as we spread out amongst other developers." ...|$|R

50|$|Through the season, Tony {{tries to}} define his troubling {{relationship}} with Neela, {{that is increasingly}} strained with Ray Barnett still longing for her. At Luka and Abby's wedding, Tony and Ray break out in a fight, drunk over the bar and over their growing hatred of one another. This led <b>to</b> Neela finally <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> between both of them. Gates later tries to reconcile things with Neela, just hoping to stay as friends. At an anti-war rally Neela attends, an explosion broke out sending the crowd into mass panic. Tony who was making {{his way through the}} crowd to Neela, desperately tries to get through the stampede to save her from being trampled. Gates also loudly castigated and slapped around the jerk who caused the stampede, causing an angry Dr. Moretti to banish Gates from the ER to the ICU. Later, the grandfather of a young girl who died from injuries sustained during the stampede strangled the jerk to death, having realized who he was as a result of Gates's actions. Though Gates initially was viewed as an ER reject, he bonded with a young prodigy who has a rare and incurable disease, and his strong work there and on other cases led Dr. Pratt to recommend to Dr. Moretti that he be allowed back to ER work. Gates then returned to the ER and began dating a friendly and free-spirited hospital chaplain named Julia, and was asked by Sarah's grandmother to have Sarah move back to Chicago with him because Sarah was starting to rebel against the farm atmosphere much the same as her late mother had. Sarah's grandmother later got angry with him when he wanted her husband to have surgery after a heart episode, though they eventually mended fences and Gates then said they should go with a different option presented by Dr. Morris. Gates and Julia broke up and she went to Nepal on a long spiritual retreat, and he and Samantha Taggart began a sexual relationship which started out with a kiss Samantha gave to Gates. After Gates called Sam for being distant towards him, they began a more mature dating relationship, although they also got caught having sex on a hospital security camera.|$|R
