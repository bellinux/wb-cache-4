5|$|From 1979 to 2009, 440youngsters {{have left}} <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> {{families}} {{to stay at}} the academy. About half of them were from Catalonia, and the rest came from other regions of the Kingdom of Spain and beyond, including 15 from Cameroon, 7 from Brazil, 5 from Senegal and 3 from Argentina. Of those 440, 40made it into Barcelona's first team.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to have been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis {{had set up}} the Lw√≥w Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews {{had to give up}} <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai {{was reported to}} be left in shock by the scale of damage. The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265people took advantage of this program.|$|E
5|$|Farther {{north in}} Rhode Island, 10,000people fled from the coast. Despite {{evacuation}} orders, {{nearly half of}} the residents in Narragansett, Rhode Island, refused to leave <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> as a result martial law was implemented to get people to leave. The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E

British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described {{the actions of the}} joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing. The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, Paine {{produced}} rainfall along {{much of the}} coastline, with maxima in inland Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Sonora {{where it}} moved ashore. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the remnants of Paine in the United States, there was an extended period of heavy rainfall, which caused at least 10deaths, forced thousands of people from <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> resulted in heavy flooding damage. The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{effects were}} mostly related to rainfall; up to 16inches (400mm) fell in some areas. When Fay flooded {{areas such as}} Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, 100families were {{evacuated}} from <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> 120people were stranded in hotels. It is reported that in that town, 10trees fell causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3meters (10ft) above flood stage. It is reported that 300families {{were not able to}} return to their homes for several weeks as a result of the flooding.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, {{at the age of}} 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Many Texas {{residents}} {{disagreed with}} the convention's perception. As the message spread across Texas, settlers left <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> assembled in Gonzales, where Colonel James Fannin was due to arrive with the remaining Texian Army troops. On February 27 one group of reinforcements impatiently set out on their own; as a result 32 additional Texians entered the Alamo. Research by historian Thomas Ricks Lindley indicates that an additional 50 or 60 men reinforced the Alamo on March 4.|$|E

5|$|Officials in Delaware and Maryland {{declared}} a state of emergency before the storm struck, and thousands of people from coastal communities evacuated to shelters. Schools closed in Delaware, and non-emergency workers were sent home. Along Long Island in New York, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> a state of emergency was declared for several counties. In Connecticut, about 20,000 people evacuated along the coast, and 7,300 evacuated from neighboring Rhode Island. Residents also evacuated portions of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its arrival, {{flooding}} {{across the}} central United States killed six people, forced {{thousands of people}} from <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> left at least $76million in damage (1986USD). Additional flooding from Paine exacerbated the situation; the flooding affected 52 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, {{which resulted in a}} total of $350 million in damage, half of which from agriculture. The remnants of Paine brought {{about the end of the}} extended period of rainfall, which overall had forced 55,000 people from their homes, including 1,200 in East Saint Louis, Illinois where a floodgate broke. It was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction of <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arlene {{combined with a}} non-tropical system caused heavy rainfall across New York, with some locations reporting 6 to 7inches (150 to 175mm) of precipitation in a 2-hour period. The rainfall collected into streams and rivers, with some officials calling it a 1 in 500year flood. The flash flooding caused at least one mudslide, and damaged several roads. The flooding forced at least 20 to evacuate from <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> numerous houses were damaged. Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, causing scattered power outages. Damage totaled to $6.5million (2005USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} Emily {{prompted}} hurricane warnings {{for much of}} the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware. A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000people during the busy Labor Day weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10million (1993USD). About 1,600residents on these islands rode out the storm in <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives, causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal. Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily's path, there were also evacuations from the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Fire Island in New York.|$|E
