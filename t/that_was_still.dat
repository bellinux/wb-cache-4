5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E

The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi-agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic Chinese-style dynasty.|$|E

Hassett was restrained while Bradman attacked, taking three fours from one Edrich over. Bradman was 31 and Hassett 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 63/1.

In Revelation, Wall adapted the themes for the recurring characters of Myst, and collaborated with Peter Gabriel, who provided a song to the game as well as voicework.|$|E

5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E

As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having {{caught up with the}} lost cruiser at this late stage. Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer , overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's triumph at Marengo secured his {{political}} authority and boosted his popularity back home, {{but it did}} not lead to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in Lunéville and reported that Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio. Britain now remained the only nation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> at war with France.|$|E

Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed and hung it on the wall of his home office.|$|E
5|$|The Cargador del Ancestro ("Ancestor Carrier") {{consists}} of four fragments of sculpture that had been reused in the facades of four different buildings during {{the latter part of}} the Late Preclassic. Monuments 215 and 217 were discovered in 2008 during excavations of Structure 7A, while Stela Fragments 53 and 61 had been unearthed in previous excavations. Archaeologists discovered that although Monuments 215 and 217 possessed different themes and were executed in differing styles, they in fact fitted together perfectly to form part of a single sculpture <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> incomplete. This prompted a revision of previously found sculpture fragments and resulted in the discovery of two further pieces, originally found in Structures 12 and 74.|$|E

5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the survivors of the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and the survivors of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|Burial 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for the burial of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the burial of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was laid out on the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October, the High Court {{ruled that}} the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory two {{senators}} each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July but the territorial senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant {{that it was possible}} for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33–31 margin, would be able to pass supply if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' perfect {{season and}} third {{championship}} victory came during a strong year for Cleveland sports teams. That April, the Cleveland Barons, the city's American Hockey League team, won the Calder Cup championship. The Cleveland Indians, the city's Major League Baseball club, set an all-time season attendance record {{and won the}} World Series. The Browns' success was also a major draw for fans: the team led professional football in attendance in 1948 {{with an average of}} 45,517 people per game, although <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> 10,000 lower than the year before. The distribution of talent and fortune among AAFC's teams was unbalanced, however, and while the Browns, the 49ers and the Dons were successes at the gate, teams including the Rockets and Colts languished financially. The NFL was also facing major financial trouble – nine of its ten teams lost money that year – and the two leagues' competition for talent led to talks about a merger. Discussions centered around how many AAFC teams the NFL would absorb; most owners favored four teams, but the talks broke down when powerful owners George Preston Marshall of the Washington Redskins and Tim Mara of the New York Giants intervened and suggested only Cleveland and San Francisco should be absorbed. The AAFC continued play in 1949, but was disbanded after that season. The Browns, 49ers and Colts were merged into the NFL starting in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such {{as for the}} Persona series, the team tried to stay faithful to the original text. This proved easier than for the Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes {{that would not be}} understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team were told that the game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl reading books. For his part, Meeker read King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements.|$|E
