25|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed {{in response to}} a Polish Air Force requirement of 1933 for a new army cooperation plane, a successor of the Lublin R-XIII. The RWD team of the DWL workshops (Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) initially proposed the RWD-12 project, based on the RWD-8 trainer. It was however considered as not as good as the R-XIII, and was not built. Another aircraft, the RWD-14 was designed by Stanislaw Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki instead.

25|$|Transient {{response}} is {{the reaction of}} a regulator when a (sudden) change of the load current (called the load transient) or input voltage (called the line transient) occurs. Some regulators will tend to oscillate or have a slow response time which in some cases might lead to undesired results. This value {{is different from the}} regulation parameters, as that is the stable situation definition. The transient response shows the behaviour of the regulator on a change. This data is usually provided in the <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> of a regulator and is also dependent on output capacitance.|$|E
500|$|One key {{aspect of}} the Gripen program that Saab have been keen to {{emphasize}} has been technology-transfer agreements and industrial partnerships with export customers. The Gripen is typically customized to customer requirements, enabling the routine inclusion of local suppliers in the manufacturing and support processes. A number of South African firms provide components and systems – including the communications suite and electronic warfare systems – for the Gripens operated by South African Air Force. Operators also {{have access to the}} Gripen's source code and <b>technical</b> <b>documentation,</b> allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated. [...] Some export customers intend to domestically assemble the Gripen; it has been proposed that Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer may produce Gripens for other export customers as well.|$|E

500|$|In early 1930, the Soviet buying committee, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Semyon Ginzburg, arrived in Great Britain to select tanks, tractors, and cars for use in the Red Army. The Vickers 6-Ton was among four models of tanks selected by Soviet representatives during their visit to Vickers-Armstrongs. Under the contract signed on 28 May 1930, the company delivered to the USSR 15 twin-turreted Vickers Mk.E (Type A, armed with two [...]303 calibre (7.71mm) water-cooled Vickers machine guns) tanks together with full <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> to enable series production of the tank in the USSR. The ability of the two turrets of the Type A to turn independently made it possible to fire to both the left and right at once, which was considered advantageous for breakthroughs of field entrenchments. Several Soviet engineers participated in assembly of the tanks at the Vickers Factory in 1930.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{retirement}} of the Boeing 707, No.33 Squadron relocated to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, on 1July 2008. It was presented with a Squadron Standard by Queensland Governor Penelope Wensley on 2June 2010, to commemorate [...] "25 years of faithful and outstanding service". Having been without aircraft for three years, the squadron began re-equipping with the first of five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports on 1June 2011. The KC-30 could carry one-and-a-half times as much fuel as the 707 and was configured with both probe-and-drogue and boom delivery systems. These aircraft had originally been scheduled to enter service late in 2008, and the RAAF had to lease tankers from the United States Air Force and Omega Air to meet its aerial refuelling needs while Airbus rectified problems with the boom system and completed essential <b>technical</b> <b>documentation.</b> In March 2012, one of the KC-30s set a record {{for the number of}} passengers carried on an RAAF aircraft, 220 cadets from the Australian Defence Force Academy.|$|E
500|$|Along with Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, {{also based}} at Williamtown, No.2 OCU {{was under the}} control of No.81 Wing from 1961 until the wing was disbanded in 1966. By late 1963, {{personnel}} were busy developing training material for the pending Sabre replacement, the Dassault Mirage III, a task that required them to translate the manufacturer's <b>technical</b> <b>documentation</b> from the original French. No.2 OCU received its first Mirages in February and March 1964. It commenced conversion courses on the type that October, and fighter combat instructor courses in August 1968. The RAAF eventually took delivery of 100 Mirage IIIO single-seat fighters and 16 Mirage IIID two-seat trainers; No.2 OCU operated both models. Squadron Leader John Newham, later to serve as CAS, held temporary command of the unit from July 1965 to April 1966. A Sabre-equipped aerobatic display team named the [...] "Marksmen" [...] was formed within No.2 OCU during 1966 and 1967. Between 1967 and 1984, six of the unit's Mirages suffered major accidents, resulting in three fatalities. Experience in the Vietnam War led the RAAF to begin training forward air controllers in 1968. The task initially fell to No.2 OCU before a specialised unit, No. 4 Forward Air Control Flight, was formed in 1970. [...] In October 1969, the OCU began operating the Macchi MB-326 jet for lead-in fighter training, as well as the Mirage. No.5 Operational Training Unit, based at Williamtown, took over responsibility for Macchi courses from April 1970 until its disbandment in July the following year; the Macchis were then transferred back to No.2 OCU.|$|E
