25|$|Nine {{months after}} the murder of Tkachenko, on 12 June 1982, Chikatilo {{travelled}} by bus to the Bagayevsky District of Rostov to purchase vegetables. Having to change buses {{in the village of}} Donskoi, he decided to continue his journey on foot. Walking away from the bus station, he encountered a 13-year-old girl, named Lyubov Biryuk, who was herself walking home from a shopping trip. Once the path both were <b>taking</b> <b>together</b> was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Chikatilo pounced upon Biryuk, dragged her into nearby undergrowth, tore off her dress, and killed her by stabbing and slashing her to death. When her body was found on 27 June, the medical examiner discovered evidence of 22 knife wounds inflicted to the head, neck, chest, and pelvic region. Further wounds found on the skull suggested the killer had attacked Biryuk from behind with the handle and blade of his knife. In addition, several striations were discovered upon Biryuk's eye sockets.|$|E

And as this book may, perhaps, be read sometimes by girls as well as boys, I will here, for their benefit, add the remark, that there is no possible way by which a lady can more effectually destroy any kind feeling which a gentleman may entertain for her than by forcing him to exhibit himself thus in an awkward and ridiculous light, by her unreasonable exactions on journeys, or rides, or walks, or excursions of any kind that they may be <b>taking</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

[...] That was a proposition I could present to her with candour, but before her absence of precipitation had permitted her much to consider it I had already followed it on. [...] "You'll just tell me, however, that since I do pull up and turn back with you we shall just have not separated. Well, then, so much the better--I see you're right. But I want," [...] I earnestly declared, [...] "not to lose an inch of the journey." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hold that}} nothing is so likely to be {{permanently}} prejudicial to the interest of hunting in the British Isles as a certain flavour of tip-top fashion which has gradually enveloped it. There is a pretence of grandeur about that and, alas, about other sports also, which is, to my thinking, destructive of all sport itself. Men will not shoot unless game is made to appear before them in clouds. They will not fish unless the rivers be exquisite. To row is nothing unless you can {{be known as a}} national hero. Cricket requires appendages which are troublesome and costly, and by which the minds of economical fathers are astounded. To play a game of hockey in accordance with the times you must have a specially trained pony and a gaudy dress. Racquets have given place to tennis because tennis is costly. In all these cases the fashion of the game is much more cherished than the game itself. But in nothing is this feeling so predominant as in hunting. For the management of a pack, as packs are managed now, a huntsman needs must be a great man himself, and three mounted subordinates are necessary, as at any rate for two of these servants a second horse is required. A hunt is nothing in the world unless it goes out four times a week at least. A run is nothing unless the pace be that of a steeplechase. Whether there be or be not a fox before the hounds is of little consequence to the great body of riders. A bold huntsman who can make a dash across country from one covert to another, and who can so train his hounds that they shall run as though game were before them, is supposed to have provided good sport. If a fox can be killed in covert afterwards so much the better for those who like to talk of their doings. Though the hounds brought no fox with them, it is of no matter. When a fox does run according to his nature he is reviled as a useless brute, because he will not go straight across country. But the worst of all is the attention given by men to things altogether outside the sport. Their coats and waistcoats, their boots and breeches, their little strings and pretty scarfs, their saddles and bridles, their dandy knick-knacks, and, above all, their flasks, are more to many men than aught else in the day's proceedings. I have known girls who have thought that their first appearance in the ball-room, when all was fresh, unstained, and perfect from the milliner's hand, was the one moment of rapture for the evening. I have sometimes felt the same of young sportsmen at a Leicestershire or Northamptonshire meet. It is not that they will not ride when the occasion comes. They are always ready enough to break their bones. There is no greater mistake than to suppose that dandyism is antagonistic to pluck. The fault is that men train themselves to care for nothing that is not as costly as unlimited expenditure can make it. Thus it comes about that the real love of sport is crushed under a desire for fashion. A man will be almost ashamed to confess that he hunts in Essex or Sussex, because the proper thing is {{to go down to the}} Shires. Grass, no doubt, is better than ploughed land to ride upon; but, <b>taking</b> <b>together</b> the virtues and vices of all hunting counties, I doubt whether better sport is not to be found in what I will venture to call the haunts of the clodpoles, than among the palmy pastures of the well-breeched beauties of Leicestershire.|$|E

5000|$|Trust {{management}} (management by trust, management through trust) can be conceptualized in two ways. First, as {{a process}} by which individual A becomes trustworthy for other individuals. This trust is significant criterion of success and survival because it makes individuals to collaborate with individual A.

Second, {{as a process}} of assessing the reliability of other individuals, which is as much important as process of building A’s own reliability. <b>Taking</b> <b>together</b> these two aspects we can formulate the following definition of trust management (Grudzewski, Hejduk, Sankowska, Wańtuchowicz, 2008): ...|$|E

50|$|The STIM2 {{function}} {{has been}} controversial. Initital {{studies found that}} siRNA knockdown of STIM1, but not STIM2, strongly reduced SOCE in mammalian cells. Liou et al. reported a slight reduction in SOCE also by knockdown of STIM2 in HeLa cells. Soboloff et al. suggested that STIM2 inhibits SOCE when expressed alone, but coexpressed with Orai1 causes substantial constitutive SOCE. In contrast, Brandman et al. suggested that STIM2 could act as a regulator that stabilizes basal cytosolic and ER Ca2+ levels. Parvez et al., using in vitro transient coexpression of human STIM2 and different SOC channels in HEK293 cells, reported that STIM2 mediates SOCE via two store-dependent and store independent modes. <b>Taking</b> <b>together,</b> these results indicate a complex interaction finely regulated by the STIM1: STIM2: Orai cellular ratio and their endogenous levels.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{publication}} of “Our Common Future” in 1987 one has started to include in sustainability besides a sustainable use of the physical surroundings also elements that conflict with this, such as the growth of production as measured in the national income and some social measures. By <b>taking</b> <b>together</b> environmental conservation and herewith conflicting goals in {{one and the same}} sustainability indicator the development {{of the state of the}} environment is being obscured. Moreover, there are examples of measures that worked socially advantageous in the short term but disastrous in the long term because of impairment of vital environmental functions. Arguments in support of this and some historical examples are given in {{the publication}}s of Hueting and Reijnders (2004) and De Boer and Hueting for the OECD (2004) mentioned below.|$|E

5000|$|On 3 September 1981 Chikatilo {{encountered}} a 17-year-old boarding school student, named Larisa Tkachenko, {{standing at a}} bus stop as he exited a public library in Rostov city centre. According to his subsequent confession, Chikatilo lured Tkachenko to a forest near the Don River with the pretext of drinking vodka and [...] "relaxing". When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing off her clothes and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions. When Chikatilo failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside her mouth to stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death. As he had no knife, Chikatilo mutilated the body with his teeth and a stick; he also tore one nipple from Tkachenko's body with his teeth, before loosely covering her body with leaves, branches, and torn pages of newspaper.
