25|$|The {{last few}} years of Graf's career were beset by injuries, {{particularly}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> back. She lost the World No. 1 ranking to Martina Hingis and failed to win a Grand Slam title {{for the first time}} in ten years in 1997. That year Graf lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open in straight sets to Amanda Coetzer.|$|E
25|$|This national-patriotic {{movement}} {{charges that}} for centuries the West has plundered Russia of her natural resources, {{trying to bring}} Russia <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> undermining Russia's messianic and self-sacrificing mission to enlighten and save mankind, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union as evidence. In their view, the United States want to break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials. The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their belief.|$|E
25|$|Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and the 1999 team {{started a}} {{revolution}} towards women's team sports in America. Arguably their most influential and memorable victory {{came in the}} 1999 World Cup when they defeated China 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extended time. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a women's sporting event {{and one of the}} largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the Rose Bowl to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4–4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously dropped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> whipped off her shirt, celebrating in her sports bra, which later made the cover of Sports Illustrated and the front pages of newspapers around the country and world. This win influenced girls to want to play soccer on a team.|$|E
60|$|But the lady's whole frame seemed shaken. She sat down, bent <b>her</b> head <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> wept aloud. Nothing could console her {{till the}} inward storm had had its way. At last the agony {{subsided}} of itself.|$|R

500|$|Mary Jane was {{voiced by}} Vanessa Marshall. Marshall has voice acted on several {{animated}} series and video games, {{as well as}} starring in commercials and other on-screen roles and performing stand-up comedy. Marshall was filming a Honda commercial when her agent, Cathey Lizzio, called her to confirm that she had landed the role as Mary Jane, simply saying, [...] "Hello, is this Mary Jane?" [...] Overjoyed, Marshall dropped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> began hyperventilating, which worried the producers of the commercial. Marshall's mother had voiced Spider-Woman in the original 1980s Spider-Man animated series, though Marshall's interest in Spider-Man had dated back to reading the comic books in her youth. On her character, Marshall noted that she is [...] "incredibly complex:" ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "1+1" [...] live on American Idol on May 25, 2011. Wearing {{a purple}} gown, she sang the song surrounded by smoke and red lighting, declaring, [...] "This {{is my favorite}} song". Towards {{the end of the}} performance, she fell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> shook the hands of audience members. The performance earned her a standing ovation from the judges and members of the crowd. A writer from The Huffington Post called it [...] "an epic, emotionally-charged performance" [...] and praised the fact that Beyoncé [...] "channel every particle of the room's energy into her lung-bursting calls and cries." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard magazine noted, [...] "The sheer force of the ballad literally brought [...] to her knees during the performance." [...] Shortly after Beyoncé's performance on American Idol, a video that surfaced online received considerable coverage from music critics. It became an instant viral video as soon as it hit the web. The clip was filmed using a camera phone and it shows Beyoncé rehearsing [...] "1+1" [...] backstage at American Idol with no microphone and simple keyboard accompaniment. The video was filmed by Beyoncé'ss husband, Jay-Z. In an introduction to the video on his Life + Times website he wrote: [...] "Sometimes you need perspective. You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time." [...] In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number eight on their list of Beyoncé's ten best videos, writing that she sounds [...] "perfect".

2500|$|Dubbed [...] "the miracle girl" [...] by {{the world}} press ("la miraculée" [...] in French), Bakari was flown back to France on a private Falcon-900 {{government}} jet, escorted by French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet. Arriving at Le Bourget airport, she was reunited with her father, Kassim Bakari, {{and the rest of}} her family, and transported to a Paris hospital for a fractured pelvis and collarbone, burns <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> some facial injuries.|$|E

Batcheller continued to serve on various diplomatic and commercial posts in Europe. In 1895, he presided over the 5th conference of the Universal Postal Union.|$|R
60|$|Her {{influence}} upon us was distinctly literary. She gloried in New England traditions, {{and taught}} us to love the poems of Whittier and Longfellow. It was she who called us <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> told us sadly yet benignly {{of the death of}} Lincoln, expressing only pity for the misguided assassin. She was a constant advocate of charity, piety, and learning. Always poor, and for many years a cripple, I never heard her complain, and no one, I think, ever saw her face clouded with a frown.|$|R

50|$|The 2013-14 {{season was}} less successful. She reached the quarter-finals in Saint-Petersbourg and Marseille, but ceded {{in the first}} round of the European Championships against France's Ysaora Thibus. In the team event, Russia cruised to the final where they met Italy, which had stayed unvanquished all season. Russia {{unexpectedly}} took an early lead, but Italy managed to come back at the end, dooming Russia to a silver medal. In the World Championships at home in Kazan, she sustained a bruise <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was stopped in the second round by Korea's Oh Ha-na. In the team event, Russia met Italy again in the final and were defeated again.|$|R

60|$|Santos, looking immensely {{relieved}} and grateful, though {{a little surprised}} at my confident tone, was hurrying out when I pointed to the saddle-bags. He nodded, grinned, and, snatching them up, left the room. Poor old Ramona threw herself on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knees,</b> sobbing <b>and</b> pouring out farewell blessings on her mistress, kissing her hands and hair with sorrowful devotion.|$|R
60|$|She {{bowed her}} head {{and sat down on}} a big scarlet cushion, drawing her little boy, who was asleep in a corner, on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> tell the story of her life. As her brother listened, he would fain have left the house and hidden himself in the forest, but it was his duty to wave the fan of peacock's {{feathers}} over the king's head to keep off the flies, and he knew he would be seized by the royal guards if he tried to desert his post. He must stay where he was, there was no help for it, and luckily for him the king was too much interested in the tale to notice that the fan had ceased moving, and that flies were dancing right {{on the top of his}} thick curly hair.|$|R

6000|$|A {{profound}} stillness succeeded {{this burst}} of nature, {{and then the}} young man took his leave {{of his mother and}} the girls. Mrs. Willoughby kissed her child.

Beulah, all heart and truth as she was, wept freely on her brother's neck; but Maud, though pale and trembling, received his kiss without returning it; though she could not help saying with a meaning that the young man had in his mind all that day, ay, and for many succeeding days--"be careful of yourself, and run into no unnecessary dangers; God bless you, dear, dear Bob." ...|$|R
