50|$|On March 8, 1918, F.E. Adkins, {{merchant}} at Harts, {{along with}} Coon Tomblin, met Walter Farris at the Ferrellsburg train stop near the Stowers store. At the time, Farris, {{a resident of}} Piney Fork, was relocating to the Logan County coalfields. An altercation arose between Farris and Adkins. Adkins reportedly urinated in Farris' lard bucket and also shot into some of his furniture. Later that evening, as Adkins returned through Ferrellsburg to Harts, Farris shot him from the (?) yard. Adkins fell face-first onto a <b>tie</b> <b>pile,</b> breaking his nose. His body lay there throughout the night until a local {{justice of the peace}} could convene a coroner's jury. Tomblin was also shot in the incident, but did not immediately die. Walter Farris was pardoned by the governor, John J. Cornwell, in April, 1919, due to extenuating circumstances of the case.|$|E

In this three-quarters profile portrait, {{a middle-aged}} Mr. Arnoll {{can be seen}} sitting in an office, at a desk, wearing a dark suit, white shirt, and {{patterned}} <b>tie.</b> <b>Piles</b> of paperwork cover the desk, {{as well as a}} pair of spectacles, to the left of his right hand, which holds a light colored pen or pencil. A wedding band appears on the ring finger of his left hand...|$|R
50|$|The Governor Ames was wrecked in a gale on December 13, 1909, {{four miles}} off Cape Hatteras on the North Carolina coast, having sailed on December 9 from Brunswick, Georgia bound for New York with a cargo of {{railroad}} <b>ties</b> <b>piled</b> high on her deck. The schooner was driven onto Wimble Shoals and broke up within two hours. Thirteen of the fourteen aboard perished, including the master, Captain King, and his wife. The sole survivor was one Joseph Speering of New York.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} of Poe's {{contrivance}} of the hook and chain, and how the heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the <b>ties</b> were <b>piled</b> and fired and the rails twisted out of shape. The President listened to every word with intense interest.|$|R
60|$|The ride {{appeared}} {{slow and}} long, dragged out by innumerable stops. All {{along the line}} laborers awaited the train to unload supplies. At {{the end of the}} line there was a congestion Neale had not observed before in all the work. Freight-cars, loaded with stone and iron beams and girders for bridge-work, <b>piles</b> of <b>ties</b> and <b>piles</b> of rails, and gangs of idle men attested to the delay caused by an obstacle to progress. The sight aggressively stimulated Neale. He felt very curious to learn the cause of the setback, and his old scorn of difficulties flashed up.|$|R

5000|$|Historian Paul D. Buell {{argues that}} the word [...] "baklava" [...] may come from the Mongolian root [...] 'to <b>tie,</b> wrap up, <b>pile</b> up' {{composed}} with the Turkic verbal ending -v; baγla- itself in Mongolian is a Turkic loanword. Armenian linguist Sevan Nişanyan considers its oldest known forms (pre-1500) to be baklağı and baklağu, and labels it as being of Proto-Turkic origin. Another form of the word is also recorded in Persian, [...] (...) [...] Though the suffix -vā might suggest a Persian origin, the baqla- part {{does not appear to}} be Persian and remains of unknown origin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} tracks {{consisted of}} wooden rails on transverse wooden sleepers, which helped maintain the spacing of the rails. Various developments followed, with cast iron plates laid {{on top of}} the wooden rails and later wrought iron plates or wrought iron angle plates (angle iron as L-shaped plate rails). Rails were also individually fixed to rows of stone blocks, without any cross ties to maintain correct separation. This system also led to problems, as the blocks could individually move. The first version of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's [...] broad gauge system used rails laid on longitudinal sleepers whose rail gauge and elevation were pinned down by being <b>tied</b> to <b>piles</b> (conceptually akin to a pile bridge), but this arrangement was expensive and Brunel soon replaced it with what became the classic broad gauge track, in which the piles were forgone and transoms, similar to sleepers, maintained the rail gauge. Today, most rail track uses the standard system of rail and sleepers; ladder track is used in a few applications.|$|R
60|$|One Sunday morning old Captain Spink paid me a visit. The {{conversation}} was confidential. He {{had just been}} fishing in his skiff in the old Alameda ferry slip. As the tide went down, he had noticed a rope <b>tied</b> to a <b>pile</b> under water and leading downward. In vain {{he had tried to}} heave up what was fast on the other end. Farther along, to another pile, was a similar rope, leading downward and unheavable. Without doubt, it was the missing salmon boat. If we restored it to its rightful owner there was fifty dollars in it for us. But I had queer ethical notions about honour amongst thieves, and declined {{to have anything to do}} with the affair.|$|R
60|$|The {{voyage of}} the Calipha came to its usual {{termination}} about ten o'clock {{on the following}} morning, when she passed Boston lights and steamed slowly down the smooth waters of the harbour. The seven passengers were all upon deck in wonderfully transformed guise. Already the steamer chairs were being <b>tied</b> up and <b>piled</b> away; the stewards, officiously anxious to render some last service, were hovering around. Mrs. Watson, in a plain tailor gown and quiet felt hat, was sitting heavily veiled apart and alone. There were no signs of either Mr. Watson or Mr. Sabin. The captain was on the bridge talking to the pilot. Scarcely {{a hundred yards away}} lay the Kaiser Wilhelm, white and stately, with her brass work shining like gold in the sunlight, and her decks as white as snow.|$|R
50|$|The Balge's {{banks were}} {{subsequently}} reinforced in several stages. When excavations {{were carried out}} in 1970 at the Bankhaus Neelmeyer (close to where the Böttcherstrasse joins the Marktplatz), remains of the harbour sides, fortified with masonry, together with dolphins, were found. The dolphins were made from oak <b>piles</b> <b>tied</b> together with iron rings in groups of three. Similar discoveries had already been made in 1909 {{at the corner of}} Marktplatz and Langenstrasse and in 1862 near the Schütting and Wachtstrasse. Evidence of an even older structure was found: a bank reinforcement made from piles and wickerwork, presumably built before the 10th century. The other structures consisting of stone and brick are assumed to have been made in medieval or late medieval times (between 11th and 15th centuries). The market place probably stems for its role as a harbour-side market, with ships mooring along its south bank.|$|R
2500|$|The {{owners of}} George M. Brown were {{themselves}} sued in April 1928, by E.J. “Bud” Rowland, {{who claimed that}} the tug {{was supposed to have}} towed two log rafts from Siletz Bay to the Multnomah County Lumber & Box Company, at Portland, with delivery to have been made between early September and October 10, 1927. [...] According to Bud Rowland, the first raft of 320,000 board feet of timber, was ready to be taken under tow on October 14, 1927, and was taken as far as Tillamook Bay, where the tug, it was claimed, negligently tried to cross the bar in a heavy sea, causing the raft to break free, and as a result became a total loss. [...] The second log raft, comprising 258,247 board feet of lumber, was <b>tied</b> to a <b>piling</b> in Siletz Bay in later October 1927, but on February 6, 1928, the raft came loose and went ashore. [...] Rowland claimed that as a result, it had suffered damages of $11,121. [...] Ultimately, following a trial, the owners of George M Brown were found not liable.|$|R
5000|$|Coeur dAlene, sternwheeler, {{built in}} 1883 by Capt. Z.J. Hatch (b.1846), of Portland Oregon, [...] {{dismantled}} 1892. [...] One hundred twenty (120) {{feet long and}} 14 feet beam. [...] (Alternative dimensions: 140 long, 26 foot beam, 6.4 foot depth of hold.) Coeur dAlene made its first trip on April 2, 1884, up the lake from Coeur dAlene city to Kingston, which was past the Old Mission on the St. Joe River. [...] Coeur d’Alene was intended to transport ore from the mines of the Coeur d’Alene area. [...] Proved {{to be a very}} lucrative boat, with net earnings sometimes $2,000 per trip. [...] Coeur d’Alene cost $24,800 to build, and with freight rates at $40 per ton, the steamer was able to pay for itself after 90 days of operations. [...] Sold in 1884 to D.C. Corbin interests, sold again in 1888 to the Northern Pacific Railroad. [...] Abandoned in 1890, with machinery and superstructure being used for Georgie Oakes. [...] Old hull <b>tied</b> to a <b>piling</b> near the Johnson Boat House at Coeur d’Alene city, where it sunk.|$|R

50|$|The most {{successful}} armoured train {{was a single}} car built to defend the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front; and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. Baldwin Locomotive Works modified a baggage car in late April, 1861. A 24-pounder howitzer was placed on a swivel mount {{at the opposite end}} of the car from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the car were sheathed with 2.5 inch cm oak planks covered with 0.5 inch cm boiler plate. The end of the car around the howitzer was fitted with hinged 2 ft panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with grapeshot or canister shot. The remainder of the car contained fifty ports for riflemen. The car was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such cars of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August, 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad locomotive pushing an armoured train; and then <b>piled</b> <b>ties</b> around the armoured car and set them afire.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} in urban population and technological progress, people’s demands for a comfortable life have also increased. Shortage of space for parking, public amenities and housing utilities has made necessary to use underground spaces. Deep excavations in urban areas require special measures due {{to the presence of}} structures, underground utilities and other engineering constructions existing in the vicinity. Deep excavations are supported by systems like conventional retaining walls, sheet pile walls, braced walls, diaphragm walls and pile walls etc. The design of support systems for deep excavation requires careful analysis, design and monitoring of performance. As such, the performance of support systems for deep excavation requires careful consideration of soil-structure interaction. In this study, 2 D Finite element model is developed using PLAXIS to represent the performance of anchored sheet pile wall, stress analysis and deformation characteristics of ground and bending moment distributions in sheet pile wall at all vulnerable locations are identified. The analysis is carried out considering non-linear behavior of soil using Mohr-coulomb failure criteria. The input data include typical building loads, prestressing forces, soil parameters and thickness of sheet pile and hence one of the main focuses is to identify their effects on the performance of <b>tie</b> back sheet <b>pile</b> walls. Results of the study reveal that sheet pile wall method is viable to limit ground movements due to the excavation. Besides, the parametric study shows that considerable reduction in wall deformations and bending moments can be achieved and safe excavation to greater depths is possible with th...|$|R
