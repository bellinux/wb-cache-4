6000|$|Well, I {{was many}} {{a year before}} I found out that, and I dare say I never should have found it out for myself. A gentleman named Trimmer, who, alas! is now dead, was, I believe, the first to find it out. He knew that {{along the coast of}} Labrador, and other cold parts of North America, and on the shores, too, of the great river St. Lawrence, the {{stranded}} icebergs, and the ice-foot, as it is called, which is continually forming along the freezing shores, grub and plough every tide into the mud and sand, and shove up before them, like a ploughshare, heaps of dirt; and that, too, the ice itself is full of dirt, of sand and stones, which it may have brought from hundreds of miles away; and that, as this ploughshare of dirty ice grubs onward, the nose of the plough is continually being broken off, and left underneath the mud; and that, when summer comes, and the ice melts, the mud falls back into the place where the ice had been, and covers up the gravel which was in the ice. So, what between the grubbing of the ice-plough into the mud, and the dirt which it leaves behind when it melts, the stones, and sand, and mud upon the shore are jumbled up into curious curved and twisted layers, exactly like those which Mr. <b>Trimmer</b> <b>saw</b> in certain gravel-pits. And when I first read about that, I said, [...] "And exactly like what I have been seeing in every gravel-pit round here, and trying to guess how they could have been made by currents of water, and yet never could make any guess which would do." [...] But after that it was all explained to me; and I said, [...] "Honour to the man who has let Madam How teach him what she had been trying to teach me for fifteen years, while I was too stupid to learn it. Now I am certain, as certain as I can be of any earthly thing, that the whole of these Windsor Forest Flats were ages ago ploughed and harrowed over and over again, by ice-floes and icebergs drifting and stranding in a shallow sea." ...|$|E

40|$|SAW {{devices are}} {{routinely}} frequency trimmed at the wafer level {{prior to the}} dicing process so to improve yield at the assembly level. The trimming {{can be achieved by}} using wet etching, reactive ion etching, ion beam milling, and other methods. It is also possible to trim the frequency of patterned SAW wafer by depositing dielectric thin films on the wafer but this method is usually done for the purpose of finger shorting protection from metallic particles. Reactive ion etching can be used to <b>trim</b> assembled <b>SAW</b> devices prior to encapsulation. This is seldom employed since it is considered costly, inefficient, and difficult to perform in-situ. In this paper we propose <b>trimming</b> assembled <b>SAW</b> resonator (SAWR) by using the conventional crystal resonator fine-tuning process with gold thin film addition. Nowadays, the fine-tuning process is a necessary step in crystal resonator production. We show that this is a simple and well-controlled method to <b>trim</b> assembled <b>SAW</b> resonator also. This method provides a wide trimming range and the gold film is thin enough not to short out the SAW transducers so that the SAWR’s integrity can be maintained...|$|R

We prove that a polygon has this property precisely if it does not have two adjacent reflex vertices. As a consequence, every polygon can be modified slightly to make it cuttable by a circular saw. We give a linear-time algorithm to cut out such a polygon using a number of cuts and total length of cuts that are at most 2. 5 times the optimal. We also study polygons cuttable by an arbitrarily large circular saw, which is equivalent to a ray, and give two linear-time recognition algorithms...|$|R

Logs are cut to length through a Log Merchandising machine. The numerical data generated by the dimensional measuring system is proposed as feedstock for an ambitious computer program {{that is designed to}} imitate the computerised, electrical and mechanical processes of sawmill plant. Supposition being that a well fashioned predictive software can provide an element of competitive advantage through the potential to aid production planning. The program takes any user specified generic Tuan sawmill alpha-numeric cut pattern code and interrogates into dimensional pattern cross-sections. The software has been fashioned to select the sideboard width option that maximizes sawn volume yield recovery. The board trimming process synthesises laser vision sensing and computer processing to determine the mechanical saw docking requirements; it is the vital final quality control mechanism at the sawmill. Sensed wane dimensions of the timber are paired up against programmed wane rules in the solutions computer to decide which <b>trim</b> <b>saws</b> will actuate and dock to chip.

50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand <b>trimmed</b> using <b>saws</b> or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{numerical}} coupled Finite Element Method/Boundary Integral Equations (FEM/BIE) technique {{which allows the}} 2 D physical simulation of Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) transducers infinitely periodic in one direction. This new technique could be generalized to various periodic acoustic 2 D simulations. This new method uses an original Variational Formulation (VF) which formally includes harmonic periodic boundary conditions, and, efficient boundary integral formulations allowing {{to account for the}} semi-infinite dielectric and piezoelectric spaces. In the case of the piezoelectric semi-space, the Green’s functions are efficiently computed using Fahmy–Adler’s method [8]. Only periodic boundary conditions are needed, which greatly simplifies the code implementation. This numerical model has been developed to analyze an Inter-Digital Transducer (IDT) with complex electrode shape (unburied, buried or raised electrodes). The use of buried electrodes in SAW transducer designs on quartz has important advantages when compared with unburied metal electrodes on the surface. One important property is the suppression of transverse waveguide modes in transducers. A second advantage is the ability to use thicker metal thereby reducing the resistive losses. Buried electrodes have also been shown to increase the quality factor of Surface Transverse Wave (STW) resonators [15]. This numerical model is a very useful tool for optimizing the electrode geometry. Analysis of raised electrodes is useful for predicting the effects of Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) on the SAW or STW electrical filter characteristics. RIE is commonly used as a frequency <b>trimming</b> technique for <b>SAW</b> or STW filters on Quartz.

40|$|The {{world has}} seen an unrivaled spread of {{semiconductor}} technology into virtually {{any part of}} society. The main enablers of this semiconductor rush are the decreasing feature size and the constantly decreasing costs of semiconductors. The decreasing costs of semiconductors in general are caused by the smaller feature size, the higher yield and larger production volumes. This has made products containing semiconductors cheaper in production thus reaching a larger market. The smaller feature size enables more computing power in the same volume creating new markets and growing application areas. The increasing number of appliances using semiconductor components is also driving the fast growth of the market. The trend of miniaturization of electronic components also demands the miniaturization and integration of non-electrical functions to allow for large decreases in size, weight and possibly cost. Soon after the first semiconductors were developed the first Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were also created. In the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s experiments with MEMS were done in lab environments. MEMS technology {{can be used to}} miniaturize non-electrical components thus enabling further system shrinkage and increased function density. The technologies, experiments and numerical simulations in this thesis provide MEMS designers with a design guideline in the creation process of new Wafer Level Thin Film Package (WLTFP) products as well as an overview of the most likely failure modes and high risk processes in the assembly. WLTFP’s are a miniature batch-process and wafer scale encapsulation method for MEMS that need space to move or hold a certain amount of gas. In the first chapters an overview of the most important processing steps in the production of WLTFP’s and the subsequent assembly steps needed to form a plastic encapsulated package is presented. Most common assembly steps included: wafer thinning, chip singulation, die-attach, wire bonding, overmoulding and <b>saw,</b> <b>trim,</b> mark & form. Wafer thinning is necessary to thin the chip to such a thickness that it will fit into the desired package. Chip singulation or dicing is commonly done by a diamond blade saw and makes separates the wafer into individual chips. Die-attach is the placement of the chip onto the carrier, for example a lead frame, by means of a glue. After dieattach connection the IO of the chip to the carrier can be done by wirebonding. After wire-bonding the package is overflowed by epoxy moulding compound to protect the chip inside from the environment. After finishing the package and marking it one has a complete product. In the creation process of a new MEMS product the design team is faced with a multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-timescale challenge. Nanometer dimensions can impact a millimeter size product and hours of operation can change a MEMS that performs microsecond measurements. To address this challenge an integrated design process is needed that covers the chip and wafer design as well as the package and all of the intermediate processes. An example of the influences from the package on the chip is calculated and shown in chapter three. In chapter four the properties of thin layers are investigated. In this investigation copper thin film are deposited on freestanding micro cantilevers. The samples are analyzed with white light interferometry to obtain the initial geometry properties and cantilever warpage. Using electrostatic pull-in to pull down the cantilever to the substrate the pull-in voltage is obtained. The stiffness of the two layer system can be derived from the pull-in voltage. Copper film thicknesses of 10 and 50 nanometer are measured and a size-dependant stiffness is proven. During the assembly of a WLTFP several failure modes are found. In the wafer thinning process the application of wafer thinning tape to the active side of the wafer can easily break many WLTFP’s. This can happen during the application or for example the removal of the tape. The placement of the wafer on dicing foil is also a potential risk as it leaves the MEMS exposed to the water jet of the dicing machine. Wire-bonding can be hazardous to MEMS sensitive to resonance, this risk can relatively easy be mitigated by calculation of eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. The overmoulding process and the associated process pressure can be hazardous to for example membranes or large WLTFP’s due to the static pressure on the cavity. The numerical simulations developed in chapter five provide a toolbox to check for weak spots in the design and investigate changes by virtual prototyping instead of physical prototyping. The simulations also include wafer foil application and removal simulation. The use of cohesive zones allows for a detailed investigation of the loads on the WLTFP. In chapter six the interface properties of the wafer thinning foil are investigated by means of a peeling experiment combined with numerical simulations. The characterization method yields interface properties that serve as input for aforementioned numerical simulations. The Design of Experiments presented in chapter seven investigates the influence four major design choices on the likelihood of survival during assembly. The span of the WLTFP, the corner rounding radius, cap thickness and presence of a pillar are investigated. After all 18720 samples were evaluated a design guidelines was derived. The design guideline in combination with the numerical simulations provides the MEMS design community with tools during the chip-design stage. This aids to the integrated approach of designing new MEMS and reduces the time to market and number of design iterations needed. PMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
