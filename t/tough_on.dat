5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

5|$|The {{king had}} seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was {{particularly}} <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> that province. The guerrilla Snapphane movement, in northern Scania, had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had {{strong support from}} the local villages. Charles remained sceptical about the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He did not allow soldiers from Scania in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed {{there had to be}} recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of Scania, his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679–1680), was notably brutal in his treatment of the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680–1693), proved more lenient.|$|E
5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of anti-immigrant parties in Western Europe has provoked very different responses from mainstream parties. Some {{have tried to}} counter the antiimmigrant parties, while others have tried to recapture lost voters by taking a <b>tougher</b> stance <b>on</b> immigration. Country comparative studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of different strategies, but systematic testing has been impaired by small-n problems. Therefore this paper exploits sub-national variation in 290 Swedish municipalities to investigate the effect of mainstream party strategy on anti-immigrant electoral success. The paper finds that a <b>tougher</b> stance <b>on</b> immigration of mainstream parties is correlated with more anti-immigrant party support, even when controlling for {{a large number of}} socio-economic, historical and regional factors. This result indicates that mainstream parties legitimize anti-immigrant parties by taking a <b>tougher</b> position <b>on</b> immigration. However, the results presented in the paper show that it is not enough that one mainstream party takes a tougher position, it is only when the entire political mainstream are <b>tougher</b> <b>on</b> immigration that the anti-immigrant party benefits. What is more, toughness of the parties on the left seem to be more legitimizing than the toughness of the parties on the right...|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} day after death, {{glycolysis}} continues until the accumulation of lactic acid causes the pH to reach about 5.5. The remaining glycogen, about 18g per kg, is believed to increase the water-holding capacity and tenderness of the flesh when cooked. Rigor mortis sets {{in a few hours}} after death as ATP is used up, causing actin and myosin to combine into rigid actomyosin and lowering the meat's water-holding capacity, causing it to lose water ("weep"). In muscles that enter rigor in a contracted position, actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that is <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> cooking – hence again the need to prevent pre-slaughter stress in the animal.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{approached}} stuttering {{from the}} viewpoint that the stutterer should scrutinize his stuttering behavior, {{to become aware of}} everything he did from anticipation of stuttering, to struggling during a block, and to the utterance of the word. A speech-language clinician using his methodology was to explain to her client the nature of the many attitudes and behaviors of stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1929, the Lopez family began {{migrating}} {{north for}} work. In that year, {{they arrived in}} Arvin, CA in the San Joaquin Valley {{and worked as a}} crew picking cotton. Her Aunt Maria, who Jessie recalled as her sister because of their close age and sister like relationship, was killed in a tragic accident when her dress caught fire, causing her to perish. In January 1930, her mother Guadalupe fell ill and was bedridden by February. She died on March 11, 1930 and was laid to rest in Compton, CA. After the death of their mother, Lopez and her sisters moved back to Anaheim with their grandparents. Her grandfather Basillo returned to cotton picking in the San Gabriel Valley to support them, but fell ill shortly after and died of dropsy on June 14, 1930. The depression years were <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> the Lopez family. In 1931 they became migrant workers again, often sleeping roadside in a tent.|$|E
25|$|Being <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> {{crime was}} a major plank of Pataki's {{campaign}} for governor. In 2011, the administration touted statistics that illustrated that crime had steadily reduced during the 11 years Pataki had served as governor, bringing New York from the 6th most dangerous {{state in the nation}} to the 7th safest. During his time in office, he signed into law over 100 new bills to change New York’s criminal statutes. In 1995, Governor Pataki was able to uphold a campaign promise by reinstating capital punishment in New York with the Sentencing Reform Act. The reinstatement of the death penalty was later suspended by the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) in a 4–3 decision. In 2000, Pataki helped lead the legislature in passing some of the then-strictest gun control laws in the country. Numerous aspects of the bill had been put forward by members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly but had never made it through the Republican held Senate. With numerous mass shootings in recent public memory, he urged a number of Republican Senators to support the bill, eventually passing it in a bipartisan effort. His administration also launched programs such as SAF-T (Statewide Anti-Fugitive Teams) and the 100 Most Wanted. The initiatives were aimed at disseminating descriptions of criminals who were evading law enforcement officials to promote the ability of average citizens to help aid in their capture. Versions of Megan's Law and Kendra's Law were integrated into New York's laws under the governor {{as well as a number}} of reforms to the Rockefeller Drug Laws. The changes to the Rockefeller laws were largely focused on inmates' ability to appeal for an early release from sentences that were passed on them under mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.|$|E
