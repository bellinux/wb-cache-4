Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E
5|$|At Indian Wells, Murray {{struggled}} {{in his first}} two matches against Lukáš Rosol and Jiří Veselý respectively, overcoming both in close three-set encounters to set up a fourth round clash with Canadian Milos Raonic, which he lost in three sets. Murray offered to play with 2012 Wimbledon Doubles champion Jonathan Marray, because Marray was unable to convince anyone to join him on court. For Murray and Marray's first competitive match together, they won a doubles clash against Gaël Monfils and Juan Mónaco only to lose in the second round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No</b> 2 seeds Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.|$|E
5|$|Bowling in {{the middle}} of the innings, she then took 1/17 from five overs, her maiden wicket being Thirush Kamini caught behind by wicket-keeper Jodie Fields for one run, leaving India at 5/71 in the 26th over. She then claimed two catches to {{complete}} the eighth and ninth wickets—those of tail-enders Amita Sharma and Nooshin Al Khadeer—as Australia won by 86 runs. Ebsary went on to play in the last four matches of the series. She was promoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 4 position in the next match, but failed to capitalise on her opportunity, making a duck. She bowled five overs without taking a wicket in a 54-run win. She then made 32 from 43 balls as an opener, hitting six boundaries in the fourth ODI at Manuka Oval in Canberra, helping to set up a 118-run win. In the final match, she took 1/13 from four overs, taking the wicket of leading Indian batsman Mithali Raj and was not required to bat in a seven-wicket win. She ended her debut series with 37 runs at 18.50 and two wickets at 34.50 at an economy rate of 3.83. Australia took the series 5–0 in a dominant display; all their wins were by at least seven wickets or 54 runs.|$|E

It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor. For Braham, progress was slow and {{he made his first}} solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction. On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo {{for the first time in}} a Tiger Moth. In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft. Now assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart. He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase of training in the Hawker Fury.

Traveling to Morgantown, West Virginia, home of West Virginia University, the third-ranked Hokies lost 28–7 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 23 Mountaineers. The loss was Tech's worst since November 2001, and knocked the previously undefeated Hokies out of contention {{for the national}} championship. The Hokies returned home to face another high-ranking opponent, No.2 Miami. Recovering from the loss against West Virginia, the Hokies delivered one of the highest-profile wins in school history, defeating the second-ranked Hurricanes 31–7. The game ended a 39-game regular-season winning streak by Miami and was Tech's first victory over a top-eight team in 34games.|$|E
5|$|In the 1992 Busch Series, Robinson {{moved to}} Silver Racing, driving the No. 21 Oldsmobile. Robinson began {{the season with}} a 34th-place finish in the Goody's 300, and was {{involved}} in an accident after completing 67 laps. Before the Champion 300, Robinson moved to the Pharo Racing No. 33 car after she was released by Silver Racing, and later moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 25 vehicle owned by Laughlin Racing. Although she struggled during her rookie season, she performed well in July and August, where she finished eleventh (her best of the season) in the Firecracker 200 at Volusia County Speedway, and she equaled the result at Michigan International Speedway. Robinson finished 38th in the final Busch Series championship standings, and was second in the NASCAR Busch Series Rookie of the Year behind Ricky Craven despite her abbreviated schedule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} Master Series tournament of the US Hard Court season, the Cincinnati Masters, Murray {{defeated}} veteran Mardy Fish {{in the second}} round, and then beat both Grigor Dimitrov and Richard Gasquet in three-set matches, having {{to come from a}} set down on both occasions, while Dimitrov had served for the match in the deciding set. In the semifinal, he lost to defending champion Roger Federer in straight sets, and after Federer {{went on to win the}} tournament, this result saw Murray return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 3 ranking and seeding for the US Open. At the US Open, Murray beat Nick Kyrgios in four sets before beating Adrian Mannarino in five sets after being two sets down, equaling Federer for winning eight matches from two sets to love down. He then beat Thomaz Bellucci in straight sets but suffered a defeat in the fourth round to Kevin Anderson in four sets.

5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light, but when Sanderson began writing the book it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was then split into three volumes: The Gathering Storm, Towers of Midnight, and A Memory of Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E
5|$|Lin did {{not play}} in the 2013 All-Star Game, held in Houston, after {{finishing}} third in the voting behind Bryant and Chris Paul for the two starting guards of the Western Conference.

His scoring, shooting percentage, and 3-point percentage improved after the All-Star break, and he finished with season averages of 13.4 points and 6.1 assists. Lin and center Ömer Aşık were the only Rockets to play in all 82 games. Houston qualified for the playoffs, but lost in the first round in six games <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder. Lin suffered a bruised chest in Game 2, which limited him in Game 3 and sidelined him for the two games after. He returned for the final game, coming off the bench for three points in 13 minutes.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Devitt, Taguchi and Hirooki Goto {{won their}} second J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament {{in a row}} by {{defeating}} the team of Giant Bernard, Jushin Thunder Liger and Karl Anderson in the finals of the three-day-long tournament. On 24 July, Devitt received his rematch for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship at a DDT event, {{but was unable to}} regain the title from Ibushi. This led to a match on 14 August, where Apollo 55 successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against the Golden☆Lovers. On 11 September, Apollo 55 defeated Taichi and Taka Michinoku to make their seventh successful IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship defense, breaking the record for most defenses during a single reign.

On 19 September, Devitt defeated Kushida to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On 10 October at Destruction '11, Devitt and Taguchi lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No</b> Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero). Devitt made the first successful title defense of his second IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship reign on 12 November at Power Struggle, defeating Taka Michinoku, and followed that up by defeating the man who had pinned him for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, Davey Richards, in his second defense on 4 December. On 23 December, Devitt defeated the other half of No Remorse Corps, Rocky Romero, to make his third IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship defense. On 4 January 2012 at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Devitt and Taguchi defeated Richards and Romero to once again regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, starting Devitt's record-breaking sixth reign as one half of the champions. On 12 February at The New Beginning, Apollo 55 lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No</b> Remorse Corps in their first defense.

5|$|Several cars {{suffered}} issues {{during the}} second safety car period. Nicki Thiim brought the No. 95 Aston Martin from the LMGTE Pro lead straight to the team's garage with a leaking power steering system, handing the class lead to its sister No. 99 Aston Martin. Christian Ried in the No. 88 Proton Porsche suffered an engine fire in the second Mulsanne Straight chicane, extending the safety car period as it was tended to. KCMG retained their LMP2 class lead ahead of the TDS Racing car while behind the safety car, while the sole Corvette, No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, and two circulating Aston Martin vehicles were nose to tail in LMGTE Pro, continuing their battle after the safety car period ended. Oliver Gavin's Corvette eventually {{pulled away from the}} rest of the LMGTE Pro field. The Riley Viper relinquished its lead in LMGTE Am <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and the SMP Ferrari driven by François Perrodo. As the safety car period ended the No. 17 Porsche of Hartley held the race lead, but Albuquerque was in pursuit in the No. 9 Audi, breaking the Le Mans lap record with a time of three minutes and 17.647 seconds. The No. 9 Audi was able to mount a better challenge to the leading Porsche, and René Rast was able to take the race lead after pit stops.|$|E

5|$|The French Navy {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} her anti-aircraft armament {{in light of}} its wartime experience. Her no. 3 gun turret was to be moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 4 position, its magazine converted for extra fuel storage, and a new twin 37mm Mle 1933 mount would replace {{it on top of}} the rear deck house. Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted {{on each side of the}} rear deckhouse and a fourth mount was to replace the 13.2Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge. One 13.2mm Browning machine gun was to planned to be mounted on each side of the forward twin 37mm guns. This plan was later amended to add a degaussing cable, replacement of the SS-6 sonar by a French copy of the British ASDIC and six of the new mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940 anti-aircraft guns, plus two more 13.2mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house.|$|E
5|$|With two Audis out, {{this left}} the lone No. 1 Audi {{to take over}} the race lead, with the two Peugeots four and six laps behind respectively. Just before <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 2 Audi's accident, the GT1-leading Aston Martin had also come off the track, {{damaging}} its front splitter. The necessary repairs led to the car spending eight minutes in the garage, dropping it to fourth in class. The lone factory Corvette gained a place to take over second in class. Scuderia Ecosse's Ferrari briefly took over the GT2 lead after Risi's problems, but it too broke down on the track, handing the lead to the IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche. Binnie Motorsport's entry had a sizable lead in its class, having not suffered the many problems its LMP2 competitors had.|$|E
5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} rear spoiler.

Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>No.</b> 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked early for the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
