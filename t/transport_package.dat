50|$|Package {{cushioning}} {{is used to}} {{help protect}} fragile items during shipment. It is common for a <b>transport</b> <b>package</b> to be dropped, kicked, and impacted: These events may produce potentially damaging shocks. Transportation vibration from conveyors, trucks, railroads, or aircraft can also damage some items. Shock and vibration are controlled by cushioning so that the chance of product damage is greatly reduced.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thermal evaluation {{is to determine the}} temperature distribution in the <b>transport</b> <b>package</b> which occurs during normal and hypothetical accident conditions of the performance requirements of 10 CFR 71 and to establish temperature effects on the package components and their performance, as these effects relate to safety and compliance with the regulations. The Model 2000 <b>Transport</b> <b>Package</b> has been fully analyzed and certified for use by Nuclear Regulatory Commission for up to 600 watts contents thermal loading [3. 1]. In addition, the analytical model for the <b>Transport</b> <b>Package</b> has also been verified by the actual thermal testing at ambient condition for both 600 watts and 2000 watts contents thermal loading, which is presented in Reference [3. 2]. This Chapter presents the thermal analyses of the Model 2000 <b>Transport</b> <b>Package</b> with a contents thermal loading of 2000 watts, specifically, Subsections 3. 4 and 3. 5 for normal and accident transport conditions, and those of the Multifunctional rack loaded with Cs 137 capsules, presented in Subsection 3. 7. The results of these analyses show that the package with the proposed content performs within all regulatory limits. Also, additional analyses demonstrated that the location of the sources within the cask cavity is not critical in meeting the regulatory requirements. See Subsection 3. 7. 4...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{necessary}} prerequisites to design cushioned package is {{the determination of}} product shock fragility, which is so far obtained by means of destructive method on shock testing machines. This paper presents a non-destructive method [...] power flow method to predict the product fragility. The <b>transport</b> <b>package</b> system was first divided into two subsystems to simplify analysis. The energy of critical component of the product was then calculated by applying a power flow equilibrium equation. And finally, {{the parameters of the}} <b>transport</b> <b>package</b> system, such as the input power, the internal loss factor and the coupling loss factor, were discussed...|$|E
