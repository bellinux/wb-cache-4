50|$|The {{first steps}} in {{security}} and justice cooperation within the EU began in 1975 when the <b>TREVI</b> <b>group</b> was created, composed of member states' justice and home affairs ministers. The first real cooperation was {{the signing of}} the Schengen Implementing Convention in 1990 which opened up the EU's internal borders and established the Schengen Area. In parallel the Dublin Regulation furthered police cooperation.|$|E
40|$|Since the European Union Treaty (1992), {{there have}} been two {{contrasting}} conceptions of how one should approach EU political union. From the EU standpoint, this process is a gain, but from the Statesâ€™ point of view a loss. There is, however a third logic thatmakes up the EU: that of third country immigrants residing in the Member States (Euroimmigrants). In contrast with the two previously cited logics, for this population the same process is neither a gain nor a loss, but simply something that is being discussed and carried out without taking them into consideration. This lack of attention shows that at present the treatment of Euroimmigrants is following a state fundamentalist logic and not a multicultural logic as would be historically appropriate for the EU. In the interests of allowing a discussion of this argument, this paper presents relevant considerations in four steps: the first section presents the theoretical framework that will be followed on focusing the discussion; the second section sets out what is called state fundamentalism with a brief historical review of how the European States have treated immigrants politically; the third section sums up how the EU dealt with immigration from the <b>Trevi</b> <b>Group</b> of 1975 until the Amsterdam Treaty (1997); and the fourth and final section, contains closing comments that, with reference to the Tampere Summit (1999), highlight the normative dilemmas and institutional challenges that are the product {{of the relationship between the}} EU and the presence of Euroimmigrants...|$|E
40|$|International {{cooperation}} in police matters {{is certainly not}} new but cooperation among European Union member states has clearly experienced a qualitative leap since 1980. To understand its rapid development one must understand certain contextual elements {{as well as its}} development. We review the pre-Schengen history (the <b>Trevi</b> <b>Groups),</b> followed by the history of Schengen up until the new Amsterdam Treaties (from 1985 until the signature of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997), and then analyze what these new treaties mean for the evolution of Schengen (particularly the whole integration of the Schengen acquis into the treaties), and finally make a critical assessment...|$|R
