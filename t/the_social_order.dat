5|$|Quoting the Jewish rabbi and scholar Jacob Neusner, Pope Benedict XVI {{explains}} that to Israel, keeping this commandment {{was more than}} ritual; {{it was a way}} to imitate God, who rested on the seventh day after the creation.

5|$|The highly {{decorative}} Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, {{and perfectly}} reflected <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order</b> {{of the island}} at a time when, nominally ruled by Spain, {{it was in fact}} governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated.

5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were {{challenges to the}} Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some extent}} a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the challenges to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order</b> were quashed.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a set of}} {{outcomes}} that affect {{the welfare of the}} members of a group, K. J. Arrow imposed the following five conditions on the ordering of the outcomes {{as a function of the}} preferences of the individual group members, and then proved that the conditions are logically inconsistent:- <b>The</b> <b>social</b> choice rule is defined for a large family of assignments of transitive orderings to individuals. - <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>ordering</b> itself is always transitive. - <b>The</b> <b>social</b> choice rule is not dictatorial. (An individual is a dictator if <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>ordering</b> ranks an outcome x strictly above another outcome y whenever that individual strictly prefers x to y.) - If everyone in the group strictly prefers outcome x to outcome y, then x should rank strictly above y in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>ordering.</b> - <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>ordering</b> of any two outcomes depends only on the way that the individuals in the group order those same two outcomes. The chapter proves Arrow's theorem and investigates the possibility of uncovering a satisfactory social choice rule by relaxing the conditions while remaining within the Arrovian framework, which is identified by the following five characteristics:- The outcome set is unstructured. - The society is finite and fixed. - Only information about the ordering of the outcome set is used to convey information about individual welfare. - The output of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> choice process is an ordering of the outcome set. - Strategic play by individuals is not considered. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> term <b>social</b> <b>order</b> {{can be used}} in two senses. In {{the first}} sense, it refers to a {{particular}} set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and <b>the</b> capitalist <b>social</b> <b>order.</b> In <b>the</b> second sense, <b>social</b> <b>order</b> is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which <b>the</b> existing <b>social</b> <b>order</b> is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that <b>social</b> <b>orders</b> exist at all.|$|R
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order</b> to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were {{transformed}} from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} {{at the dinner table}} or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC. These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order.</b> The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E
40|$|We study <b>social</b> <b>ordering</b> {{functions}} in exchange economies.

5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order</b> in life.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige {{of even the most}} powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order,</b> yet they represented only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make a decent living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order</b> to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, {{became one of the}} most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation. Among his best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading portrait painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E

5|$|In his {{autobiography}} Belgrano {{declared that he}} did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment took him by surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to make big changes in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>order.</b> One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.|$|E
