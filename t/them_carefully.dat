5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> lodged in {{the archives of the}} Society, where the world in general, or even the members of the Society, would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 and {{especially}} in 1877, several other artists spent the summer in Skagen, using the Brøndums' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings. Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home. He became engaged to Anna Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880. Their home then became {{a focal point for}} the artists, especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher's painting Will He Round the Point?. Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family's inn, leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day. She studied <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> and in 1875 attended Vilhelm Kyhn's art school in Copenhagen. She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people in their everyday lives and making full use of colour. Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878, encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin. He brought many of the latest international art trends with him, influencing {{the other members of the}} group. His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland {{the highest}} of these was the feis at Teamhair na Rí (Tara), which was held every third Samhain. This was a {{gathering}} of the leading men of the whole island – kings, lords, chieftains, druids, judges etc. Below this was the óenach (modern spelling: aonach). These were regional or provincial gatherings open to everyone. Examples include that held at Tailtin each Lughnasadh, and that held at Uisneach each Bealtaine. The main purpose of these gatherings was to promulgate and reaffirm the laws – they were read aloud in public {{that they might not}} be forgotten, and any changes in <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> explained to those present.|$|E

2500|$|James {{initially}} {{had difficulty}} finding a publisher, {{according to his}} widow Selma James, but on its publication by Hutchinson Beyond a Boundary was well received, and John Arlott wrote in Wisden:"1963 {{has been marked by}} the publication of a cricket book so outstanding as to compel any reviewer to check his adjectives several times before he describes it and, since he is likely to be dealing in superlatives, to measure <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> to avoid over-praise – which this book does not need … in the opinion of the reviewer, it is the finest book written about the game of cricket." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{is widely}} {{known as a}} writer on cricket, {{especially}} for his autobiographical 1963 book, Beyond a Boundary, which he himself described as [...] "neither cricket reminiscences nor autobiography". It is considered a seminal work on the game, and is often named as the best single book on cricket (or even the best book on any sport) ever written. John Arlott called it [...] "so outstanding as to compel any reviewer to check his adjectives several times before he describes it and, since {{he is likely to}} be dealing in superlatives, to measure <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> to avoid over-praise – which this book does not need … in the opinion of the reviewer, it is the finest book written about the game of cricket." [...] A conference to mark the 50th anniversary of its first publication was held 10–11 May 2013.|$|E
2500|$|The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes characterised Sir Roderic's song [...] "When {{the night}} wind howls" [...] as [...] "unquestionably the finest piece of {{descriptive}} music that Sullivan ever wrote, {{worthy of a}} place beside Schubert's Erlkönig, Wagner's overture to The Flying Dutchman, and well above Saint-Saëns' Danse macabre, {{all of which are}} tone-paintings in a similar colour. Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to A flat major and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of B flat major. The progressions that follow look to be unusual, but if we study <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> we realise that here Sullivan is not feeling his way in unfamiliar territory. Rather we may find in these few bars an apotheosis of his matured harmonic resource." ...|$|E
2500|$|All of Voldemort's {{deliberately}} created Horcruxes {{were made}} using objects {{that had been}} important to him or that held some sentimental value. He hid some of <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> {{so that no one}} could find and destroy them, but used Nagini to do his bidding on several occasions, and the diary was always intended to be a weapon to carry out Voldemort's plan to remove Muggle-borns from Hogwarts. Even without magical protection, Horcruxes cannot be destroyed by any means of wand usage or physical force. [...] In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry intentionally destroys the diary with a Basilisk fang, although unaware it was a Horcrux at the time, to free Ginny from its influence. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the discovery of the diary is revealed as the proof that leads to Dumbledore beginning the hunt for other Horcruxes, as it not only gives absolute proof that Voldemort split his soul, but also that there were likely other, better protected artifacts, given the risk Voldemort was taking by using the diary as a weapon.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1978, the Bloomingdale, Illinois Police Department {{received}} an anonymous letter. The letter stated, [...] "This letter is {{to inform you}} that you have a couple in your town who strictly make their living on selling drugs. They are Sue and Lance Gates, who live on Greenway, off Bloomingdale Rd. in the condominiums. Most of their buys are done in Florida. Sue, his wife, drives their car to Florida, where she leaves it to be loaded up with drugs, then Lance flies down and drives it back. Sue flies back after she drops the car off in Florida. May 3 she is driving down there again and the car back he has the trunk loaded with over $100,000.00 in drugs. Presently they have over $100,000.00 worth of drugs in their basement. They brag about the fact they never have to work, and make their entire living on pushers. I guarantee, if you watch <b>them</b> <b>carefully</b> you will make a big catch. They are friends with some big drug dealers who visit their house often." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 8, 1927, their appeals exhausted, Sacco and Vanzetti {{were finally}} {{sentenced to death}} in the {{electric}} chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that an automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Major Calvin Goddard in 1927. [...] Major Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco’s [...]32 Savage Model 1907, the bullet that allegedly killed Berardelli, and the spent casings allegedly recovered from the scene of the crime. [...] (Defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti claim that the bullet and cartridge case linked to Sacco's pistol were substituted for genuine evidence by the Massachusetts police.) In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired several test bullets from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and prepared them for a comparative examination. [...] He then put the ejected shell casings on the comparison microscope next to casings recovered at the South Braintree murder scene. [...] Then he analyzed <b>them</b> <b>carefully.</b> [...] The third bullet, designated Bullet III matched the rifling marks found on the barrel of Sacco's pistol, while firing pin marks on a [...]32 spent casing recovered from the murder scene matched a test shell casing known to have been fired from Sacco's pistol. [...] Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions. Nicola Sacco [...] and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were found guilty and executed via electrocution in Massachusetts on August 23, 1927.|$|E
