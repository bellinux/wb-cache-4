5|$|As King William {{intensely}} disliked <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> and Conroy, {{he vowed}} to wait until Victoria came of age to die simply {{to keep them from}} a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> and her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Following her marriage, Anne was styled as Her Royal Highness <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of York.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Victoria became {{seriously ill}} of typhoid fever {{on the last}} of the royal tours. Exploiting her {{weakened}} state, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> and Conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document; this document would have appointed Conroy her personal secretary upon her accession. Victoria emerged from the incident more determined than ever to become self-reliant. Her increased intransigence alarmed <b>the</b> <b>Duchess.</b> At her behest, family adviser Baron Stockmar investigated, recommending to <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> that she dismiss Conroy and make peace with her daughter. But Conroy easily convinced <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> to ignore Stockmar's advice. Even after Victoria's eighteenth birthday on 24 May 1837, Conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty-one.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Kent's new comptroller, Sir George Couper, {{studied the}} old accounts. He found huge discrepancies. No records for her {{household}} or personal expenses {{had been kept}} after 1829. There was also no record of nearly £50,000 <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> had received from her brother, Leopold, nor of an additional £10,000 from William IV.|$|E
5|$|King William {{appointed}} his friend, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Northumberland, as Victoria's official governess in 1831, but {{the role}} was mostly ceremonial, and the princess continued {{to depend on}} Lehzen. <b>The</b> <b>Duchess</b> was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria's mother, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Kent, for attempting to become more influential in Victoria's education. During this time, Lehzen held no official position at court; despite her recently acquired title, her commoner status {{continued to be a}} hindrance.|$|E

Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, for whom <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Gloucester, {{one of the}} few children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got {{up in the middle of}} the service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E

Eight days later, Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov family had been burnt, and discovered the corpse of a King Charles Spaniel at the site. In 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> herself.|$|E

5|$|Princess Victoria grew to hate Conroy, {{thanks to}} the oppressive system, {{and he was also}} unpopular among the rest of the British royal family. His efforts to place <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> in the role of regent were {{ultimately}} unsuccessful, as Victoria ascended the throne after reaching her majority in 1837. Conroy was immediately expelled from Victoria's household, though he remained in <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Kent's service for several more years. Given a pension and a baronetcy, Conroy retired to his estate near Reading, Berkshire, in 1842 and died heavily in debt twelve years later.|$|E
5|$|The Princess Sophia {{was born}} at Buckingham House, London on 3 November 1777, the twelfth child and fifth {{daughter}} of King George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The young princess was christened on 1 December 1777 in the Great Council Chamber at St James's Palace by Frederick Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury. Her godparents were Prince August of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (her first cousin once-removed), <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (her first cousin twice-removed) and <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Mecklenburg (wife of her first cousin once-removed), {{all of whom were}} represented by proxies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 a year from her mother, <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the younger}} {{generations of the}} family, Louise's {{favourite}} relatives were the Duke and Duchess of Kent, her grandnephew and his wife.

5|$|As a {{young man}} destined {{to serve in the}} navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was {{stationed}} in Malta. There, he grew close to {{and fell in love with}} his uncle's daughter, Princess Marie. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess of Wales and <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Edinburgh—both opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and <b>the</b> <b>Duchess</b> of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, the heir to the King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E
