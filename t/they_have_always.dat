5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been male.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|Turn-ups on {{the bottom}} of trousers, or cuffs, were {{initially}} popularised in the 1890s by Edward VII, and were popular with suits throughout the 1920s and 1930s. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been an informal option, being inappropriate on all formalwear.|$|E
25|$|The {{existing}} {{units are}} the only commercial reactors currently in use in the USA that were engineered to operate on 100% MOX fuel cores, however because nuclear fuel is not reprocessed in the USA <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> operated on fresh UOX fuel.|$|E
25|$|Presupposing that a {{sequence}} {{of events in the}} future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the laws of physics will hold as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of uniformity of nature.|$|E

25|$|At this point, Saint Pierre and Miquelon {{represent}} the sole remaining vestige of France's once vast North American possessions. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been most {{important as a}} fishing centre, being in easy travelling distance of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, some of the world's richest fishing grounds. However, they are slowly diversifying their economy into tourism and other activities, {{with the assistance of}} the French government.|$|E
25|$|Tripura {{entered the}} Ranji Trophy, along with Goa and Himachal Pradesh, when the {{competition}} was expanded for the 1985-86 season. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{been one of the}} weaker sides in the competition. Up to the end of 2016, they had played 159 first-class matches resulting in eight wins, 102 losses and 49 draws. In List A cricket they had played 91 matches resulting in nine wins, 81 loses and one no-result.|$|E
25|$|Amargosa voles have a {{very small}} range, limited only to certain parts of California. They are endemic to parts of the Mojave Desert in Inyo County. Their current range is mostly {{contained}} along a 10-mile stretch of the Amargosa River and its associated tributaries and marshes. Although their historic range is not fully understood, it is thought <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> had a very small range, limited by life history requirements.|$|E

25|$|The Alpine {{factory in}} Dieppe {{continued}} to expand; in the 1980s they built the special R5 Turbo cars, following the rear engined formula <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> used. They built all Clio Williams and RenaultSport Spiders. The factory put its Alpine badges {{on the early}} batches of the mid-engined Clio series one Clio V6. The Clio Series 2 was also assembled there with more recent RenaultSport Clio 172 and RenaultSport Clio 182s.|$|E
25|$|As for the Hellenes, {{it seems}} {{obvious to me that}} ever since they came into {{existence}} <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I do not think the Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the United Kingdom, {{the monarch}} {{is the only}} member of the Royal Family with a title {{established}} through Canadian law. It would be possible for others to be granted distinctly Canadian titles (as is the case for the Duke of Rothesay (Prince Charles) in Scotland), but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been, and continue to only be, accorded the use of a courtesy title in Canada, which is that which they have been granted via letters patent in the UK, though they are also in Canada translated to French.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} in 2014, Kretschmer's parents stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> loved their son and that <b>they</b> did not <b>have</b> an explanation for his actions. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> since changed their name {{and moved to a}} different city.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the posts}} of leader and party {{president}} of Fianna Fáil are separate, {{with the former}} elected by the Parliamentary Party and the latter elected by the Ardfheis (thus allowing for the posts to be held by different people, in theory), in practice <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been held by the one person. However, as the Ardfheis may have already been held {{in any given year}} by the time a new leader is elected, the selection of the new party president might not take place until the next year.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other insects, {{the wing}} {{muscles of the}} Ephemeroptera (Mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) insert {{directly}} at the wing bases, which are hinged so that a small movement of the wing base downward, lifts the wing itself upward, very much like rowing through the air. Dragonflies and damselflies have fore and hind wings similar in shape and size. Each operates independently, which gives a degree of fine control and mobility {{in terms of the}} abruptness with which they can change direction and speed, not seen in other flying insects. This is not surprising, given that odonates are all aerial predators, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> hunted other airborne insects.|$|E
25|$|In the Mark Millar penned Fantastic Four 566-569, Doom {{received}} a significant power upgrade. He was thrown {{back in time}} (perhaps about 50million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought through time and space {{to get back to}} the present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues, this seems to have been ignored, however, with writers treating Doctor Doom the way <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> before in terms of power, the arc later retroactively being said to have been a dream had by Valeria Richards.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{indigenous}} {{group in}} the state are the Zapotecs at about 350,000 people or about 31% of the total indigenous population. The Zapotec have an extremely long history in the Central Valleys region and unlike other indigenous groups, {{do not have a}} migration story. For them, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been here. Zapotecs have always called themselves Be'ena'a, which means The People. Zapotec territory extends in and around the Central Valleys region of the state, around the capital city of Oaxaca. The Zapotec language has historically been and is still the most widely spoken in the state, with four dialects that correspond to the four subdivisions of these people: Central Valleys and Isthmus, the Sierra de Ixtlan, Villa Alta and Coapan. Zapotec communities can be found in 67 municipalities. The various Zapotec dialects account for 64 of the total 173 still surviving forms of Oto-Manguean.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} {{paneling}} generally, there were, {{during the last}} fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the linenfold design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at Bere Regis, Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.|$|E
25|$|Kathy returns a {{few days}} later and meets with Ben, who is furious to see her again after several years of believing she was dead. He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> loved him. Ian later decides to rebuild his relationship with his mother and allows Kathy to move into his house. Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking she cares more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned. Phil returns home severely injured and Ian allows Kathy to move back into his house. Gavin later holds Kathy, Ben and Phil hostage in their house and when Sharon confronts him, he reveals himself as her father before fleeing. Kathy is given a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to fraud.|$|E
60|$|After {{some time}} some little {{partridges}} who were hopping about heard the poor panther's groans, {{and went up}} to see what was the matter. He had never tried to make his dinner off them, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been quite friendly.|$|R
