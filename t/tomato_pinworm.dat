When field tested they showed {{resistance to the}} tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), tomato fruitworm (Heliothis zea), the <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> (Keiferia lycopersicella) and the tomato fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera). A 91-day feeding trial in rats showed no adverse effects, but the Bt tomato has never been commercialised. Tomatoes resistant to a root knot nematode have been created by inserting a cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene from taro. A chemically synthesised ceropin B gene, usually found in the giant silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia), has been introduced into tomato plants and in vivo studies show significant resistance to bacterial wilt and bacterial spot. When the cell wall proteins, polygalacturonase and expansin are prevented from being produced in fruits, they are less susceptible to the fungus Botrytis cinerea than normal tomatoes.

A presença de alguns desses compostos tem sido associada à resistência do tomate a diferentes insetos. A traça-do-tomateiro, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), é uma das pragas mais nocivas da América do Sul. O adulto oviposita sobre as folhas do tomate e suas larvas abrem galerias no mesófilo das folhas, ramos, flores e frutos. As espécies silvestres do tomate conservam a capacidade de biossintetizar compostos químicos que lhes conferem resistência a esta praga. No presente trabalho, foi avaliada a preferência para oviposição desse inseto sobre folhas com e sem tricomas glandulares de L. esculentum (Mill.) cv. Uco Plata, suscetível, e de L. hirsutum f. glabratum (Mull.) PI 134417, espécie silvestre afim ao tomate, e resistente à traça. Os resultados sugerem que as fêmeas ovipositam indistintamente sobre as folhas de ambas espécies, independentemente da presença, ou não, dos tricomas glandulares. E a presença destes e de seus exsudatos não têm efeito inibidor na oviposição do inseto.

40|$|A traça-do-tomateiro foi constatada pela primeira vez no Brasil em 1980 estando hoje dentre as principais pragas da tomaticultura nacional. O controle desta praga é feito principalmente por inseticidas, sendo realizada em casos extremos, até três pulverizações semanais. Acessos silvestres de tomateiro como S. pennellii LA- 716 possuem resistência a pragas, mediada pela presença de acilaçúcares nos folíolos. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram obter genótipos de tomateiro com características comerciais e altos teores foliares de acilaçúcares (AA), e avaliar seus níveis de resistência à traça do tomateiro Tuta absoluta. Os genótipos foram obtidos a partir de populações segregantes (F 2) oriundas do cruzamento entre AF- 8665 (linhagem elite com baixos teores de AA) e as linhagens BPX 370 E- 30 - 275 - 11 - 7, BPX 370 E- 30 - 275 - 11 - 8, BPX 370 E- 30 - 380 - 68 - 6 e BPX 370 E- 30 - 380 - 68 - 8 (linhagens pré-comerciais com altos teores, obtidas a partir do cruzamento interespecífico S. lycopersicum x S. pennellii LA- 716). Plantas F 2 previamente selecionadas com base nos teores de AA foram clonadas e em seguida testadas quanto à resistência à traça-do-tomateiro. Genótipos selecionados para altos teores de AA expressaram menor ovoposição da traça e níveis inferiores de danos causados à planta pela infestação do microlepidóptero do que genótipos (comerciais ou não) com baixos teores de AA. Embora genótipos com altos teores de AA tenham sido mais resistentes à traça do que os demais, seus níveis de resistência podem ser dependentes do {{background}} genotípico: clones BPX- 410 H (alto teor de AA) mostraram-se em geral ligeiramente mais resistentes do que o dos clones BPX- 370 G (também alto teor de AA). Os clones BPX- 410 H- 01 pl# 281, BPX- 410 H- 04 pl# 348 e BPX- 410 H- 04 pl# 481 foram superiores nas avaliações de resistência à traça e são recomendados para a continuidade do programa de melhoramento. The South American <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> {{was first}} detected in Brazil in 1980 and {{today it is}} among the major pests of tomato in Brazil. The control of this pest has been done primarily {{with the use of}} insecticides, and three sprays per week may be necessary in extreme cases. Wild tomato accessions such as S. pennellii LA- 716 possess high levels of insect resistance, mediated by high foliar contents of acylsugars. The objectives of this study were obtain improved tomato genotypes with high contents of leaf acylsugars, and to assess their levels of resistance to the South American <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> Tuta absoluta. These genotypes were obtained from segregating (F 2) populations from the cross between AF- 8665 (an elite low AS tomato line) and lines BPX 370 E- 30 - 275 - 11 - 7, BPX 370 E- 30 - 275 - 11 - 8, BPX 370 E- 30 - 380 - 68 - 6 and BPX 370 E- 30 - 380 - 68 - 8 (pre-commercial high AS inbreds derived from an original interspecific cross between S. lycopersicum x S. pennellii LA- 716). F 2 plants selected for high AS contents were cloned and subsequently tested for pinworm resistance. The high AS genotypes showed smaller ovoposition counts and lower plant damage levels than low AS genotypes (commercial or not). Even though high AS genotypes were generally more resistant to the South American <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> than low AS genotypes, their actual levels of resistance may be background-dependent: high AS clones with BPX- 410 H background had slightly higher levels of resistance than high AS clones with BPX- 370 G background. Clones BPX- 410 H- 01 pl# 281, BPX- 410 H- 04 pl# 348 and BPX- 410 H- 04 pl# 481 had the highest levels of pinworm resistance, and were recommended for further use in breeding programs...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{complexity}} of {{both natural and}} managed ecosystems involves various forms of interaction among organisms. Two or more species that exploit the same resource can engage in competitive behaviours, usually referred to as intraguild interactions. These can be direct, i. e. one species feeds directly upon the competitor (intraguild predation) or indirect, e. g. when the dominant organism competes for a food source that another organism is feeding upon (kleptoparasitism). We investigated the potential for such interactions in a biological model composed by the South American <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm,</b> Tuta absoluta, and three of its newly associated natural enemies: the zoophytophagous predator Nesidiocoris tenuis and the two idiobiont ectoparasitoids Bracon nigricans and Necremnus tutae. RESULTS: N. tenuis was shown (i) to scavenge on parasitised T. absoluta larvae and (ii) directly to attack and feed upon larvae of both parasitoid species, although at a higher percentage {{in the case of}} N. tutae. In the presence of the host plant, the predator reduced the emergence of both B. nigricans and N. tutae adults significantly. CONCLUSION: This study stresses the ecological success of a generalist predator over indigenous parasitoids attacking an invasive pest. Moreover, these findings provide potential elements for better design of biological control programmes against T. absoluta...|$|E

Laboratory tests were undergone to evaluate the potential of 32 European species/strains of Trichogramma parasitoids for biological control of Tuta absoluta in Europe. The 32 species/strains tested were selected because (i) they represent the biodiversity in European Trichogramma species, (ii) they were collected on similar hosts (size and/or ecology) than T. absoluta or on hosts that were on tomato plants, and (iii) they have some potential for mass rearing (i. e. cost effective industrial production). Parasitism rate of T. absoluta eggs on tomato leaves was compared among species/strains. Four strains were selected as potentially efficient biological control agents because they showed higher or equal parasitism rate than the currently available Trichogramma species already commercialized against T. absoluta in Europe (T. achaeae). The fitness was assessed for these four species on one generation, and sex-ratio, parasitism rate, longevity and morphological traits were also evaluated. For these four strains, parasitoids that emerged from T. absoluta eggs showed good parasitism capacity but some fitness-related traits proved to decrease.

The are no registered residential or public health uses for methamidophos. The Agency estimates that 640, 000 pounds of active ingredients are applied nationally on an annual basis. Potatoes are by far the principal site (87 %, followed by tomatoes (8 %), and cotton (5 %). It is of special note that methamidophos is a degradate of another organophosphate pesticide, acephate. In the Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) chapter for acephate it was estimated that, in soil, 0. 77 pounds of methamidophos results from each pound of acephate applied. Estimates for aerobic aquatic conditions were not available. Because Estimted Environmental Concentrations (EECs) and Risk Quotients (RQs) were not determined for methamidophos as a degradate in water, this review will center on the features associated with direct application of methamidophos, and not those features associated with methamidophos from acephate degradation. The high solubility of acephate and methamidophos suggests that its degredates would not accumulate significantly in typical salmon and steelhead habitat. Registered formulations include the Technical Grade for manufacturing use, and for end use, a 40 % emulsifiable concentrate. Application methods include chemigation (potatoes only), and high and low volume spray. Aircraft, ground sprayers, and sprinkler techniques can be used.

Four of these experimental hybrids (TEX- 298, TEX- 310, TEX- 315 and TEX- 316) were assessed for resistance to the South American <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> Tuta absoluta, and were shown to possess higher degrees of pest resistance than the current commercial hybrid checks...|$|E
40|$|A agricultura orgânica no Brasil cresce a taxas superiores a 30 % ao ano, devido principalmente à maior conscientização dos consumidores que buscam alimentos saudáveis, livres de resíduos químicos e biológicos. Dentre as hortaliças cultivadas em sistema orgânico, o tomate constitui grande desafio para os produtores devido à inexistência de recomendações de manejo {{cultural}} e de cultivares desenvolvidas específicas para esse sistema de cultivo. Diante disso, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o desempenho de cultivares de tomate sob sistema orgânico, em ambiente protegido. O experimento foi conduzido de maio a outubro de 2004 em campo, no município de Araraquara-SP. O delineamento experimental adotado foi blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições e oito tratamentos (cultivares Avalon, Colibri, HTX- 5415, HTX- 8027, Sahel, San Marzano, San Vito e Jane). As plantas foram conduzidas em fileiras duplas, com duas hastes por planta no espaçamento de 0, 8 m entre linhas e 0, 6 m entre plantas (cerca de 20. 000 plantas ha- 1), sem poda apical. O híbrido Sahel destacou-se com o melhor desempenho para rendimento comercial. A traça-do-tomateiro se revelou como fator limitante à produção de tomate em sistema orgânico, sendo responsável, em média, por 17 % de danos nos frutos colhidos das oito cultivares que foram avaliadas. Organic {{agriculture in}} Brazil {{has been increasing}} about 30 % per year {{over the last few}} years, since consumers are seeking for healthier foods, i. e. nutritious and free of pesticide residues. Among organically grown vegetable crops, tomato is an attractive economic opportunity for growers. However, the lack of information about management practices and adapted cultivars to organic production systems under protected cultivation are pointed out as important constraints that prevents this activity to expand. This work aimed at evaluating the performance of indeterminate tomato cultivars in organic management systems in unheated plastic greenhouse. In both experiments tomato plants were staked. Plant spacing was 1. 5 m between rows and 0. 35 m between plants. They were planted in double line and spaced 0. 8 m between lines and 0. 6 m between plants (about 20, 000 plants ha- 1). The experiment was set up in a randomized complete block design, with four replications and eight treatments (cultivars: Avalon, Colibri, HTX- 5415, HTX- 8027, Sahel, San Marzano, San Vito, and Jane). Sahel hybrid exhibited an outstanding performance for marketable yield under organic cultivation. <b>Tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> (Tuta absoluta) was a serious limiting pest for organically grown tomatoes, responding for 17 % of damage in the fruits harvested from the evaluated cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Uma das estratégias do melhoramento do tomateiro, no Brasil, visando à resistência a pragas, tem sido a utilização de aleloquímicos presentes nos folíolos. Objetivou-se no presente trabalho, estudar os níveis de resistência a dois artrópodos-pragas [traça do tomateiro (Tuta absoluta) e ácaros (Tetranychus evansi) ], em genótipos previamente selecionados com base apenas no seu teor foliar de acilaçúcares. Foram selecionadas 11 plantas contrastantes quanto aos níveis de acilaçúcares nos folíolos, de uma população F 3 RC 2, derivada do cruzamento interespecífico Lycopersicon esculentum Mill 'TOM- 584 ' x Lycopersicon pennellii (Correll) D'Arcy 'LA- 716 '. Esses genótipos, juntamente com os genitores TOM- 584 e LA- 716, foram submetidos a ensaios de repelência/resistência a artrópodos-pragas. No teste de repelência ao ácaro T. evansi, as plantas com altos teores de acilaçúcares se comportaram de forma semelhante ao genitor resistente LA- 716. As {{magnitudes}} das correlações foram negativas e significativas, confirmando assim a associação entre altos teores do aleloquímico e a resistência (repelência) ao ácaro, avaliada pela distância percorrida. No ensaio realizado com a traça do tomateiro, os genótipos foram avaliados para danos nas plantas e lesões nos folíolos. Os genótipos contendo alto teor de acilaçúcares, demonstraram bons níveis de resistência a Tuta absoluta, não diferindo significativamente do acesso selvagem LA- 716. Em todas as épocas de avaliação, os teores de acilaçúcares mostraram-se alta e negativamente correlacionados com os níveis de dano causados pela traça. Os resultados obtidos comprovaram a eficiência da seleção de genótipos de tomateiro com elevados teores de acilaçúcares nos folíolos, visando à resistência a artrópodos-praga. Selection {{for high}} foliar levels of allelochemicals {{has been proposed}} as a suitable strategy for breeding tomatoes for arthropod pest resistance. In the Lycopersicon pennellii (Correll) D'Arcy accession LA- 716, acylsugars exsudated by type IV glandular trichomes present in all aerial parts of the plant reportedly mediate resistance to arthropod pests. This paper intended to study the levels of resistance to two arthropod pests, the South American <b>tomato</b> <b>pinworm</b> (Tuta absoluta) and spider mites (Tetranychus evansi) in tomato genotypes selected {{solely on the basis}} of their foliar acylsugar contents. Eleven plants with contrasting acylsugar contents were selected from population F 3 BC 2 derived from the interespecific cross Lycopersicon esculentum 'TOM- 584 'x Lycopersicon pennellii 'LA- 716 '. These genotypes were used in tests for resistance/ repellence to the arthropod pests, along with parental checks TOM- 584 and LA- 716. In Tetranychus spp. mite repellence tests, plants selected for high acylsugar contents behaved similarly to the resistant parent LA- 716. Negative and significative correlations between acylsugar contents and distances travelled by the mites onto the leaflet surface indicated an association between the allelochemical and the levels of mite repellence. In the assay with the South American pinworm, these genotypes were evaluated for leaflet lesion type and overall plant damage. The high acylsugar genotypes had good levels of insect resistance, similar to those found in LA- 716. In all the evaluation date, acylsugars levels were highly and negatively correlated with pinworm damage. The results indicated that selection for high acylsugar contents was effective in increasing the levels of arthropod resistance of tomato genotypes...|$|E
