The methodology focuses on biotransformations using twoapproaches: an oxygenation approach (i. e. oxygenation ofterpene hydrocarbons by cell cultures) and an esterificationapproach (i. e. lipase-catalysed transesterification of vinylacetate with <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols,</b> and a further fractionation ofthe TMP-turpentine). The main constituents of the turpentine, a-pinene, b-pineneand limonene, were subjected to a P. abies suspension culture. Allylic oxidation formed the major products for α-pineneand β-pinene, which were further oxidised to theirrespective aldehyde or ketone. One of the minor products froma-pinene, cis-verbenol, was not only transformed into verbenonebut also isomerised to trans-verbenol. Limonene gavelimonene-(1, 2) -epoxide as the major product. Fractionation of monoterpenes is accomplished throughphysical separation methods, chromatography and distillation,and lipase-catalysed transesterification of vinyl acetate withterpene alcohols. The esters of myrtenol and trans-pinocarveolwere separated from the more slowly reacting alcohols such asborneol and carveol by use {{of a combination of}} the Mucor mieheilipase and Candida antarctica lipase A as catalysts. Furthermore, the non-reacting tertiary <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols</b> wereseparated from the reacting alcohols in a single step byCandida antarctica lipase A.

To verify {{the effect of the}} water mass fraction in the solvent and the linalool mass fraction in the terpene phase on the distribution coefficients of the essential oil compounds, nonlinear regression analyses were performed, obtaining mathematical models with correlation coefficient values higher than 0. 99. The results show that as the water content in the solvent phase increased, the kappa value decreased, regardless of the type of compound studied. Conversely, as the linalool content increased, the distribution coefficients of hydrocarbon terpene and ester also increased. However, the linalool distribution coefficient values were negatively affected when the <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohol</b> content increased in the terpene phase.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 This work set out {{to examine}} the {{potential}} contribution of five aliphatic lactones, γ-nonalactone, γ-decalactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-decalactone and δ-dodecalactone to stone fruit aroma in beer. This work consists of three related studies; lactone olfaction thresholds, additive/synergistic aroma effects and a gas-chromatography-mass-spectrophometry method of analysis. First was the determination of these lactone's thresholds in an unhopped pale ale beer base. This same base {{was used for the}} second investigation, which assessed the influence of these lactones on overall fruit aroma in combination with hop-derived esters, a <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohol</b> and a norisoprenoid in descriptive analysis. Lastly, the third body of work consisted of developing a simple and accessible instrumental method for the detection of lactones in a beer matrix. The olfaction detection threshold of five aliphatic lactones were determined in an unhopped pale ale using the ASTM E 679 "best estimate threshold" standard methodology. Twenty-five to twenty-nine panelists assessed the sets of 3 -alternative forced choice tests and the group’s geometric mean calculated from each panelist's individual threshold served as the olfaction detection threshold in this base. The calculated thresholds in unhopped pale ale were above published thresholds previously reported in water and ranged from 238 - 750 μg/L. To assess the additive or synergistic effects of lactones (γ-nona and deca lactone, and δ-decalactone) in combination with hop-derived esters (ethyl 2 - and ethyl 3 -methylbutanoate) and oxygenated terpenes (linalool and β-damascenone) descriptive analysis was performed with a trained panel with a final ballot possessing stone fruit/peach, coconut/oily, red berry and melon plus overall fruity intensity as descriptors. All compounds were spiked into unhopped pale ale at published and commercially realistic levels detected in beers. Lactones individually yielded low average scores in all categories and only significantly differed from the base on coconut/oily and overall intensity. However, when mixed with ethyl esters and oxygenated terpenes, overall fruity intensity significantly increased, as did the stone fruit/peach descriptor. The development of the Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometery (GC-MS) method for lactones in a beer matrix was adapted from multiple methods developed for the detection of lactones in wine. A model system (5...|$|E
40|$|Terpenes and terpenoids make {{up one of}} {{the largest}} and most {{structurally}} diverse families of natural products with known compounds numbering in the tens of thousands. A significant proportion of terpenoids are secondary metabolites, which display a wide range of biological activities, and consequently many have found uses as therapeutic drugs, most notably paclitaxel, the anti-cancer agent; and artemisinin, a key drug in anti-malarial therapies. Due to the challenges in synthesising these highly complex compounds in satisfactory yields the majority of the supply of these drugs is still extracted from natural sources or produced semi-synthetically from naturally extracted compounds. Terpene synthases convert the linear isoprenyl diphosphates, precursors of all terpenoids, into complex hydrocarbon skeletons, which are often naturally further derivatised by P 450 cytochromes. Recently there have been advances in exploiting terpene synthases for the production of terpenoid precursors, but despite these advances selectively derivatising the hydrocarbon skeleton remains the major barrier to the conversion of these skeletons to therapeutically viable compounds. This thesis focuses on exploring methods of generating simple terpenoids from terpene synthases. The project is divided into two parts both designed to investigate methods of generating simple terpenoids. The first part focuses on germacradien- 4 -ol synthase (GdolS), a recently discovered bacterial sesquiterpene synthase, which incorporates water in the cyclisation cascade to generate a single <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohol.</b> This enzyme was characterised and the mechanism probed using substrate analogues and single-point mutations to elucidate how GdolS is able to incorporate water into its product while still protecting the highly reactive carbocation intermediates. Our data indicated that germacradien- 4 -ol synthase catalyses the loss of the diphosphate group and ring closure in a stepwise manner, followed by a 1, 3 -hydride shift to generate a long-lived allylic-carbocation intermediate. We propose this carbocation is then quenched by water ingress into the active site due to loop movement. The second part of the project involved the synthesis of a range of farnesyl diphosphate analogues designed to offer means of trapping carbocation intermediates in the catalysis by a range of sesquiterpene synthases. These analogues were primarily epoxy-FDPs, designed to produce simple terpenoids with hydroxy- and epoxy-functionalities. While a number of the prepared analogues were turned over by the tested sesquiterpene synthases two, 10, 11 -epoxy-FDP and 10 -hydroxy- 11 -ene-FDP, were able to intercept the farnesyl cation upon loss of the diphosphate group, to generate a novel macrocyclic ether...|$|E

By using cell-free extracts, the 14 C from MVA- 1 - 14 C {{was recovered}} as 14 CO 2, while that from MVA- 2 - 14 C was recovered as neutral terpenes, acid-hydrolyzable terpenes, or 14 CO 2. Also, under optimal incubation conditions, 12. 8 nanomoles R-MVA- 2 - 14 C {{was incorporated into}} neutral terpenes per milligram fresh weight per hour. In contrast, excised shoots incorporated only 0. 58 nanomoles R-MVA- 2 - 14 C per mg fresh weight per hour. Labeled products identified from the cell-free system were squalene, farnesol, geranylgeraniol, and compounds that are converted to farnesol and geranylgeraniol after alkaline hydrolysis. Squalene and a 4, 4 -dimethylsterol were identified as products from excised shoots but not the <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols</b> or the alkaline-hydrolyzable compounds...|$|R

Here, we present our progress {{in the field of}} the dehydration reaction, using various rhenium-based catalysts, with rhenium(VII) oxide as the most active catalyst. A wide range of allylic, aliphatic, and homoallylic alcohols have been used as substrates under relatively mild conditions (100 – 150 °C, 0. 5 mol % catalyst loading, technical toluene, ambient atmosphere) as well as various biobased <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Furthermore, we have applied our protocol to tea tree oil as a proof of concept for the catalytic upgrading of essential oils. The reactivity and selectivity of rhenium(VII) oxide is compared with a classical acid catalyst; sulfuric acid; and solid acid catalysts, such as acid resins, zeolites, and mesoporous materials. It was found that rhenium(VII) oxide surpasses all these catalysts in both activity and selectivity and also shows enduring activity after seven recycling runs...|$|R
