5|$|Due to her honesty, Marge {{does not}} sell any homes. Hutz informs {{her to use}} more {{positive}} descriptions when selling the houses, and also informs Marge if she does not sell {{a house in the}} first week, she will be fired. Marge tries <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> truth, but fails as she just cannot lie to others. Marge does not disclose the entire truth of the house she sells to Ned Flanders and his family, which had been the site of a multiple homicide. The Flanders purchase the house and bid farewell to the Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{gets into}} a fight with Nelson Muntz, the school bully, while {{defending}} Lisa and the cupcakes that she baked for Miss. Hoover's birthday party. Nelson beats up Bart after school and warns him to expect the same treatment the following day. At home, Marge consoles and encourages Bart to reason with Nelson. Homer urges Bart <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> rules and fight dirty. Taking Homer's advice, Bart does so, but is beaten up again. Bart turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa Simpson, who introduces Bart to Herman, the crazed one-armed proprietor of an army surplus store. He instructs Bart on military tactics, then Bart declares war on Nelson and his sidekicks.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
50|$|To ask for {{the turn}} on the haunches, the rider must {{coordinate}} several aids at once. The outside leg prevents the hindquarters from swinging out, the outside rein maintains a correct <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside, and helps to regulate the driving aids, telling the horse to turn rather than walk forward. The inside leg asks <b>the</b> horse <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inside, pushes the energy into the outside aids, and keeps {{the activity of the}} hindquarters. The inside seatbone should be engaged, again to ask <b>the</b> horse <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> in <b>the</b> direction of the turn, and the inside rein should help lead the forehand around and also remind <b>the</b> horse <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> in <b>the</b> direction of the turn.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> trajectory of a beam of ions, {{and the amount of}} deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of China {{was known to}} Roman cartographers, but their understanding of it was less certain. Ptolemy's 2nd-century AD Geography separates the Land of Silk (Serica) {{at the end of}} the overland Silk Road from the land of the Qin (Sinae) reached by sea. The Sinae are placed on the northern shore of the Great Gulf (Magnus Sinus) east of the Golden Peninsula (Aurea Chersonesus, Malay Peninsula). Their chief port, Cattigara, seems to have been in the lower Mekong Delta. The Great Gulf served as a combined Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea, as Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy's belief that the Indian Ocean was an inland sea caused them <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> Cambodian coast south beyond the equator before turning west to join southern Libya (Africa). Much of this is given as unknown lands, but the north-eastern area is placed under the Sinae.|$|E
5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
50|$|Larssen {{sheet piling}} {{is a kind}} of sheet piling {{retaining}} wall. Segments with indented profiles (troughs) interlock to form a wall with alternating indents and outdents. The troughs increase resistance <b>to</b> <b>bending.</b> <b>The</b> segments are typically made of steel or another metal.|$|R

5|$|Kaecilius {{uses the}} stolen pages {{to contact the}} {{powerful}} Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off {{with the help of}} the Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive. Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One's long life is due to her drawing power from the Dark Dimension. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension irresistibly engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then creates an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment of time. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he leave Earth and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the time loop.|$|E
5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E
25|$|Meningitis (inflammation of {{the lining}} of the brain) occurs in 3-26% of cases. Symptoms may include {{headache}} and nuchal rigidity (being unable <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> head forward). It may be acute or chronic.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{consequences}} of general relativity is that massive objects (such as a cluster of galaxies) lying between a more distant source (such as a quasar) and an observer should act as a lens <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> light from this source. The more massive an object, the more lensing is observed.|$|E

25|$|The leg in {{the initial}} {{position}} bends very slightly at the knees, and then kicks the lower leg and the foot downwards similar to kicking a football. The legs may be bent inward (or occasionally outward) slightly. After the kick, the straight leg moves back up. A frequent mistake of beginners is <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> legs too much or to kick too much out of the water.|$|E
25|$|The secret police, Securitate, {{had become}} so omnipresent that it made Romania {{essentially}} a police state. Free speech was limited and opinions that did not favor the Communist Party were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made organised dissent nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on this sense that everyone was being watched {{to make it easier}} <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> people to the Party's will. Even by Soviet-bloc standards, the Securitate was exceptionally brutal.|$|E
25|$|Anticipation is used {{to prepare}} the {{audience}} for an action, {{and to make the}} action appear more realistic. A dancer jumping off the floor has <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> knees first; a golfer making a swing has to swing the club back first. The technique can also be used for less physical actions, such as a character looking off-screen to anticipate someone's arrival, or attention focusing on an object that a character is about to pick up.|$|E

25|$|The {{job of the}} big magnet is <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> {{paths of}} {{particles}} emerging from high-energy collisions in the LHC. The more momentum a particle has the less its path is curved by the magnetic field, so tracing its path gives a measure of momentum. CMS began {{with the aim of}} having the strongest magnet possible because a higher strength field bends paths more and, combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even high-energy particles.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Loops Another {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement is <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested toroidal surfaces. The most highly developed system {{of this type}} is the tokamak, with the stellarator being next most advanced, followed by the Reversed field pinch. Compact toroids, especially the Field-Reversed Configuration and the spheromak, attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a simply connected (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.|$|E
25|$|In {{some common}} posets {{such as the}} face lattice of a convex polytope {{there is a natural}} grading by dimension, which if used as rank {{function}} would give the minimal element, the empty face, rank –1. In such cases it might be convenient <b>to</b> <b>bend</b> <b>the</b> definition stated above by adjoining the value –1 to the set of values allowed for the rank function. Allowing arbitrary integers as rank would however give a fundamentally different notion; for instance the existence of a minimal element would no longer be assured.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Damage {{initiation}} {{and evolution}} in SCS- 6 /Timetal 21 S with quasi-isotropic layup loaded under quasi-static and dynamic bending is investigated.
