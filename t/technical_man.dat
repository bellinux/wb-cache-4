On the other hand the main function is to make the individual provide financial income and with this be useful to society at social and economic ways. Vocational and technical education has great affection power at development of country's economy with human labor qualities. For this reason, in the developed countries vocational and technical education has special importance. In the developed countries; for more strong economy and more rapid social development, more qualified work labor is need to be provided. With this purpose, an effort is made to develop vocational and technical education. In Turkey, vocational schools {{are one of the most}} important education institutions at raising qualified human power. It is aimed the vocational school students to have more theoretical knowledge than <b>technical</b> <b>man,</b> and more practice ability than engineers by graduating with technician title. The cooperation between university and industry has importance at vocational school graduates having these abilities. In the education programs; students must continue a part of their education at industrial companies for 30 working days duration. This process is named as internship and it is necessary for the students to graduate. Students can find various abilities during the period where they were at the companies. In this study; it is aimed to analyze the expectations from internship education, and the gained knowledge and abilities of Marmara University Vocational School of Technical Sciences students. According to this, an answer is searched to the question “What kind of knowledge and abilities do the vocational school students gain during the internship period?” The universe of this study is the students studying at Marmara University Vocational School of Technical Sciences programs.

40|$|In Punjab, the {{continuous}} floods {{in the last}} six years especially in 2010 and 2014, due to climatic and non-climatic reasons, have exposed physical, socio-economic, and environmental vulnerabilities. The flood disaster management in Punjab is primarily focused on rescue, relief, and dependence of structural measures. The assessment of vulnerability is limited to district level (in form of mapping) which is incapable of identifying essential socio-economic drivers of vulnerability and local ability to cope and adapt. The mega flood of 2010 inflicted several changes in government structure and within communities. This research study assessed the vulnerability and capacity of flood affected communities as well as fluctuation in their vulnerability and capacity by analyzing planned and unplanned post flood responses. The study also determined the role of spatial planning in reducing flood vulnerabilities. To conduct the study, a vulnerability assessment framework was modified from sustainable livelihood and BBC framework. Qualitative and quantitative analysis and their triangulation were conducted to apprehend the pertaining issues. Interviews with officials of disaster management and spatial planning institutes were conducted to analyze changes after 2010 flood and government interventions. Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) for two flood events (2010 and 2014) and household survey provided the vulnerability and capacity assessment of four flood affected communities in two severely affected districts (Jhang and Muzaffargarh) of Punjab. The results indicated that government interventions were limited to financial aid and early warning. These measures remained victim to political biasness, mismanagement, and lack of coordination and communication between departments. Other formal changes (legislation, policies, plans etc.) seemed to be less effective due to top-down approach, lack of <b>technical</b> <b>man</b> power; disaster management knowledge and financial constraints. Spatial planning appeared ineffective in mitigating flood risk as it was limited to urban areas and deficient incorporation of DRR measures in development plans. The results of PRA and household survey indicated that vulnerability of immovable assets increased or remained the same after 2014 flood disaster, but reduced significantly for moveable assets. Complex relationships existed within and between various dimensions of vulnerability that fluctuated vulnerability of related elements and factors. These relationships demonstrated that lack of physical infrastructure and awareness were the key drivers of vulnerability in Punjab...|$|E

40|$|The {{only option}} for the poor ? Cue: Organic farming is often {{associated}} with expensive, high quality foods sold to wealthy consumers or exported to European markets. But, as this next report shows, organic compost or manure is sometimes the only fertilizer available to poor farmers. The report comes from Malawi, one of several countries in southern Africa that has in recent months and years experienced severe food shortages. These have been partly caused by erratic rainfall and little use of farming inputs by poor farmers. In response, the Malawi government has undertaken a programme to encourage the use of organic fertilizer. Benedicto Thawe, of the organisation PROSCARP spoke to Excello Zidana about the benefits and problems associated with organic fertilizer use, and how poor farmers have been responding to the government?s advice. IN:		?For the past two years ? OUT:		? even apply either of these. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 26 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Benedicto Thawe, on the benefits of organic fertilizer for poor farmers in Malawi. Transcript Thawe	For the past two years we have really seen the declining trend of food production in this country, and one of the major causes has been actually failure of our rural masses to acquire some inorganic fertilizers for their production. And because of this the government thought of actually promoting the use of organic farming, and in this case we have mounted some campaigns whereby farmers are advised or encouraged to use organic manure as an alternative source for plant nutrients. Zidana	What are the advantages of organic farming over inorganic chemicals or fertilizers? Thawe	The most important one is its ability to improve the soil structure. This is very important, especially these days when you talk of unpredictable weather, when {{you have a lot of}} dry spells during the season, and when you use organic fertilizers, whether in the form of compost or khola manure, you actually improve the soil structure, and also it helps in the retention of soil moisture, when you have this situation of erratic rains. Another advantage is it supports living micro-organisms in the soil which are very crucial for crop productivity. It also provides other micro-nutrients which are not even available in these inorganic fertilizers. Most of our fertilizers which are readily available in the market, they only supply N, P, K nutrients, but when you use these organic fertilizers, you have got these other trace elements which are most crucial for proper development for any crop. Zidana	When somebody talks of crop rotation, mixed farming, are these part of organic farming? Thawe	In a way you would say yes, it is a form of organic farming, because actually in these sort of farming systems, what you are saying is, farmers should learn to recycle the crop residues back into the soil. And you know, each crop has got different nutrient content within itself, so when you use different form of crops, be it legumes or cereals, when you turn it and you get these things back into the soil you also promote humus build up within the soil. Zidana	What are some of the problems or difficulties associated with organic farming? Thawe	Yes of course, each technology has got its own disadvantages or demerits. For example, when it comes to compost making, you really need water supply, but you see most of our farming communities have got difficulties in getting this water. So one of the major problems we have is water availability for this compost making. But also, farmers have expressed concern that they don?t have enough materials in carrying these manures or organic fertilizers to their fields. You might find that a farmer has got a khola which is a little bit distant to his field, so he needs some ox-carts, wheelbarrows, to enable him to carry it from the khola to the field. Zidana	How has been the response from the farmers? Thawe	Yes, this year because of, possibly the situation we have had last year of very low production of maize in particular, this year I think we have seen very positive response from the farming communities. A lot of farmers have taken it up, and we expect this year to have a very good acreage, to be applied under organic manure, both from compost and khola manure. Zidana	You yourself, as a <b>technical</b> <b>man,</b> do you really think that organic farming can help poor farmers in Malawi? Thawe	Of course we don?t have any other alternative at present. That is the only answer we have at the moment. But of course we don?t completely deny them from getting some inorganic fertilizers. If a farmer can get a little inorganic fertilizer, and he combines it with organic fertilizer, that is even much better, because the response when you combine both is even much better. But for our current situation, a farmer is better off when he can go for organic fertilizers compared with the one who can not even apply either of these. End of track. Organic fertilizer may be the only type available to poor farmers, but it can help to restore their land and keep their crops alive during drought. The report comes from Malawi...|$|E
40|$|Feed and {{fodder for}} {{livestock}} Cue: Making hay {{is a vital}} activity for many smallscale livestock farmers. Hay is cut grass or legumes which have been dried and stored, {{so that they can}} be used as feed when other sources of food or pasture are not available. The grass is harvested at times when it is abundant, and then stored. The drying process is very important when making hay, because it needs to keep for a long time. If the hay is not completely dry, then moisture will attract fungus and bacteria, and the hay will become poisonous. In this interview, Excello Zidana speaks to Baxter Zimba of the Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development in Malawi. He asks Mr Zimba?s advice on how to make hay, and how to make sure that it is dry enough to be safe for use as livestock fodder. He beings by explaining that there are no rules to the art of making hay, but there is the need to ?strike a balance?. IN:	?We have to realise that? OUT:	?which they can supplement. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Baxter Zimba speaking to Excello Zidana in Malawi. Do you know how to ?strike the balance?? What is the best time for making hay in your area? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Zimba	We have to realise that when the grass is too small and nutritive value is also in small quantities but when it is also too old, then the nutritive value also goes down. So we have to strike a balance. The balance is if the type of forage we are talking about or grass is almost getting ripe, that is the time when we can cut it down and preserve it. Zidana	So we should be saying that the feed that has high nutritive value is good for maximising animal products like milk. How should drying of feeds be done to achieve this? Zimba	The moisture content in the feed is reduced to a point where it is not being attacked by microbes for fear that it can get rotten. You can cut it down into small pieces, you can add some additives to make sure that the fermentation goes faster and it gets preserved. Zidana	And obviously when this process is taking place temperatures, I am talking of ideal temperatures, need to be considered. But now if you look at the prices for the temperature meters are expensive, how can smallscale farmers test the temperatures when they are doing this process? Zimba	People from experience, from the very old days, they know when it is hot, they know when it is cold, and so on. They know that if you ensile the green material and there is no air that goes in there the temperatures will go high. And when you are conserving silage the type of temperature that will be found there will not be a normal ambient temperature it will be above the room temperature. There is a saying that make hay while? while the sun is shining. Why that is being said is because hay making can only be successful when it is sun shining and the weather is dry and that when they have cut the grass and they have to dry it, make sure that no water or rains fall on it, they should remove it immediately to tripods. We call them tripods, these are very simple structures which they can use to dry off there. So that even when it rains during the night or the following day they will still get on the hang and then they will still get dry because the idea is to reduce the moisture content in that product so that the microbes are not able to decompose it. Zidana	The forage that is cut and left in the moist conditions go mouldy and mouldy forages are unpalatable and even dangerous to livestock due to mycotoxin poisoning. Is there any technique for deciding the best time and even the season when harvesting can be done to prevent this? Zimba	If it is now getting mature you are forced, you have to preserve at that time so that you strike a balance on the amount of fodder and the amount of nutrients available in the product. Zidana	Now let?s come to storage, when can storage be done and what is the ideal moisture content to consider when storing the dried feed and fodder? Zimba	Where we talk of green materials conserved like silage and so on you have to use the pits, these are simple dug-up structures and then after you have ensiled it you have removed the air, you have removed some microbes that means you are sure enough that the material is going to be conserved. So you ensile it, in other words you make sure you seal it completely, you cut off the air because the air sometimes you have problems of bacteria which spoil our material like silage. Zidana	As a <b>technical</b> <b>man,</b> now can you provide any advice to the livestock farmers and even those who have taken up preservation or conservation of feed as business on how they can make feeds that has high nutritive value? Zimba	We are supposed to advise our farmers to make sure that they supplement, they also have to conserve either types of feed materials. In other words, during the rainy season or even during the dry season, they have to pile up some other types of ingredients, like for instance maize bran, the rice bran and so on, which they can supplement.

This knowledge needs to be applied to the design of future platforms.

The six volumes together leave the eager reader with the impression of Dutch technical achievement totally, or almost totally, dependent on commercial entrepreneurship and on national competition under unfavourable market conditions. This is not the complete picture. Dutch shipbuilding and even the construction of warship steam engines remained in the forefront. The demands of the navy and later those of the emerging shipping companies were instrumental in preventing a big gap with British marine technology. Dredging, bridge construction and hydraulic engineering in general, were state of the art activities. Furthermore the technological basis for the nowadays successful food industries of the Netherlands was laid in the nineteenth century. Many chapters of the series pay tribute to the role of the commercially oriented entrepreneur in the introduction of steam power and other technical equipment. Engineers remain in the background, with the exception of some navy engineers and those working in public service on the construction of canals, dykes, railroads, and bridges. The question of their societal role in creating networks and platforms for technical modernization remains unanswered. This is especially regrettable for readers with an engineering background, but it does not affect the very positive judgement on the contribution of this series to a better understanding of the societal role of technology in the previous century...|$|R
