5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, {{close to the}} body; it is not <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> the shoulder feathers {{as in many other}} species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.|$|E
5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and hind legs remaining <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{reef knot}} is {{commonly}} taught as left over right, <b>tuck</b> <b>under</b> then right over left, <b>tuck</b> <b>under.</b> The granny knot {{is the first}} step repeated twice, left over right, <b>tuck</b> <b>under.</b> This is a very common mistake made by people learning to tie a reef knot.|$|R

5|$|The {{other three}} songs on Desolate North one was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home. He has said how this was {{the most difficult part of}} the recording. As it happened, Anderson misplaced his microphone stand and so recorded those two songs with the microphone <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> his chin. Despite the hindrance, Anderson claimed that the microphone picked up everything, and he was happy with the result.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> his arm.|$|E
50|$|However, a {{top sheet}} {{has its own}} advantages. First, a tucked-in top sheet can provide a {{comfortable}} feeling of snugness that duvets cannot, as duvets are not usually large enough to <b>tuck</b> <b>under</b> the mattress. Second, top sheets allow {{a wider range of}} blanket choices besides duvets, such as quilts.|$|R
5000|$|Cross {{over the}} immobilized {{other end of}} the rope, then cross back <b>tucking</b> <b>under</b> the {{crossing}} point of step 3.2 (of the immobilized other end, and the part between the two turns), (option 2 : this last tuck with a bight instead of the end as an end-side-slip for the final knot).|$|R
50|$|In 1956, IMI {{developed}} a downward-folding twin-strut metal stock with two swiveling sections that <b>tucks</b> <b>under</b> {{the rear of}} the receiver. The Mini Uzi has a forward-folding single-strut metal stock that is actually an inch longer than the Uzi's. Its buttplate {{can be used as a}} foregrip when stowed. The Micro Uzi has a similar model.|$|R

25|$|Mitsubishi Motors {{started selling}} its i MiEV, the all-electric mini-car with a {{lithium-ion}} battery pack <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> its floor, to retail {{customers in the}} summer 2009, a year ahead of schedule. The automaker had initially planned to start leasing the minicar-based vehicle to businesses and municipalities in the summer 2009 and to wait until 2010 for the retail launch. It has also announced its plans to offer five other e-drive vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The T-shirt {{evolved from}} {{undergarments}} {{used in the}} 19th century. First, the one-piece union suit underwear was cut into separate top and bottom garments, with the top long enough to <b>tuck</b> <b>under</b> the waistband of the bottoms. With and without buttons, they were adopted by miners and stevedores during the late 19th century as a convenient covering for hot environments.|$|R
50|$|For folding, {{the rear}} {{suspension}} <b>tucks</b> <b>under</b> the frame, the front suspension is unclipped and hinges {{back under the}} frame, and the seat post is collapsed. Lastly the handlebars hinge downward. The front wheel can be left unfolded if the package is to be wheeled, for example when boarding public transport. Folding is relatively more complicated than for a Brompton and takes slightly longer.|$|R
50|$|The Manitoba tuck {{is a form}} of {{slide in}} curling. A <b>tuck</b> <b>under</b> is when the curler's front toe is {{the only part of the}} slider that comes into contact with the ice. The slide is used almost {{exclusively}} by curlers from the province of Manitoba though tuck curlers are also found in nearby regions of Saskatchewan and the US state of North Dakota.|$|R
25|$|A bird volant {{faces the}} dexter with its wings spread in flight (usually shown addorsed and elevated) and its legs <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> its body. Volant En Arrière {{is when the}} bird is shown from a {{top-down}} perspective with the head facing straight ahead, its back to the viewer, and the wings spread in flight (usually shown displayed and inverted). A bird volant is considered in bend ("diagonal") as it is flying from the lower sinister to the upper dexter of the field.|$|E
25|$|A pointe shoe employs two fabric {{ribbons and}} an elastic band to secure {{it to the}} foot. Most {{of the work of}} {{securing}} shoes to feet is done by the ribbons. The two ribbons wrap around the dancer's ankle in opposite directions, overlapping one another so as to form a cross at the front. The ends are then tied together in a knot, which is then <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> the ribbon {{on the inside of the}} ankle to hide it from view. The elastic band—which traverses the front of the ankle below the ribbons—keeps the heel of the shoe in place against the foot when the dancer is en pointe.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Land Rover had {{launched}} the Discovery its Range Rover-based family 4×4 that quickly became Europe's top-selling 4×4. One {{of the key}} reasons for its success was its ground-breaking turbodiesel engine. The 200Tdi {{was one of the}} first mass-produced small-capacity (i.e., not a lorry engine) direct-injection diesels, with the attendant improvements in power and efficiency that system brings. Developed under the codename Gemini, the 200Tdi was planned from the start to be used on all Land Rover's products. For production reasons, it had to be machined on the existing machinery, so used the same block and crankshaft as the existing 2.5-litre diesel engines. It also used many ancillary parts used on the older engines. However, it was a true break with the past. An aluminium alloy cylinder head reduced weight and noise, a new Bosch injection system gave improved running characteristics and better starting performance. An intercooler boosted power and efficiency further. Lessons learnt from the Diesel Turbo were included, such as the fitment of an inertial separator in the breather system to remove oil before crankcase gases were returned to the air intake. Initially turbocharged and naturally aspirated diesel versions and a carburettor-fed petrol version were to be produced. The direct-injection system meant that only machining of the injector sockets was needed to allow the fitment of spark plugs. However, the performance and economy of the turbodiesel version was such that the other variants were not produced. The 200Tdi was launched in the Discovery in 1989. It was then fitted to the utility Land Rover (renamed the Defender) in late 1990. For this application the engine was slightly de-tuned and, whilst in the Discovery the 200Tdi used all-new components, packaging restraints in the Defender meant that the 200Tdi in this role shared many exterior parts (such as the timing belt system and case) with the Diesel Turbo. Most obviously the turbocharger was retained in the Diesel Turbo's high mounting position on top of the manifolds in the Defender, rather than being <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> the manifolds in the original Discovery version. In 1992 the engine was fitted to the Range Rover. Although the older petrol and naturally aspirated diesel units were theoretically still available, the 200Tdi had better performance and economy than any of them, and so dominated the sales figures. It is still highly regarded by Land Rover enthusiasts and has established itself as a powerful and long-lived unit that with proper maintenance can exceed 300,000 miles of use. The engine's commonality with the older models makes it a popular choice for installation in older Land Rovers. This is done both in original form or with the turbo removed (when the engine becomes known to enthusiasts as a 200Di) in order to keep the power/torque output within the limits of a Series Land Rover's gearbox and for greater ease of conversion. The turbocharged version may also be installed with or without the intercooler.|$|E

500|$|Egg-laying {{starts in}} April in more southerly colonies but seldom occurs before June in Greenland. The female lays a single white egg each year {{but if this}} is lost early in the {{breeding}} season, another might be produced. Synchronous laying of eggs is found in Atlantic puffins in adjacent burrows. The egg is large compared {{to the size of the}} bird, averaging [...] long by [...] wide and weighing about [...] The white shell is usually devoid of markings but soon becomes soiled with mud. The incubation responsibilities are shared by both parents. They each have two feather-free brood patches on their undersides where an enhanced blood supply provides heat for the egg. The parent on incubation duty in the dark nest chamber spends much of its time asleep with its head <b>tucked</b> <b>under</b> its wing, occasionally emerging from the tunnel to flap dust out of its feathers or take a short flight down to the sea.|$|E
