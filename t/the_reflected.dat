5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> lamina. <b>The</b> <b>reflected</b> lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. <b>The</b> <b>reflected</b> lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|LIDAR {{comprises}} firing lasers at relevant {{portions of}} the atmosphere where light is backscattered. By analyzing <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> laser beam for Doppler shifts, wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated. The thermal structure, diurnal/semi-diurnal tides, and seasonal variations in the mesopause region may thus be studied. This is a valuable faculty for meteorologists and climatologists, as these properties can be significant.|$|E

50|$|The {{issue of}} the {{photoswitch}} that <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> member may be drastically lowered due to dewing and clouding of <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface due {{to a change in}} the ambient temperature. The dew on <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface causes a random reflection. In order to avoid the clouding of <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface, it has been proposed to apply silicon or the like to the surface of <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> member. This countermeasure, however, cannot prevent condensing of dew onto the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface. Thus, there are many problems in the prior art.|$|R
50|$|In Pseudo-steady flows, {{the triple}} point {{moves away from}} <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface and <b>the</b> {{reflection}} is a direct-Mach reflection. In unsteady flows, {{it is also possible}} that the triple point remains stationary relative to <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface (stationary-Mach reflection), or moves toward <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface (inverse-Mach reflection). In inverse Mach reflection, the Mach stem is convex toward the oncoming flow, and the slip plane curves away from <b>the</b> <b>reflecting</b> surface. Each one of these configurations can assume one of the following three possibilities: single-Mach reflection, transitional-Mach reflection and double-Mach reflection.|$|R

5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> wave train departs at the {{supplementary}} angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} {{where this is}} not the case, and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E

5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
5|$|The use of Yehudi {{lights to}} {{camouflage}} aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering {{experiments in the}} Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish; he realized that <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.|$|E

25|$|If the {{collisions}} of body A and the gravific {{particles are}} fully elastic, {{the intensity of}} <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> particles would be as strong as of the incoming ones, so no net directional force would arise. The same is true if a second body B is introduced, where B acts as a shield against gravific particles {{in the direction of}} A. The gravific particle C which ordinarily would strike on A is blocked by B, but another particle D which ordinarily would not have struck A, is re-directed by the reflection on B, and therefore replaces C. Thus if the collisions are fully elastic, <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> particles between A and B would fully compensate any shadowing effect. In order to account for a net gravitational force, it must be assumed that the collisions are not fully elastic, or at least that <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> particles are slowed, so that their momentum is reduced after the impact. This would result in streams with diminished momentum departing from A, and streams with undiminished momentum arriving at A, so a net directional momentum toward the center of A would arise (P3). Under this assumption, <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> particles in the two-body case will not fully compensate the shadowing effect, because <b>the</b> <b>reflected</b> flux is weaker than the incident flux.|$|E
