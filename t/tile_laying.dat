40|$|Expedio parvulus SNYDER, a {{relative}} of Luciogobius guttatus GILL, growing to 50 mm in full grown size, but lacking the ventral fin. The fish had been collected only from Misaki, Kanagawa Pref. and Onahama, Fukushima Pref. in Japan. The authors examined over one hundred specimens newly collected from Hayama in Kanagawa Pref., Tsuyazaki in Fukuoka Pref., Meshima Island and Nomozaki both in Nagasaki Pref. At the rocky shore of Akase, a small reef situated in the coast near the Fisheries Experimental Station of Nagasaki University in Nomozaki (Lat. 32 ° 35. 3 'N, Long. 129 ° 45. 5 'E), the fish was found concealing itself in sand and gravel sedimented under stones or pebbles laying the intertidal zone, and feeding on gammarus, copepods and larvae of shells. In May and August, 1971 three egg masses of this fish attaching to the under sides of stones {{and a piece of}} a roof <b>tile</b> <b>laying</b> in the habitat were collected. In two cases of the spawnings each egg mass was guared by a male parent staying under the stone or roof tile. The egg mass rather dense in one layer, and the eggs numbered 79 and 102 in the two cases. The eggs are club-shaped being 1. 90 to 2. 10 mm in long axis and 0. 62 to 0. 68 mm in short axis, and each provided with a shallow depression encircling at the distal end and a bundle of adhesive filaments at the basal end. The eggs {{are similar to those of}} Luciogobius guitatus in shape, but a little smaller than the latter. It took 144 to 168 hours for development from the formation of the embryonic shield to the hatching at the water temperature changing from 19. 3 ℃ to 21. 3 ℃. The newly hatched larva is 3. 43 mm in total length and it is provided with the large eyes, a remnant of yolk, 44 (23 + 21) myomeres, and the anus opening in the posterior part of the body. The melanophores and xanthophores in the dorsal mid line are characteristic in disposition. Fifty individuals of the newly hatched planktonic larvae were reared in a 30 liter plastic aquarium, and six of them grew up to the juveniles over 15 mm in total length entered into the bottom life in 32 days. They were fed with trocophore larvae of the oyster, Crassostrea gigas in the first feeding stage and with the rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, nauplii of brine shrimp, Artemia salina and planktonic copepods from sea in the next stage. Along with the larval development, the larva became more slender and cylindrical in body form, and the eyes and pectoral fins relatively reduced in size. The rudiment of the air bladder moved from the anterior part to the posterior part of the peritoneal cavity. But the rudiment of the ventral fin did not appear throughout the larval development. From the examination on the collected specimens, it is shown that most of the fish grow over 30 mm in total length and mature in a year, and the life span is over one year...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the respirable dust and respirable silica exposures of roofing workers using an electric-powered circular saw with an aftermarket local exhaust ventilation attachment to cut concrete roofing tiles. The study was conducted to determine whether the local exhaust ventilation attachment was able to control respirable dust and respirable silica exposure below occupational exposure limits (OELs). Time-integrated filter samples and direct reading respirable dust concentrations were evaluated. The local exhaust ventilation consisted of a shroud attached to the cutting plane of the saw; the shroud was then connected to a small electric axial fan, which is intended to collect dust at the point of generation. All sampling was conducted with the control in use. Roofers are defined as those individuals who only <b>lay</b> <b>tiles.</b> Cutters/roofers are defined as those workers who operate the powered saw to cut <b>tiles</b> and also <b>lay</b> <b>tiles.</b> Respirable dust from this evaluation ranged from 0. 13 to 6. 59 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m(3)) with a geometric mean of 0. 38 mg/m(3) for roofers and from 0. 45 to 3. 82 mg/m(3) with a geometric mean of 1. 84 mg/m(3) for cutters/roofers. Cutters/roofers usually handle areas close to crevices, edges, or tips of the roof whereas roofers handle areas where complete tiles can be placed. The respirable dust exposures for all cutters/roofers indicated concentrations exceeding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for respirable dust containing silica; it was also exceeded for some of the roofers. The respirable silica concentrations ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 15 mg/m(3) with a geometric mean of 0. 09 mg/m(3) for roofers, and from 0. 13 to 1. 21 mg/m(3) with a geometric mean of 0. 48 mg/m(3) for cutters/roofers. As with respirable dust, the respirable silica exposures for cutters/roofers were higher than the exposures for roofers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This paper {{discusses}} {{the formation of}} thaumasite in the mortar sub-flooring used as a base material for <b>laying</b> <b>tiles,</b> {{and the influence of}} this mineral in relation to deterioration of building materials. An investigation of a mortar sub-flooring constructed with dolomitic limestone sand with high sulfate content used to settle a ceramic pavement was carried out. RESULTS: The mortar sub-flooring underwent an important deterioration process due to the formation of expansive compounds in the environmental conditions of temperature and humidity of the installation area in Murcia (Spain). Expansion appeared essentially at the interface between the ceramic tiles and the mortar sub-flooring, an area consisting primarily of cement paste. CONCLUSION: Materials present in the soft pulpy mass were examined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-rays. The presence of thaumasite was detected, which had been formed under conditions of temperature higher than temperatures reported in the literature and {{with a high degree of}} humidity.

50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: Tiling - The contestants must <b>lay</b> <b>tile</b> {{on their}} tub decks. Neither Charlene nor Ajay {{are ready for}} tiles as their tub decks are not fully {{installed}} (and their tiles, and Dan's also, will be installed without waterproofing due to Matt having used up all their waterproofing in the last episode), so the experts assist in completing their decks so as {{to level the playing}} field. As for the challenge itself, after a brief one-line lesson from Geoff on how to use tile adhesive (to read the instructions that come with the adhesive), and a longer lesson from Gail on how to tile, the challenge begins in earnest. Charlene had chosen difficult glass tiles which require more finesse, while Matt and Rob use larger tiles; Dan's and Ajay's tiles are ceramic tiles of medium size. Dan manages to use his tile spacers incorrectly, but he tiles his entire tub before realizing his error; he runs out of time and fails before he can dig out the spacers. Matt manages to pass after several initial troubles with cutting tiles upside-down. Rob injures himself repeatedly, and has only two courses of tiles before he runs out of time and fails. Ajay also fails due to taking too long and installing his tiles in an asymmetrical manner, contrary to Gail's directive; he also manages to short out the light fitting in his room after failing to fit the water guard on his tile cutter, which consequently squirts a large jet of water onto the light. The difficulty of Charlene's work causes her to run out of time and fail, though most of the tiles which do not require cutting are up.|$|R
