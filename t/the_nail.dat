5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> small areas of bleeding from capillaries under <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> (onycholysis), and crumbling of <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b>|$|E

5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E
30|$|In the {{standard}} [1], <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with <b>the</b> CN 75 <b>nail</b> is exhibited higher allowable shear strength than that with <b>the</b> CN 50 <b>nail.</b> However, when <b>the</b> <b>nailing</b> space is under restriction and <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints are loaded perpendicular to <b>the</b> grain, <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with <b>the</b> CN 75 <b>nail</b> {{did not always}} have greater shear resistance than that with <b>the</b> CN 50 <b>nail.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{electromagnet}} {{is seen to}} readily {{support a}} collection of nails with its field. When sheets of non-magnetic materials are placed between the magnet and <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> this situation is unaffected, as seen in Figure 1 for a copper sheet. However, when sheets of iron are inserted between the magnet and <b>the</b> <b>nails,</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field lines follow the iron plate, shielding <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> from <b>the</b> magnet so they fall off the magnet...|$|R

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The helmet was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth held together with plaster of Paris. It {{was taken to the}} British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E
60|$|The boy brought Marco a stone, and Marco {{began to}} knock out <b>the</b> <b>nails.</b> Very soon, however, he set the boy at work upon <b>the</b> <b>nails,</b> while he went in pursuit of some short boards, to nail across from one log to the other. He found some, which he thought would answer, without much difficulty, and {{collected}} them together near the logs; and, soon afterwards, the boy brought him <b>the</b> <b>nails.</b>|$|R

30|$|Energy {{capacity}} {{was significantly}} {{affected by the}} edge distance and exhibited large variations, depending on the combination of wood species and <b>nail</b> dimensions. When <b>the</b> edge distance of <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints loaded {{perpendicular to the grain}} was less than 26  mm, the energy capacity of <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with <b>the</b> CN 75 <b>nail</b> was either slightly different or smaller than those with <b>the</b> CN 50 <b>nail.</b>|$|R
5|$|Various {{regions of}} Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling asanbosam, and the Ewe {{people of the}} adze, which can {{take the form of}} a firefly and hunts children. The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
5000|$|Onychotillomania is a {{compulsive}} neurosis {{in which a}} person picks constantly at <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> or tries to tear them off. [...] It {{is not the same as}} onychophagia, where <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> are bitten or chewed or dermatillomania, where skin is bitten or scratched.|$|R

5|$|Throughout her career, Mauboy has {{supported}} various charities in Australia. She is an ambassador for the Sony Foundation, which raises funds for youth-related causes. As an ambassador for the Foundation, Mauboy has made several hospital visits and performed {{at many of}} their annual fundraising events such as Wharf4Ward, which raises funds to build specialised youth cancer centres across Australia. In April 2009, sales from <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> polish bottles Mauboy created with Bloom Cosmetics were donated to Children's Hospital Foundations Australia to support the research into childhood illness. Mauboy has performed at several other fundraising events including charity balls, charity dinners, Christmas carols events, and telethons. For many years, Mauboy has performed at the annual Channel Seven Perth Telethon. In December 2011, she performed free acoustic concerts across Australia {{as part of the}} Indian Pacific Outback Christmas train journey, an annual fund-raiser for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. On 14 December 2012, she performed a free pop up show at Federation Square in Melbourne, as part of the Optus Carols for a Cause event, which raised funds for Kids Helpline and The Smith Family. Mauboy headlined the Come Together charity concert in Ulverstone, Tasmania on 19 May 2013, in aid of two boys who were burnt in an explosion. All proceeds from the concert went into a trust fund for the boys' ongoing treatment.|$|E

25|$|The matrix, {{sometimes}} called the matrix unguis, keratogenous membrane, nail matrix, or onychostroma, is the tissue (or germinal matrix) which <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> protects. It {{is the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed that is beneath <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> and contains nerves, lymph and blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|Trauma to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> {{plate or}} toe, which can occur by {{dropping}} objects on or stubbing the toenail, or by <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> protruding through the shoe (as during sports or other vigorous activity), {{can cause the}} flesh to become injured and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> to grow irregularly and press into the flesh.|$|E
25|$|Starting at {{the bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> the ring shanks on the lower half of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> are {{enhanced}} with angular barbs, which add maximum resistance to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> being pulled out. The middle of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> has no extra features, which leaves the section most likely to be damaged during an earthquake thicker and least prone to damage. The area directly below the head of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> features a spiral-style shank used to enhance the nail's strength in holding boards together. This enhancement keeps boards that are nailed together from moving around under nature's forces and overall weakening the joints. The final feature of this nail is <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> head, which is 25% larger than the average, allowing it to be more resistant to being pulled completely through attached pieces of wood.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{speculation}} that the Gauls were <b>the</b> first to <b>nail</b> on metal horseshoes. <b>The</b> <b>nailed</b> iron horseshoe first clearly appeared in the archaeological record in Europe in about the 5th century AD when a horseshoe, complete with nails, {{was found in the}} tomb of the Frankish King Childeric I at Tournai, Belgium. [...] In Gallo-Roman countries, the hipposandal appears to have briefly co-existed with <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> horseshoe.|$|R

30|$|Shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on nailed joints in wood that were loaded perpendicular to the grain; these joints had 21 specifications depending on different combinations of wood species, nail dimensions, number of nails, and edge distances of the main members, and their effects on the shear resistance of <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were also investigated. <b>The</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with CN 75 nails had higher initial stiffness than the joints with CN 50 <b>nails,</b> provided <b>the</b> initial stiffness of nailed joints connected with 3 or 5 nails was not always a simple product of <b>the</b> number of <b>nails</b> and <b>the</b> initial stiffness of nailed joints connected with a nail, and instead depended on the combination of wood species of the main member and <b>nail</b> dimensions. When <b>the</b> edge distance decreased, the maximum load and energy capacity decreased, thereby affecting the energy capacity. The maximum load of <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with CN 75 nails may be smaller than those with CN 50 <b>nails</b> depending on <b>the</b> combination of wood species and <b>nail</b> dimensions. When <b>the</b> edge distance of <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints was less than 26  mm, the energy capacity of <b>the</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with CN 75 nails was less than or similar to those with CN 50 nails.|$|R
