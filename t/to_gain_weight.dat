40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} young women's weight-influenced self-esteem (WISE) in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and <b>weight</b> loss, and its relations to body satisfaction, body comparisons and global self-esteem. Young women {{from two different}} regions, that is, from the north of The Netherlands (n = 157) and from the Willemstad area (the capital of Curacao; n = 162), completed a questionnaire. It was expected that Dutch women would show lower self-esteem in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> than women from Curacao, and that self-esteem in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> would be negatively related to general self-esteem and body satisfaction, and more so among Dutch women than among Curacaoan women. Finally, {{it was expected that}} body comparisons would be predictive of lower self-esteem in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> As expected Dutch women showed lower self-esteem in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> than Curacaoan women. Moreover, findings showed that among Curacaoan women self-esteem in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> was not related to general self-esteem or body satisfaction and that body comparisons were less predictive of lowered self-esteem in response <b>to</b> imagined <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> than among Dutch women.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study is}} an {{application}} {{of the theory of}} planned behaviour (TPB) with additional variables to predict the motivations <b>to</b> prevent <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> In addition, variations in measures across individuals classified into Precaution Adoption Process stages (PAPM-stages) of behaviour change were investigated. Methods A cross-sectional survey among 979 non-obese Dutch adults aged 25 – 35 years was conducted. Multiple binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations of Body Mass Index (BMI), demographic factors and psychosocial variables from the TPB with the intention <b>to</b> prevent <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Differences in BMI, demographic and psychosocial factors between PAPM-stages were explored using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests. Results Eighty-five percent of respondents intended <b>to</b> prevent <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Age, attitudes and risk perceptions related <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> were the strongest correlates of intention (age: OR = 1. 12, 95 %CI: 1. 04 – 1. 20; attitude OR = 7. 91, 95 %CI: 5. 33 – 11. 74; risk perception OR = 1. 24, 95 %CI: 1. 11 – 1. 38). Significant differences were detected between the PAPM-stages in almost all variables. Notably, perceived behavioural control was lowest among people who had decided <b>to</b> prevent <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Conclusion Messages <b>to</b> influence attitudes towards the prevention of <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and risk perception may affect people who are not yet motivated <b>to</b> prevent <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Interventions increasing people's perceived behavioural control in overcoming barriers <b>to</b> prevent <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> may help people to act on their intentions. </p...|$|R

Multimodal stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in premature infant development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> <b>weight</b> more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during multimodal stimulation. While the voice is a popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box.

The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.|$|E

40|$|Slow <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> {{in infancy}} {{is the core}} sign of failure to thrive. However, {{it is far from}} clear what the cause of the slow <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> in infancy is. Failure to thrive is mostly {{identified}} late in the first year at which time it becomes problematic to ascertain its causes retrospectively. The current study was designed <b>to</b> investigate <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and behaviour in the early weeks of infancy in a prospective study. Seventy-five eight-week old infants were recruited according <b>to</b> their <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> from birth <b>to</b> eight weeks, and classified as having slow, average or fast <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Infants and their mothers were observed during two feeds. Mother-infant interaction and sucking behaviour were assessed. In addition, mothers completed questionnaires on the infant's temperament and behaviour (such as sleeping and crying), and on their own eating behaviour and adaptation to motherhood. All infants were followed up at six months and weighed again. The follow-up weight at six months allowed the identification of infants with failure to thrive as traditionally clinically defined. Six infants were identified as failing to thrive at six months, all of which had slow <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> from birth <b>to</b> eight weeks. The behaviours measured through observation and the questionnaires were investigated in relation <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> from birth <b>to</b> eight weeks and six months. No significant relationship was found between <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and maternal adaptation, the mother's eating behaviour or infant behaviour. One sucking behaviour parameter estimate, pause length, end, was found to be significantly related <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> <b>to</b> eight weeks. This result however, was entirely attributable to the estimates of one infant. This infant had particularly poor sucking behaviour and very slow <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> from birth <b>to</b> eight weeks. Infant temperament, and in particular the infant's level of fear was related <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> from birth <b>to</b> eight weeks. Infants with higher levels of fear were more likely <b>to</b> have slow <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> The length of the feed, from which the sucking behaviour was observed, was related <b>to</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> with infants with long feeds being more likely <b>to</b> have slow <b>weight</b> <b>gain...</b>|$|R
