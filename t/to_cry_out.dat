5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She {{falls in love}} with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him {{in the form of a}} pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not {{realising}} who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the Lia Fáil (stone of destiny), fails <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax {{on her back and}} arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out.</b> He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
25|$|Like all non-depolarising muscle relaxants, pancuronium has {{no effect}} on level of consciousness. Therefore, if the {{anaesthetic}} used is insufficient, the individual may be awake but unable <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> or move due to the effect of the pancuronium. There have been several civil lawsuits alleging similar failures of adequate anaesthesia during general surgical procedures. These have been largely due to improper or insufficient dosages of anaesthetic in concert with normal dosages of muscle relaxants such as pancuronium.|$|E

The house had been searched three times before, but the bedroom closet where {{her body was found}} was not searched. Rev. Harry McIntyre looked in bedroom closets on February 26, but it never occurred to him to search the front-bedroom closet. [...] "I concentrated on the basement, believing the girl might have fallen down the stairs," [...] he said. A volunteer fireman, John Reeves, also searched the first-floor bedroom but not the closet. Barker may have been too frightened <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
500|$|All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes {{begins as}} Angelou's {{previous}} book, The Heart of a Woman, ends: with her {{depiction of a}} serious automobile accident involving her son Guy. [...] After spending two years in Cairo, they come to Accra to enroll Guy in the University of Ghana, and the accident occurs three days after they arrive. [...] Following Guy's long convalescence, they remain in Ghana, Angelou for four years, from 1962 to 1965. [...] Angelou describes Guy's recovery, including her deep depression. [...] She is confronted by her friend Julian Mayfield, who introduces her to writer and actor Efua Sutherland, the Director of the National Theatre of Ghana. [...] Sutherland becomes Angelou's [...] "sister-friend" [...] and allows her <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> all her pain and bitterness.|$|E
500|$|The play {{starts with}} the term [...] "May I come", a warning to higher-caste people that Dalits had <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> before {{entering}} any street, so as to not pollute the higher caste members. The Nayanar first clashes with his own Dalit brethren. They oppose his devotion for the Lord of Chidambaram, whom they call a Brahmin god. The Dalit elders— headed by Pariyakilavan— define his duties as a pariah and advise him to not confront caste rules. They tell him to worship the folk deities of the pariah, instead of Shiva, the god of Brahmanical Hinduism. The Dalits also feel that Nandanar needs {{to abide by the}} social norms and give up his taboo idea of entering a temple.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{animated}} film Peter Pan, Hook {{is a far}} more comical villain than the original character: he is seen as a vain coward with a childish, infantile temper who is prone <b>to</b> <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> in terror. During the film's early development, the story department analysed Hook's character as [...] "a fop... Yet very mean, {{to the point of being}} murderous. This combination of traits should cause plenty of amusement whenever he talks or acts".|$|R

500|$|Angelou {{comes to}} terms with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendant of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African-American who has experienced racism. As she tells interviewer Connie Martinson, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. [...] She remains in Accra after his accident because it was traumatic for her as well—so traumatic it reduces her to silence, similar to her muteness after she was raped as a child in Caged Bird. [...] Her friend Julian Mayfield introduces her to Efua Sutherland, who becomes Angelou's [...] "Sister friend" [...] and allows her <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> her pain, grief, and fear, something Angelou later admitted went against her American upbringing of emotional restraint.|$|E
2500|$|In 1875, the Rev. J. S. Gibney, the school's honorary {{secretary}} since its inception, {{died when he}} fell through a skylight. [...] He had been inspecting {{the roof of the}} school with a joiner, George Allis, and in particular had been discussing with Allis alterations he wanted made to a skylight, when he began tapping the glass with his right foot, lost his balance, and fell through, down into the model room below. [...] He was supposedly heard <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out,</b> 'My God', as he fell. [...] The inquest into his death was held at the White Hart Hotel and the jury returned a verdict of accidental death.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the plot}} progresses, Hilaret is set upon by Ramble, which provokes her <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> [...] "rape". During this time, Constant, {{in an attempt}} to help a woman, is also accused of rape. They are taken before Justice Squeezum, who reveals his abuses of the {{judicial}} system. Hilaret comically forms a plot to catch the corrupt Justice Squeezum; he is able to overcome it because Fielding promotes dealing with corruption only through legal means, which Hilaret fails to do when she resorts to relying on falsified evidence. Although Justice Squeezum and his corrupt nature almost overcomes the other characters, the manner in which this happens is done in a farcical way to provoke laughter.|$|E

2500|$|Union {{commander}} William S. Rosecrans wired Abraham Lincoln saying [...] "We have no {{certainty of}} holding our position here." [...] Lincoln responded by sending reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac and Army of the Tennessee, {{with the overall}} command of the force under Ulysses S. Grant, recently promoted to command of the Military Division of the Mississippi. On October 26 Grant initiated operations to open a supply route from Brown's Ferry to Chattanooga. [...] The plan was conceived and to be executed by Grant's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. William F. [...] "Baldy" [...] Smith. Hardtack, an army food staple, was usually despised by {{the men who were}} forced to eat it on a constant basis. However, with food running low the soldiers began <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> even for the hardtack crackers. Thus the proposed supply line was dubbed the [...] "Cracker Line".|$|E
2500|$|In the 17th century, Miguel Sánchez {{interpreted}} the Virgin as addressing herself {{specifically to the}} Indians, while noting that Juan Diego himself regarded all the residents of New Spain as his spiritual heirs, the inheritors of the holy image. The Virgin's own words to Juan Diego as reported by Sánchez were equivocal: she wanted a place at Tepeyac where she can show herself:"as a compassionate mother to you and yours, to my devotees, to those who should seek me for the relief of their necessities". By contrast, {{the words of the}} Virgin's initial message as reported in Nican Mopohua are, in terms, specific to all residents of New Spain without distinction, while including others, too:"I am the compassionate mother of you and of all you people here in this land, and of the other various peoples who love me, who cry out to me [...]." [...] The special but not exclusive favour of the Virgin to the indigenous peoples is highlighted in Lasso de la Vega's introduction:"you wish us your children <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> to , especially the local people, the humble commoners to whom you revealed yourself" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} named after Cutty-sark, the {{nickname}} of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burns's 1791 poem Tam o' Shanter. The ship's figurehead, the original {{of which has been}} attributed to carver Fredrick Hellyer of Blackwall, is a stark white carving of a bare-breasted Nannie Dee with long black hair holding a grey horse's tail in her hand. In the poem she wore a linen [...] (Scots: a short chemise or undergarment), that she had been given as a child, which explains why it was cutty, or in other words far too short. The erotic sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> [...] " [...] done, Cutty-sark", which subsequently became a well known catchphrase. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to 'good taste'. Tam o' Shanter riding Meg was to be seen along the ship's quarter. The motto, Where there's a Willis away, was inscribed along the taffrail. The Tweed, which acted as a model for much of the ship which followed her, had a figurehead depicting Tam o' Shanter.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Lancelyn Green, {{the editor}} of the 2000 Oxford {{paperback}} edition of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, surmises that Doyle's source for the story appears to have been the article named [...] "Called on by a Boa Constrictor. A West African Adventure" [...] in Cassell's Saturday Journal, published in February 1891. In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. [...] On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees [...] "a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it". It {{turns out to be the}} largest Boa constrictor he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows. The bell cord had rotted away, but by means of a stick he manages to ring it and raise the alarm.|$|E
2500|$|Once back in Britain, the Scots Greys {{returned}} to Scotland where they helped police the countryside. In 1715, the Earl Mar declared for the [...] "Old Pretender", James Stuart, sparking the Jacobite Rising. Remaining {{loyal to the}} Anglo-German king, the Scots Greys were active in putting down the uprising. This included taking part at the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November 1715. There the Scots Greys, under the Duke of Argyll, were stationed {{on the right of}} the Government forces. Also known at that time as Portmore's Dragoons, the Scots Greys initially attacked the left flank of the Jacobite army. Advancing around a bog, which the highlanders had thought would protect their flank, the Scots Greys surprised the highlanders, making repeated charges into disordered ranks of the Jacobite infantry. The Scots Greys continue to pursue the shattered left wing of the Jacobite force as it fled for nearly two miles until it was blocked by the river Allan. Unable to fall back, disorganised, they were easy targets for the Scots Greys' dragoons. It is reported that the Duke of Argyll was said <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> to [...] "Spare the poor blue bonnets!". However, little quarter was given by Scots Greys to any group trying to rally that day. The rest of the royal forces were not as successful. The Jacobites managed to route the left wing of the Royal army, the day ending in a tactical standoff.|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
