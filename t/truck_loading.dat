US air interdiction against the Trail increased as PAVN {{stepped up its}} activities. As noted above, the risk of air attack caused men and material to move along linked, but separate routes, and <b>truck</b> <b>loading</b> operated in shuttle fashion. The sheer volumes moving down the trail however meant that the PAVN effort came under severe strain. Great pains were taken to camouflage movement. Bridges across water obstacles were often built under water, difficult to detect from the air, and multiple crossing points were developed. Wherever possible PAVN units minimized disturbances to the jungle cover, and even transplanted foliage from elsewhere to cover and conceal signs of movement. PAVN sources claim that the 559th Transport group camouflaged some [...] out of the [...] of trail.|$|E

40|$|Similar to American LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, {{the current}} Chinese bridge design code is fully {{calibrated}} against gravity load and live load. Earthquake load {{is generally considered}} alone and has its own methodology, however, which is not covered in the code in a consistent probability-based fashion. Earthquake <b>load</b> and <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> are the main loads considered in the basis of bridge design in more than 70 % of seismic areas in China. They are random processes, and their combination is the main subject of this paper. Seismic characteristics of southeast coastal areas of China are discussed and an earthquake probability curve is calculated through seismic risk analysis. Using measured <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> data from a Bridge Health Monitoring System, the multimodal characteristics of <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> are analyzed and a probability model for a time interval t is obtained by fitting results and reliability theory. Then, a methodology is presented to combine earthquake <b>load</b> and <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> on a probabilistic basis. To illustrate this method, <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> and earthquake load combinations are used. Results conceptually illustrate that <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> and earthquake load are not dominant in southeast coastal areas of China, but the effect of their combination is. This methodology quantitatively demonstrates that the design is controlled by <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> in most ranges; that is, <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> {{is more important to}} bridge design in the region...|$|R

40|$|<b>Truck</b> <b>load</b> {{represents}} a major load to highway facilities, such as bridges and pavements. Therefore <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> spectra {{are an important}} factor in the decision making process for these facilities, including design, evaluation, maintenance, and replacement. These load spectra are significantly influenced by the truck weight limits of the jurisdiction. This paper presents a method for predicting <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> spectra as a result of changes in truck weight limits. Two application examples are included here for illustration and evaluation. Results show that the proposed method can model the effects of these changes on <b>truck</b> <b>load</b> spectra. This method can be used in planning truck weight limit changes with respect to their impact on bridges...|$|R

[...] The absence of suitable dust collection and filter systems in cement silos or at the <b>truck</b> <b>loading</b> point is {{the major source of}} particulate matter emission in the air. The loading point is a large emission point for dust pollution, so many concrete producers utilize central dust collectors to contain this dust. Notably, many transit mix (dry loading) plants create significantly more dust pollution than central mix plants {{due to the nature of}} the batching process. A final source of concern for many municipalities is the presence of extensive water runoff and reuse for water spilled on a producer's sites.|$|E
