5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about <b>the</b> <b>Society.</b> Those articles were often sensationalist and served to put <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> in a bad light. The views and practices of <b>the</b> <b>Society,</b> particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor Rathbone led <b>the</b> <b>society</b> as its {{secretary}} from 1897, {{especially in}} campaigning in the 1910 elections.

When <b>the</b> <b>society</b> disagreed with the NUWSS, it merged with the Municipal Women's Association to create the Liverpool Women's Citizens Association in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Romney Literary Society's {{membership}} was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the Potomac Highlands region. For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>society</b> greatly influenced trends of {{thought in the}} Romney community and surrounding areas. No records of the society's proceedings, works, or membership enrollments spanning the period between January 22, 1830 and 1861 are extant. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>society</b> counted among its members Angus William McDonald, John Baker White, and Robert White.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the {{residents}} of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. <b>The</b> <b>society</b> remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>society</b> were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect {{what remained of the}} library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were John Collins Covell, Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy, Henry Bell Gilkeson, Howard Hille Johnson, and Christian Streit White. <b>The</b> <b>society,</b> with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the Reconstruction Era.|$|E

5|$|Fortune's Fraternity survived her, and {{was renamed}} <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of the Inner Light in 1946; {{the change was}} a legal {{refinement}} to help the group achieve charitable status. It continues to operate into the early 21st century. <b>The</b> <b>Society</b> sold the Chalice Orchard, which was eventually purchased by Geoffrey Ashe, and in 1959 sold their Bayswater headquarters after the socio-economic decline of the area, instead establishing a base in North London. While retaining its basis in Fortune's original teachings, <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> has changed its emphasis according to who has led it over the years. At various points it has been heavily influenced by Alice Bailey's ideas about the Ascended Masters, the ideas of Subud, {{and the use of}} Scientology's E-meters. In 1961, <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> adopted a new approach which further emphasised and foregrounded its Christian identity. This generated controversy in the group, with Gareth Knight leaving to form his own lodge based on Fortune's teachings, known as the Gareth Knight Group. In 1973 one of Fortune's students, W. E. Butler, likewise split with the Fraternity to found his own group in Jersey, the Servants of the Light, which would later be taken over by Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki and remains one of the world's largest esoteric organizations in the early 21st century maintaining about 1000 active students. In 1975, another member of <b>the</b> <b>Society,</b> Alan Adams, departed to start the London Group, which was initially based in outer London but later moved to the East Midlands.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E

40|$|When {{measuring}} a society's deprivation in a multi-attribute framework, researchers often {{resort to}} {{what we call a}} 'column-first two-stage procedure'. Under such procedures one first determines <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> deprivation for each attribute separately by aggregating the individuals' deprivation levels in terms of that attribute, and then assesses <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> overall deprivation by aggregating <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> deprivation levels for different attributes. In this paper, we argue that all such procedures are seriously flawed insofar as none of them can satisfy simultaneously three highly appealing properties: (i) anonymity, which requires that the individuals be treated symmetrically; (ii) non-invariance, which reflects the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> overall deprivation to certain switches of deprivation levels between individuals; and (iii) positive responsiveness, which requires that <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> overall deprivation must increase if <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> deprivation for some attribute increases without any decrease in <b>the</b> <b>society's</b> deprivation for any attribute.
