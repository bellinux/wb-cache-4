5|$|In {{the tropics}} {{there is little}} {{variation}} in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E

5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly hit, some local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out confidence-building measures among <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city.|$|E
5|$|The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains {{are partly}} in the {{northern}} section of the forest. The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana border is on the northern frontier. The Oregon Trail, the 19th century covered wagon route, passes {{just south of the}} forest, where broad and gentle South Pass allowed <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> to bypass the rugged mountains to the north.|$|E
5|$|The Western Roman Empire {{began to}} {{disintegrate}} {{in the early}} 5th century as Germanic migrations and invasions overwhelmed {{the capacity of the}} Empire to assimilate <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> and fight off the invaders. The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders, most famously Attila, though the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer. By placing himself under the rule of the Eastern Emperor, rather than naming himself Emperor (as other Germanic chiefs had done after deposing past emperors), Odoacer ended the Western Empire by ending the line of Western emperors.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. We can {{therefore}} conclude that when <b>the</b> <b>migrant’s</b> portfolio is diversified, <b>the</b> more <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> wishes to invest for period 2, the more he/she remits.|$|R
40|$|It is {{understandable}} that remittances are larger if <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> is more altruistic. However, remittances that the household expects to receive, i. e. expected remittances, depend not only on remittances by <b>the</b> <b>migrant,</b> who has already moved to the host county, but also on how {{likely it is that}} a household member, a potential migrant, actually migrates. Such a probability can also be affected by altruism. However, previous studies focused mainly on the effects of altruism on remittances by <b>the</b> <b>migrant.</b> In this study, we investigate the effects of altruism on migration decisions by <b>the</b> potential <b>migrant,</b> as well as on remittances by <b>the</b> <b>migrant,</b> to make clear how altruism affects expected remittances. We show that altruism and the income difference between the host and home countries increase remittances by <b>the</b> <b>migrant.</b> However, if migration incurs costs, <b>the</b> potential <b>migrant</b> does not necessarily migrate, and for a given income difference, <b>the</b> potential <b>migrant</b> who is more altruistic is less likely to migrate. Therefore, expected remittances do not necessarily increase with the degree of altruism. In particular, expected remittances are likely to be smaller if <b>the</b> potential <b>migrant</b> is more altruistic when the host country’s income is sufficiently larger than the home country’s income...|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. Indeed, <b>the</b> more <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> remits, <b>the</b> more his/her {{consumption}} path is distorted at {{the expense}} of first period utility. This cost is convex, while the benefit in terms of second period consumption is concave. The second case occurs if, due to liquidity constraints, <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> is unable to spend enough remittances so as to raise their return {{to the level of the}} return to savings, τ. Then, remittances are at a corner and <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> saves instead.|$|R
5|$|Control over Gangetic plains {{region was}} of vital {{importance}} to the power and stability of all of India's major empires, including the Maurya (320–200 BC), Kushan (CE 100–250), Gupta (350–600), and Gurjara-Pratihara (650–1036) empires. Following the Huns' invasions that broke the Gupta empire, the Ganges-Yamuna Doab saw the rise of Kannauj. During the reign of Harshavardhana (590–647), the Kannauj empire reached its zenith. It spanned from Punjab {{in the north and}} Gujarat in the west to Bengal in the east and Odisha in the south. It included parts of central India, north of the Narmada River and it encompassed the entire Indo-Gangetic plain. Many communities in various parts of India claim descent from <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> of Kannauj. Soon after Harshavardhana's death, his empire disintegrated into many kingdoms, which were invaded and ruled by the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, which challenged Bengal's Pala Empire for control of the region. Kannauj was several times invaded by the south Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty, from the 8th century to the 10th century.|$|E
25|$|Following the Tunisian Revolution of 2010–11, the {{government}} of Italy gave six-month residence permits to some 25,000 Tunisian migrants. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> to travel freely in the Schengen Area. In response, both France and Germany threatened to impose border checks, not wanting the Tunisian refugees to enter their territory.

So many Russian Jews arrived in Jaffa that the town ran out of accommodation and the local Jews began forming communities outside the Jaffa city walls.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{about the}} challenge of education for <b>migrant</b> children in <b>the</b> rapidly urbanized Chinese society. An ethnographic research was conducted in one of <b>the</b> unregistered <b>migrant</b> schools in Beijing. Through a triangulation of research methods of participatory observation, semi-structured and life history interview, as well as photography, the research, from emic perspectives, analyzes {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> schools in education provision to <b>migrant</b> children, understands <b>the</b> gaps between policy commitments and on-the-ground delivery of public education provision, and raises a few policy recommendations of developing <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> schools and improving education provision to <b>migrant</b> children. <b>The</b> findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> schools have played an important role in meeting the unfulfilled demand for education for migrant children in cities. However, the pursuit of short-term profits compromise education quality of such schools, the problem of inequality of quality becomes significant when <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> schools function to reduce inequality of opportunity. In addition, the findings show that the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>migrant</b> schools and local governments are of critical importance for school development. Based on the research, I would propose that the emerging public-private partnerships in education service provision can be an effective way to diversify and expand service provision channel and benefit the school, <b>the</b> state and <b>migrant</b> children...|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{circular}} migration {{has been described}} as a triple-win scenario, providing benefits for the host country, the home country, and <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> themselves. Developed countries allow migrants to enter in order to fill labor shortages, but with the understanding that the settlement is not permanent, distinguishing it from immigration. Developing countries benefit in the sense that they are not truly losing their skilled migrants, as these workers will return after a period of time to continue working. <b>The</b> <b>migrants</b> themselves benefit through the skills they learn abroad, as well as their increase in wages. The form of benefits in this triple-win discourse often take three forms: financial capital, human capital, and social capital. Circularity is the most beneficial whenever migrants move voluntary between locations in the pursuit of different interests, as well as when migrants have positive experiences while abroad, including financial and educational success.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} is the freedom of <b>the</b> <b>migrants.</b> Some scholars have questioned whether these workers are moving {{into a state of}} “unfreedom”. Recruitment into circular migration may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and debt bondage. Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their destination country, migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging circular migration. This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} <b>the</b> <b>migrants</b> are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area of destination in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E
