5|$|Born in {{the city}} of St Albans, Hertfordshire, Gibbs {{attended}} How Wood primary school, and as a nine-year-old striker helped his team win a district six-a-side competition. Gibbs began training with and supporting Watford from an early age, and was watching from the Main Stand at Vicarage Road as Watford sealed the Fourth Division title in 1978. Although part of Watford's youth system, he occasionally played for St Albans City's youth team due to <b>their</b> <b>close</b> proximity to his home and school. He also played for Hertfordshire schools at under-14 to under-16 levels.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their young}} age, the three editors {{were able to}} attract collaborations from {{established}} Symbolist authors, active within Romania's own Symbolist movement. Alongside <b>their</b> <b>close</b> friend and mentor Adrian Maniu (an Imagist who had been Vinea's tutor), they included N. Davidescu, Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, Emil Isac, Claudia Millian, Ion Minulescu, I. M. Rașcu, Eugeniu Sperantia, Al. T. Stamatiad, Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est, Constantin T. Stoika, {{as well as the}} journalist and lawyer Poldi Chapier. In its inaugural issue, the journal even printed a poem by one of the leading figures in Romanian Symbolism, Alexandru Macedonski. Simbolul also featured illustrations by Maniu, Millian and Iosif Iser.|$|E
5|$|During {{the term}} of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford {{received}} monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and domestic issues, and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. <b>Their</b> <b>close</b> friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} use of metric units was legalised for trade in the UK in 1864, the UK had signed the Metre Convention in 1884 and the UK Parliament had defined the yard and the pound {{in terms of the}} metre and the {{kilogram}} in 1897, the UK continued to use the imperial system of measure and to export the imperial system of units to the Empire. In 1932, the system of Imperial Preference was set up at the Ottawa Conference. Although Ireland left the Commonwealth in 1948 and South Africa in 1961, both continued <b>their</b> <b>close</b> economic ties with the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|Gymnopils maritimus {{is clearly}} a {{different}} species from other members of its clade, despite <b>their</b> <b>close</b> relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{while the}} Roeriches {{were engaged in}} a long period of travel in Central Asia, Horch began to acquire the lots {{surrounding}} the mansion to construct the Master Building. The Roeriches' extensive travels were almost entirely funded by Louis Horch. As is common when assembling adjacent lots for a single purpose, he used dummies as purchasers. In doing this he followed a pattern he had established in providing an organizational structure for the Master Institute when he installed the Roeriches and <b>their</b> <b>close</b> associates as nominal shareholders and corporate officers.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} {{conflict}} between commemorations (for example, November 11 with St. Martin of Tours and Søren Kierkegaard), there is no order of precedence, and individual worship planners need to choose which commemoration, if any, to highlight. In some cases, several individuals are listed together (June 14 with St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. Gregory of Nyssa) because of <b>their</b> <b>close</b> association with each other, and they are thus designed to be commemorated jointly, not as a choice between one or the other.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the subject of {{subsequent}} studies seeking to clarify the relationships within Mentheae. Further research combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with rbcL sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between Perovskia and Salvia clade I. It also distinguished between P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides, while confirming <b>their</b> <b>close</b> relationship. A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia.|$|E
5|$|The Blastocladiomycota were {{previously}} considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, {{and they are}} parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike <b>their</b> <b>close</b> relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit zygotic meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis.|$|E

5|$|The Chytridiomycota are {{commonly}} known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and <b>their</b> <b>close</b> relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single flagellum, leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} the 2015 study which {{resolved}} the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton's parakeet, due to <b>their</b> <b>close</b> evolutionary relationship. The echo parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s, numbering only twenty individuals, but has since recovered, so introducing it to the nearby islands could also help secure the survival of this species.|$|E

Arizona, who had {{appeared}} in a bowl game {{in four of the}} previous five seasons, made the Pac-12's first appearance in the New Mexico Bowl. Nevada made its eighth consecutive bowl appearance and second all-time in the New Mexico Bowl.|$|E

5|$|After relegation to the Second Division in 1963, {{the future}} looked bleak {{with a record}} low home {{attendance}} of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965. In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell. Two seasons later, in 1967–68, Manchester City claimed the League Championship for the second time, clinching the title {{on the final day}} of the season with a 4–3 win at Newcastle United and beating <b>their</b> <b>close</b> neighbours Manchester United into second place. Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969, before achieving European success by winning the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970, beating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in Vienna. City also won the League Cup that season, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.|$|E
5|$|Examining both {{morphological}} {{and genetic}} (cytochrome b) characters in 2008, German biologist Michael Wink and colleagues {{concluded that the}} southern boobook is distinct from the morepork and Tasmanian boobook (which they proposed to be raised to species status as Ninox leucopsis), {{and that it is}} instead the sister taxon to the barking owl (N. connivens). A 2017 study by Singapore-based biologist Chyi Yin Gwee and colleagues analysing both multi-locus DNA and boobook calls confirmed a sister relationship of leucopsis and novaeseelandiae and <b>their</b> <b>close</b> relationship to connivens. Additionally, genetic and call analysis show the Christmas boobook (N. natalis) to be very close to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified within this species.|$|E
5|$|Few {{people in}} London other than <b>their</b> <b>close</b> friends {{knew that the}} couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E
