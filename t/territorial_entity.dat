In 1000, Boleslaw the Brave, continuing the policy of his father Mieszko, held a Congress of Gniezno and created the metropolis of Gniezno and the dioceses of Kraków, Kołobrzeg, and Wrocław. However, the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by Casimir I the Restorer.|$|E

25|$|The TFN {{worked for}} ten years and, in September 1992, came to a final {{agreement}} with the Government of Canada. This agreement called for {{the separation of the}} Northwest Territories into an eastern territory whose Aboriginal population would be predominately Inuit, the future Nunavut, and a rump Northwest Territories in the west. It was the largest land claims agreement in Canadian history. In November 1992, the Nunavut Final Agreement was approved by nearly 85% of the Inuit of what would become Nunavut. As the final step in this long process, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement was signed on May 25, 1993, in Iqaluit by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and by Paul Quassa, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, which replaced the TFN with the ratification of the Nunavut Final Agreement. The Canadian Parliament passed the supporting legislation in June of the same year, enabling the 1999 establishment of Nunavut as a <b>territorial</b> <b>entity.</b>|$|E
500|$|Territorial {{occupation}} only {{became a}} central concern for Portugal {{in the last}} decades of the 19th century, during the European powers' [...] "Scramble for Africa", especially following the 1884 Berlin Conference. A number of military expeditions were organized as preconditions for obtaining territory which roughly corresponded to that of present-day Angola. However, as late as 1906 only about 6% of that territory was effectively occupied, and the military campaigns had to continue. By the mid-1920s, {{the limits of the}} territory were finally fixed, and the last [...] "primary resistance" [...] was quelled in the early 1940s. It is thus reasonable to talk of Angola as a defined <b>territorial</b> <b>entity</b> from this point onwards.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{constitutional}} arrangements of various <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> in the South-West Pacific, {{leading to a}} discussion of those entities’ status in international law. In particular, it examines the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, Norfolk Island, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and American Samoa – all of which are perceived as ‘Territories’ in the international community – as a way of critically examining the concept of ‘Statehood’ in international law. 	 The study finds that many of these ‘Territories’ do not necessarily fit the classification that they have been given. In particular, most of the <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> listed above have significant competence to control their own domestic affairs. Some have also begun to develop their own international legal personality by virtue of de facto control over their own external affairs. The United Nations’ focus on ensuring self-determination also indicates that these <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> are likely to gain more autonomy as time goes on. As a result, this paper argues that some of the ‘Territories’ are not necessarily Territories at all; instead, they possess independent control over their own domestic and external affairs, and therefore act as de facto States on the global stage. However, many of these <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> still remain heavily associated with recognised sovereign States, with none of the included <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> possessing their own de jure Head of State or citizenship: both of which are arguably key foundations of an independent identity. Consequently, there are still questions over {{the extent to which the}} <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> can be considered sovereign, especially given that the relevant ‘administering States’ still seem to take economic responsibility for their <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> if they believe the situation warrants it. Given these points, this paper argues in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept of Statehood. It argues that the rise of <b>territorial</b> <b>entities</b> which not only have independent control over their affairs, but which also have significant links to existing States, means that terms such as independence and sovereignty are not either/or concepts. Instead, these concepts should be seen as spectrums, giving rise to a broader definition of Statehood that does not restrictively define States as independent, sovereign entities, but that embraces the concept of ‘Freely Associated States’...|$|R
