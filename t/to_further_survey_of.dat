They were collected from five localities of the District and 28 from the Tohoku District located at the northern regions beyond the Kanto District. In the five localities in the Kanto District, diploids, tetraploids and hexaploids were detected and aneuploids {{by the addition of}} B-chromosomes were found in the diploids and the tetraploids as in the previous reports. In the 28 localities of the Tohoku District, only the tetraploids were confirmed and B-chromosome was not found in them at all. The polymorphism of the L^ -chromosomes studied in the tetraploids from the Tohoku District and then the five types were recognized. Of the five types, the II 1 a was predominant (75. 2 %) and the II 2 a was found with the second highest frequency (15. 3 %). The predominant occurrence of these two types in the District is absolutely the same as in the tetetraploids investigated before. 関東地方およびその周辺地域のシロヨメナ群における倍数体の出現とその分布を更に調べる為に,関東地方の 5 集団と東北地方の 28 集団から採集した 269 株を核学的に調べた。関東地方の集団には,二倍体,四倍体および六倍体が確認され,二倍体と四倍体にはB-染色体の付加による異数体が見いだされた。東北地方の 27 集団の株はすべて四倍体であり,B-染色体は全く見出だされなかった。また,東北地方の四倍体でL^ -染色体の多型性を調べたところ, 5 型が区別された。これらの内II 1 aが最も高頻度(75. 2 %) に出現し,次いでII 2 a (15. 3 %) であった。これら二型の高頻度出現は,前報の四倍体における結果と同じであった...|$|R

40|$|In order <b>to</b> make <b>further</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> the {{distribution}} of polyploids in the Aster ageratoides subsp. leiophyllus group in the Kanto District and the surrounding area, including the northern regions beyond the District, 77 localities having 633 clones were studied karyologically. The polyploidy that consisted of diploidy (2 n= 18), triploidy (2 n= 27), tetraploidy (2 n= 36) and hexaploidy (2 n= 54) was validated in this study. Furthermore, a nonaploid clone {{was found in a}} hexaploid population for the first time. The hexaploids were distributed in extensive regions from the central regions of the District to the northern region beyond the District, with diploids and tetraploids encircling the hexaploids or being accompanied with the diploids. The tetraploids were found to be distributed mainly in the northern and northwest regions over the hexaploid distribution range of the District. Aneuploids by the addition of B-chromosomes varying in number from one to six were found in diploids, tetraploids and hexaploids of 25 among the 80 localities studied and the 12 types of B-chromosomes were recognized. The six natural hybrids (2 n= 45) were found in the five localities, and had originated from the cross between hexaploid form of var. leiophyllus (2 n= 54) and A. ageratoides subsp. ovatus (2 n= 36). After further studies of polymorphism of L^ -chromosomes, a partial revision of a criteria on classification of this chromosome was proposed and the 12 types were recognized. The polyploidy level was higher, the polymorphism of the L^ -chromosomes was more extensive. シロヨメナ群の関東地方およびその周辺地域における倍数体の出現と分布を更に調べるために,関東地方とこれより以北の地域を含む 77 地点から採集した 633 株を核学的に研究した。本研究においても,シロヨメナ群に二倍性(2 n= 18),三倍性(2 n= 27),四倍性(2 n= 36) と六倍性(2 n= 54) が確認された。更に,九倍性の株(2 n= 82) が,六倍性の集団で 1 個体であるが,今回初めて見い出された。六倍体は関東地方の中心域から関東地方より北部の地域に広く分布し,その分布域の週辺部には二倍体と四倍体が生育しており,稀には二倍体と共存していた。四倍体は六倍体の生育地よりも北部および北西部に広く分布していた。二,四および六倍体には,数が 1 ～ 6 個と変異するB染色体の付加による異数体が 25 集団で見い出された。六倍性シロヨメ(2 n= 54) とノコンギク(2 n= 36) の間の雑種(2 n= 45) が 5 集団で 6 個体見い出された。また,L^ -染色体の多型性を更に詳しく調べた結果,前回提唱した本染色体の多型性を区分する基準を少し修整し, 12 型を区別した。本染色体の多型性は,倍数性が高ければ高い程大きかった...|$|R

A negative result could be due to the DNA simply not being sampled due to low abundance or chance, or it could mean tilapia are not present at the site. All quality control measures (i. e. negative samples, equipment controls and negative PCR controls) were clear of contamination in the current survey.

Lophiostoma andLophiotrema possess the same definition of ascospores. Consequently, species in thesegenera are actually in a mixture. However, mycologists, who encounter ascomycetes withbitunicate asci and hyaline septate ascospores, usually can not find the names for them andmerely attribute them as Massarina-like ascomycetes, because {{it is difficult to}} identify themto species, even genus level. Identification of Massarina-like fungi always frustratesmycologists. Species of Massarina-like species are ubiquitous and mainly saprophytic onwood. There are 18 Massarina-like species obtained in Tawian, most of which can not beassigned to any extant species, and are considered to be new species.

40|$|The {{principal}} aims of {{this study}} were to develop a GIS for the collection and modelling of beach characteristics which influence selection of nest sites by marine turtles on the north east Arnhem Land coast. Additionally, the association between the proximity of human settlements and probability of a site being used for nesting was examined. The study involved the use of aerial photography, other data collected by remote sensing, and existing GIS coverages to characterise mainland nesting beaches between Cape Wilberforce and Cape Shield in north east Arnhem Land. Beaches on numerous small rocky islands were difficult to characterise with available data and were not mapped. Nesting data from aerial and ground surveys collected between 1993 and 1999 by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT was used to map the presence of nesting throughout the study area. A total of 224 beaches was identified with a total length of 355 km, representing 55 % of the coastline in the study area. Nesting activity occurred on 61 beaches which covered a total length of 150 km. Data limitations required the use of a binomial response variable, defined as the presence or absence of nesting activity by a mix of species recorded at least once over the seven years <b>of</b> <b>survey.</b> Logistic regression analysis was used to derive a model relating the probability of a beach being used by nesting marine turtles to the physical characteristics that could be derived from small scale remotely sensed and GIS data. A parsimonious model was produced with beach exposure and length of beaches, accounting for approximately 30 % of the variation in nesting activity. Increased exposure of beaches to open sea was significantly associated with nesting activity.  This is interpreted as evidence that nesting females choose exposed beaches that offer access to open sea currents which may increase survivorship of hatchlings by minimising energy expenditure to reach feeding areas. An examination of the proximity of settlements to nesting beaches using Euclidean distance showed a significant negative association with the presence of nesting when entered alone into a model. However, when entered into a model with exposure of beaches it did not add significantly to the explained variance. This is interpreted as a product of intercorrelation between exposure of beaches and proximity of settlements. Settlements are typically found on sheltered bays, where choices made to site outstations are based on values unrelated to turtle nesting activity. The methods used to develop models to determine suitable nesting beaches have scope for adaptation <b>to</b> guide <b>further</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>of</b> nest distribution and abundance. The GIS produced in this study will provide indigenous land managers in north east Arnhem Land with a planning tool for management of nesting beaches in the region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMyoD-deficient mice {{are without}} obvious {{deleterious}} muscle phenotype during embryogenesis and fetal development, and {{adults in the}} laboratory have grossly normal skeletal muscle and life span. However, a previous study showed that {{in the context of}} muscle degeneration on a mdx (dystrophin null) genetic background, animals lacking MyoD have a greatly intensified disease phenotype leading to lethality not otherwise seen in mdx mice. Here we have examined MyoD−/− adult muscle fibers and their associated satellite cells in single myofiber cultures and describe major phenotypic differences found at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. The steady-state number of satellite cells on freshly isolated MyoD−/− fibers was elevated and abnormal branched fiber morphologies were observed, the latter suggesting chronic muscle regeneration in vivo. Single-cell RNA coexpression analyses were performed for c-met, m-cadherin, and the four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs.) Most mutant satellite cells entered the cell cycle and upregulated expression of myf 5, both characteristic early steps in satellite cell maturation. However, they later failed to normally upregulate MRF 4, displayed a major deficit in m-cadherin expression, and showed a significant diminution in myogenin-positive status compared with wildtype. MyoD−/− satellite cells formed unusual aggregate structures, failed to fuse efficiently, and showed greater than 90 % reduction in differentiation efficiency relative <b>to</b> wildtype. A <b>further</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> RNAs encoding regulators of growth and differentiation, cell cycle progression, and cell signaling revealed similar or identical expression profiles for most genes as well as several noteworthy differences. Among these, GDF 8 and Msx 1 were identified as potentially important regulators of the quiescent state whose expression profile differs between mutant and wildtype. Considered together, these data suggest that activated MyoD−/− satellite cells assume a phenotype that resembles in some ways a developmentally “stalled” cell compared to wildtype. However, the MyoD−/− cells are not merely developmentally immature, as they also display novel molecular and cellular characteristics that differ from any observed in wild-type muscle precursor counterparts of any stage...|$|R
