25|$|The {{construction}} of Nexus, a secret military communication centre in Karen, Nairobi. The Government spent Sh2.6 billion (US$36.9 million) {{to construct the}} complex. Three years later, military personnel have not moved into the centre. A phantom company, Nedermar BV Technologies, which {{is said to have}} its headquarters in the Netherlands, implemented the secret project situated along Karen South Road. Nedermar is linked to businessman Anura Pereira. However, Pereira has denied this. The tendering process for the Nexus project was circumvented as DoD's Departmental <b>Tender</b> <b>Committee.</b> Funding for the project was made through the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The complex is currently headed by Colonel Philip Kameru. Nexus was first meant to be an ammunition dumpsite before it was turned into a military communication and operations centre. Construction continued without any site visits by either the DoD staff or Ministry of Public Works officials. The Nexus project was implemented during the tenure of General Joseph Kibwana.|$|E

40|$|According to {{the rules}} of the current Government Procurement Law in Taiwan, the most {{advantageous}} tender is often determined based on the sum of ranks among all tenders. This method is criticized, however, for its violating the basic propositions of the measurement theory, being easily biased by a few members in the evaluation Committee, and lack of distinct bases to discriminate the evaluation differences among the Committee members. The improved procedure suggested in this study, which is based on fuzzy relations and adopts eigenvector method, conforms to the judgment principles as well as the measurement theory. With analysis of a procurement case, the results demonstrate that the improved procedure is able to use quantitative methods to identify the evaluation differences among individual Committee members.

Consequently, multi-criteria evaluation schemes, such as the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) scheme, are often used by <b>tendering</b> <b>committees</b> in public projects. The used procedure has to meet the requirements of full transparency and to assure competitiveness among bidders. Many MEAT award related models have been proposed in the specialized literature. This paper presents a classification of these models. Their strength and weakness are illustrated. The assessment of some of these models builds upon their application to an example of public procurement. The presented analysis can be used by Governments and public firms in the selection of the tendering mechanism that best meets their requirements, needs and expectations in bid evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} system {{has become one}} of the centerpieces in the functioning of organizations hence the importance of an IT (Information Technology) master plan to manage its development. To find a provider for the IT master plan’s realization, organizations are increasingly using tendering as the mode of awarding contracts. This article focuses on the use of multi-criteria decision-making method AHP for analysis and evaluation of tenders during the awarding of contracts of IT master plan’s realization. To achieve this goal, a painstaking work was realized, on the one hand, for making an inventory of criteria and sub-criteria involved in the evaluation of bids and on the other hand for specifying the degrees of preference for each pair of criteria and each pair of sub-criteria. Finally, a test was performed by using fictitious tenders. The goals of this work are to make available to members of <b>tenders</b> <b>committee</b> a decision support tool for evaluating tenders of IT master plan’s realization submitted by bidders and endow the organizations with effective IT master plans in order to increase the performance of their information systems...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of emerging black entrepreneurs on their ability to access government contract work with special reference to that outsourced by the Department of Economic Development and Tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal. The study was based on the assumption that black emerging entrepreneurs are side lined by the procurement systems and processes of government, despite the fact when the new government took over after the democratic elections of 1994, it formulated legislation and policies and provided institutional framework to ensure that enterprises belonging to entrepreneurs of African descent in particular were brought into the economic mainstream activities of the country. The study utilized an exploratory description research design owing to publicity of literature on the effectiveness of government's procurement intervention strategies in addressing the needs of emerging black entrepreneurs. The study used two samples drawn from two research populations. In the first sample the population consisted of thirty-two tender submissions that emerging black entrepreneurs forwarded to the Department of Economic Development and Tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal, in response to contract work or tenders advertised and evaluated by the <b>Tender</b> Evaluation <b>Committee</b> and the <b>Tender</b> Award <b>Committee</b> of the Department during the financial year 2001 / 2. An instrument was developed to elicit data from the tender documents for the purpose of orders. In the second sample the research population consisted of sixteen emerging black entrepreneurs whose tender documents submitted in response to the tenders outsourced by the Department during the financial year 2001 / 2 were evaluated by the Department's <b>Tender</b> Evaluation <b>Committee</b> and <b>tender</b> Award <b>Committee</b> during the period in question. The questionnaire was used to elicit information on the perceptions of emerging black entrepreneurs with regard to their level of participation in the procurement process of the Department. The findings of the study are supportive of the guiding questions and assumptions advanced for the purpose of focusing the study. The finding was that black emerging entrepreneurs perceived themselves to be non-participants in the procurement activities of the Department. The study also found the existence of structural problem, which acted as barriers to active participation, of black emerging entrepreneurs, in the outsourcing activities of the Department of Economic Development and Tourism in the Province of KwaZulu-Natal...|$|R
50|$|He {{was asked}} by the Party general {{secretary}} to prepare the strategies, formulate policies and provide leadership for the Suva City Council elections in November 1985. Initial press reports and Party pamphlets showed that Sukhdeo was providing the lead for the Party candidates, particularly in the Samabula ward. It was just before the elections that a Labour candidate, Michael Dutta withdrew as he was migrating to Australia. This provided the opportunity for Bob Kumar to seek Management Board’s approval for his Samabula candidacy. The Party immersed itself into an electioneering mode at ground level and received wholesome support in Samabula and Muanikau Wards. The Labour candidates thrashed NFP and Alliance candidates in Samabula Ward, once regarded as a blue ribbon constituency for the National Federation Party. It was the first nail in NFP’s coffin. Sukhdeo was well groomed to take the helm of the Council, but the Party bypassed him in favour of Bob Kumar, the Party Treasurer a late comer to Suva City Council electioneering. Sukhdeo was then elected as the Party Whip and Chairman of the sensitive <b>Tender</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 28 September, Wheatley's {{independent}} review was published, recommending that an independent organisation with government and regulator representation, called the <b>Tender</b> <b>Committee,</b> manage {{the process of}} setting LIBOR under a new external oversight process for transparency and accountability. Banks that make submissions to LIBOR {{would be required to}} base them on actual inter-bank deposit market transactions and keep records of their transactions supporting those submissions. The review also recommended that individual banks' LIBOR submissions be published, but only after three months, to reduce the risk that they would be used as a measure of the submitting banks' creditworthiness. The review left open the possibility that regulators might compel additional banks to participate in submissions if an insufficient number do voluntarily. The review recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates such as the LIBOR, saying that existing criminal regulations for manipulation of financial instruments were inadequate. LIBOR rates may be higher and more volatile after implementation of these reforms, so financial institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs.

The matter went back and forth to the Regional and Supreme courts for over a year, with a second lawsuit filed by Minrab, another company which lost the tender.

Should the court eventually rule in favor of Minrab, the National Roads Company will be required to compensate Minrab. The tender stated that the works would last 36 months, meaning that the road would be completed in late 2013, at best.|$|R
