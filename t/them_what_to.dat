25|$|At 0605 {{the next}} day, 2d Company, 7th ARVN Regiment, {{moved into the}} village. Loudspeakers were used to reassure the villagers, advising <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and {{providing}} a means of control. While the external cordon remained in place, 2d Company soldiers established additional cordon lines to further divide the village into three sections. Search forces from Bình Dương Province were brought in to screen the village. The force had been adapted to fit the needs of this operation and contained {{many different types of}} units.|$|E
25|$|Khamenei issues decrees {{and makes}} the final {{decisions}} on economy, environment, foreign policy and everything else in Iran. Khamenei regularly meets with president, cabinet members, head and officials of the judiciary branch, parliamentarians, among others, and tells <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Khamenei has also fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. Khamenei meets with foreign dignitaries, however he does not travel overseas; if anyone wishes to see him, that person must travel to Iran. Apart from his time in Najaf as a student, Khamenei travelled to Libya during his time as President.|$|E

25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she sat alone in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E
500|$|The Coens {{edited the}} film themselves, as is their custom. [...] "We prefer a {{hands-on}} approach," [...] Joel explained in 1996, [...] "rather than {{sitting next to}} someone and telling <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> cut." [...] Because of rules for membership in film production guilds, {{they are required to}} use a pseudonym; [...] "Roderick Jaynes" [...] is credited with editing Barton Fink. Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the movie, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited out because they were [...] "too conventional".|$|E
500|$|As they read, the relatives' {{worst fears}} are soon realised; Buoso has indeed bequeathed his fortune to the monastery. They {{break out in}} woe and indignation and turn to Simone, the oldest present and a former mayor of Fucecchio, but he can offer no help. Rinuccio {{suggests}} that only Gianni Schicchi can advise <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, but this is scorned by Zita and the rest, who sneer at Schicchi's humble origins and now say that marriage to the daughter of such a peasant {{is out of the}} question. Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria [...] "Avete torto" [...] (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to [...] "be off" [...] and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will {{have nothing to do with}} such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.|$|E

2500|$|At the Red Guard rallies, Lin Biao {{also called}} for the {{destruction}} of the [...] "Four Olds"; namely, old customs, culture, habits, and ideas. Lin's speeches, heavy on rhetoric but light on details, did not specify what needed to be [...] "destroyed" [...] as part of this campaign. Mao believed that in creating [...] "great disorder", the masses should organically steer the direction of the movement rather than rely on the authorities to tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. As a result, the movement quickly spun out of control.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{purchased}} the Victoria Times Colonist in 1959 for $750,000, {{and one year}} later built a plant to print both the Times and The Colonist, which he gained control of in 1953 for $1 million. In 1954, Bell acquired a controlling interest in the Lethbridge Herald. He {{had a habit of}} appearing unannounced at the offices of his papers, often to chat with the editors, but never told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> print. Bell continued to acquire newspapers, joining with Victor Sifton, owner of the Winnipeg Free Press to purchase the Ottawa Journal in 1959. The pair combined their interests to form FP (Federated Paper) Publications Ltd. that same year. Bell {{purchased the}} Vancouver Sun in 1963, and Toronto's Globe and Mail in 1965, making FP Publications Canada's largest newspaper syndicate. [...] By 1972, the papers had a combined circulation of over 820,000.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1963, {{the terms}} of six of the seven members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts expired. Kennedy had already {{appointed}} landscape architect Hideo Sasaki, to the commission in 1962. Kennedy privately criticized the Eisenhower commission for [...] "spread a mantle of mediocrity and middle age over the city", and he was now determined to remake the CFA into a body that would promote modern ideas of art and architecture. Walton advised Kennedy on who to appoint to the CFA. The new commissioners included architect Gordon Bunshaft, architect Burnham Kelly, architect John Carl Warnecke (a friend of the Kennedys), sculptor Theodore Roszak, and art critic Aline B. Saarinen. Although Walton himself did not lobby for a position, Kennedy named him to the commission as well. Kennedy warned him, however, that the administration had limited political capital to spend on the arts and that Walton should never put Kennedy {{in a position where}} the president would have {{to go out on a}} limb to rescue him. Walton's chairmanship was easy-going. His leadership style was informal and collegial, and he pushed the commission to shape and prod designers rather than tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E

2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign if I told <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them say exactly what they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he [...] "never once agreed with an editorial they have published", was the highest paid journalist of his era.|$|E
2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that the sky is falling. [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that the sky is falling, leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E

Just teach 'em with the left foot and don't tell <b>'em</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the right foot until they pay up!" [...] Murray thought about Bryan's remark, and devised the idea of teaching dance steps with footprint diagrams supplied by mail. Within a couple of years, over 500,000 dance courses had been sold.|$|R

6000|$|Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. [...] "Lecoq was {{a miserable}} bungler," [...] he said, in an angry voice; [...] "he {{had only one}} thing to {{recommend}} him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach <b>them</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> avoid." ...|$|E

60|$|The slaves {{had been}} treated so cruelly by the {{servants}} of King Gos that they were eager to pursue and slay them, in revenge; but Inga held them back and formed them into companies, each company having its own leader.

60|$|The cobbler did {{not know}} what to make of these strange words; but he was wiser than many people, and when he did not understand, he thought it was well to obey.
