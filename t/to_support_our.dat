It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>our</b> Christians.

They won't be able to find their way home, and we shall thus be rid of them." [...] "No, wife," [...] said her husband, [...] "that I won't do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in the wood? The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces." [...] "Oh! you fool," [...] said she, [...] "then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well go and plane the boards for our coffins"; and she left him no peace till he consented.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple method for {{assigning}} graded relevance values to documents judged {{during the course}} of a retrieval experiment. In making this proposal, we aim to avoid the potential for ambiguity and greater cognitive load associated with standard graded relevance judgments. Under our pro-posal, we first decompose a retrieval topic into a number of informational nuggets. For each document, a binary judg-ment is made with respect to each nugget. The ratio of rele-vant nuggets to total nuggets becomes the graded relevance value assigned to that document. <b>To</b> provide <b>support</b> for this idea, we turn to test collections created for the TREC Web Track. Along with the usual graded relevance judg-ments required by traditional effectiveness measures, these test collections include topic decompositions created for the purpose of evaluating novelty and diversity. By exploiting these test collections for our own purposes, we demonstrate a clear relationship between our proposed method and tradi-tional graded relevance. In addition <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>our</b> pro-posal, our experiments suggest that informational nuggets can provide a unified approach to relevance assessment, sup-porting both traditional effectiveness measures and newer measures of novelty and diversity...|$|R
6000|$|It was necessary, on our part, {{that the}} natural {{government}} should show itself worthy of that name. It was necessary, at the crisis I speak of, that the supreme {{power of the state}} should meet the conciliatory dispositions of the subject. To delay protection would be to reject allegiance. And why should it be rejected, or even coldly and suspiciously received? If any independent Catholic state should choose to take part with this kingdom in a war with France and Spain, that bigot (if such a bigot could be found) would be heard with little respect, who could dream of objecting his religion to an ally whom the nation would not only receive with its freest thanks, but purchase with the last remains of its exhausted treasure. To such an ally we should not dare to whisper a single syllable of those base and invidious topics upon which some unhappy men would persuade the state to reject the duty and allegiance of its own members. Is it, then, because foreigners are in a condition to set our malice at defiance, that with them we are willing to contract engagements of friendship, and to keep them with fidelity and honor, but that, because we conceive some descriptions of our countrymen are not powerful enough to punish our malignity, we will not permit them <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>our</b> common interest? Is it on that ground that our anger is to be kindled by their offered kindness? Is it on that ground that they are to be subjected to penalties, because they are willing by actual merit to purge themselves from imputed crimes? Lest by an adherence to the cause of their country they should acquire a title to fair and equitable treatment, are we resolved to furnish them with causes of eternal enmity, and rather supply them with just and founded motives to disaffection than not to have that disaffection in existence to justify an oppression which, not from policy, but disposition, we have predetermined to exercise? ...|$|E
6000|$|Praying, hearing, reading; {{for what}} are these things ordained, but that we might by the godly use of them attain to more of the {{knowledge}} of God, and be strengthened by his grace to serve him better according to his moral law? Baptism, fellowship, and the Lord's supper, are ordained for these ends also. But there is a vast difference between using of these things, and a using of them for these ends. A man may pray, yea pray for such things, had he them, as would make him better in morals, without desire to be better in morals, or love to the things he prays for. A man may read and hear, not to learn to do, though to know; yea he may be dead to doing moral goodness, and yet be great for reading and hearing all his days. The people then among all professors that are zealous of good works are the peculiar ones to Christ. (Titus 2:14) What has a man done that is baptized, if he pursues not the ends for which that appointment was ordained. The like I say of fellowship, of breaking of bread, etc.. For all these things we should use <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>our</b> faith, to mortify the flesh, and strengthen us to walk in newness of life by {{the rule of the}} moral law. Nor can that man be esteemed holy whose life is tainted with immoralities, let him be what he can in all things else. I am of that man's mind as to practical righteousness, who said to Christ upon this very question, 'Well, master, thou hast said the truth;--for to love the Lord our God with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.' (Mark 12:28-33) To love my neighbour as myself, to do as I would be done unto, this is the law and the prophets. And he that is altogether a stranger to these things, how dwelleth the love of God in him; or how will he manifest to another that his faith will save him? ...|$|E

I had vainly hoped that when the Scottish nobles saw what great things the commonalty were able to do, and how far, alone and unaided, they had cleared Scotland of her tyrants, they would have joined us with their vassals; but you see it is not so. The successes that I have gained have but excited their envy against me. Of them all only Grahame, Stewart, and Macduff stood by my side, while all the great earls and barons either held aloof or were, like Bruce, {{in the ranks of}} Edward's army, or like Comyn and his friends, joined me solely to betray me. I am convinced now that it is only a united Scotland can resist the power of England, and it is certain that so long as I remain here Scotland never can be united. Of Bruce I have no longer any hope; but if I retire Comyn may take the lead, and many at least of the Scottish nobles will follow him. Had we but horsemen and archers <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>our</b> spearmen, I would not fear the issue; but it is the nobles alone who can place mounted men-at-arms in the field. Of bowmen we must always be deficient, seeing that our people take not naturally to this arm as do the English; but with spearmen to break the first shock of English chivalry, and with horsemen to charge them when in confusion, we may yet succeed, but horsemen we shall never get so long as the nobles hold aloof. It is useless to try and change my decision, my friends. Sore grief though it will be to me to sheathe my sword and to stand aloof when Scotland struggles for freedom, I am convinced that only by my doing so has Scotland a chance of ultimate success in the struggle. Do not make it harder for me by your pleadings. I have thought long over this, and my mind is made up. My heart is well nigh broken by the death of my dear friend and brother in arms, Sir John Grahame, and I feel able to struggle no longer against the jealousy and hostility of the Scottish nobles." ...|$|E

Current state of the art methods require up to twice as much bisection bandwidth as this theoretical minimum. We propose a set of optimized exchanges that use exactly the minimum amount of resources and exhibit close to ideal performance.
