Yagnavalakya {{put an end to}} the debate by telling Gargi not to proceed further as other wise she would lose her mental balance. This riposte {{put an end to the}}ir further {{dialogue}} at the conference of the learned. However, at the end of the debate she conceded to the superior knowledge of Yajnavalkya by saying: [...] "venerable Brahmins, you may consider it a great thing if you get off bowing before him. No one, I believe, will defeat him in any argument concerning Brahman." ...|$|E

There, he meets by chance Countess Ruby von Treck (Norma Shearer), an American-born widow, but she also {{does not want to}} become involved, at least at first. <b>Then,</b> <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> her lover, General Kurt von Kolb (Conrad Veidt), about Emmy and learns that she has been judged a traitor in a secret trial and sentenced to death.|$|R
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ron (Nick Offerman) head up to Indianapolis {{to receive}} a {{commendation}} at the Indiana Statehouse for reestablishing the Pawnee Harvest Festival, although Ron is only interested in eating at Charles Mulligan's Steak House, his favorite restaurant. Ann (Rashida Jones) tells Leslie her last talk with Chris (Rob Lowe) reassured her their relationship was fine, {{but he has been}} acting distant since <b>then.</b> <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> Leslie to look for signs of whether Chris is cheating on her, since he has since returned to Indianapolis.|$|R
60|$|She {{explained}} {{the whole thing}} to me, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> if I wouldn't intercede with you. I promised to do everything I could.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes. Eaten {{out with}} listlessness. She's neither sick nor sorry, but how dull and dreary she is, only herself can tell. When I {{get there in}} the morning, there she is sitting up in bed, for my lady don't care to get up; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> makes me bring this book and that book, till the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her, making her look, as she leans upon her elbow, like the stoning of Stephen. <b>She</b> yawns; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> looks towards the tall glass; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> {{looks out at the}} weather, mooning her great black eyes, and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my tongue goes flick-flack along, a hundred and fifty words a minute; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> looks at the clock; <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> me what I've been reading.' ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> him playfully {{whether he}} had not had any love affairs at Heidelberg. Without thinking, he frankly {{answered}} that he had not; but she refused to believe him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Is this, <b>then,</b> love?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> herself; and <b>she</b> {{found time}} to slip into her own room {{for a moment and}} arrange her dishevelled hair, ere she entered the breakfast-room.|$|R
