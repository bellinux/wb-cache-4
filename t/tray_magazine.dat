5000|$|Parallel to {{the camera}} {{manufacturing}} began the development and construction of film slide projectors. In 1955, under the Carl Braun Camera-Werk Nürnberg label, the company introduced {{one of the first}} semi-automatic slide projectors with a <b>tray</b> <b>magazine</b> to the consumer market named Paximat. [...] Other innovations included wired or wireless remote control, automatic focus, brighter halogen lamps, and variable brightness control. Since 1955, about 4 million slide projectors have been built and sold in 120 countries around the world under the names Paximat or Novamat.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{photographic}} slide projectors, notably {{those made}} by Kodak until 2004, used rotating <b>trays</b> or <b>magazines</b> called carousels to hold the slides and were often known as [...] "carousel projectors." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon is}} fed from the {{left-hand}} side by disintegrating-link M27 ammunition belts (a miniaturized version of the 7.62mm M13 belt), from either an unsupported loose belt, enclosed in a polymer ammunition box with a 200-round capacity attached {{to the base of}} the receiver, or from detachable STANAG magazines, used in other NATO 5.56 mm assault rifles such as the M16 and FNC. Magazine feeding is used only as an auxiliary measure, when belted ammunition has been exhausted. The ammunition belt is introduced into the feed <b>tray,</b> <b>magazines</b> are seated inside the magazine port at a 45° angle, located beneath the feed tray port. When a belt is placed in the feed tray it covers the magazine port. Likewise, a magazine inserted into the magazine well will prevent the simultaneous insertion of a belt. The magazine port, when not in use, is closed with an L-shaped hinged flap equipped with a tooth, which engages a corresponding opening in the magazine and serves as a magazine release. This feature was developed by FN's Maurice V. Bourlet and allows the Minimi to be instantly changed from belt feed to magazine feed without any modification.|$|R
40|$|Dr Jüri Kermik {{from the}} Design and Craft Programme, Faculty of Arts, was invited guest {{exhibitor}} at the EcoDesign 2011 exhibition in Finland (14 - 18 September). EcoDesign is a prestigious annual event launched in 2009 and held {{as part of}} the Helsinki Design Week. The theme of the 3 rd International EcoDesign was MultiFunction. The exhibition presented ecological and multifunctional furniture from 100 internationally recognized designers from 11 countries including Shigeru Ban, Karim Rashid, Eero Aarnio and Björn Dahlström. Kermik’s design STANDPOINT minimises the amount of material and parts but extends the degree of multifunctionality through detailing, modularity and options for assembly. STANDPOINT utilises only four inter-connectable components for a maximum adjustability. Rather than attempting to define a fixed proposition, Kermik invites the user to create an object to be acted upon. Component parts: four wooden interconnectable and adjustable arms/legs, tray(s) and a box. Compatibles: lampshades, coat hangers, hooks, umbrellas, tools, instruments, clothes, books, maps, flowers, candles etc. Combinations: tripod, easel, stick-leg stand, pedestal, lampstand, crutch, sewing stand, display cabinet, telescope mount, workstand, trestle, plant stand, display stand, deadman, drinks cabinet, cake stand, leg, standard lamp, prop, sawhorse, coat hanger, clothes rack, buttress, music stand, bracket, stick measure, straight edge, mirror stand, notice board, tool box, tool rack, book case, adjustable square, compass, stilt, sign support, gun mount, bookstand, <b>tray</b> stand, <b>magazine</b> rack, key cabinet, valet stand, umbrella stand, candlestand, trivet, navigator’s level...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, {{remarkable}} afforts have been made for the ralization of microscale sensors, actuators and microelectromechanical systems. Due to advances in solid state and micromachining technologies, significant advances in designing, fabricating and testing of microminiaturized devices have been achieved at laboratory level. However, the technical and economical realization of microelectromechanical systems is considerably impeded {{by the lack of}} satisfying device technology for their industrial production. A production concept for the industrial production of hybrid microelectromechanical systems was developed and investigated. The concept is based on the resources and requirements of medium-sized enterprises and is characterized by its flexibility. Microsystem fab rication is separated into mecrofabrication steps performed in-house and tehcnological steps performed by external technology providers. The modularity of the concept allows for a gradual increase in the degree of automatison and the in-house production depth, depending on market capacity and financial resources. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the design and realization of a microfabrication process center, which includes tasks like transport and handling, processing, cleaning, testing and storing are discussed. Special attention is given to the supply and feeding of micropartsa, to the necessary <b>magazines,</b> <b>trays</b> and transport systems, to the implementation of homogeneous mechanical, environmental and information interfaces, to the employment of advanced control, scheduling, and lot tracking concepts, and to the application of highly modular and cost-efficient clean production concepts...|$|R
