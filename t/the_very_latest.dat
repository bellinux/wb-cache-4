5|$|After several modifications, {{the first}} {{production}} variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most {{closely associated with}} the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp. Lancasters were known to fly entire missions with their engines running at full power with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} has a {{matching}} , with windows of equal value {{to those on}} the first floor below. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), {{as one of the most}} important inventions of his day.|$|E

The two most striking of these are around Lanercost east of Carlisle and around Torquhan south of Edinburgh.

25|$|The Medians {{took control}} of Elam during this period. Cyaxares {{the king of the}} Medes, Persians, Parthians and Sagartians entered into an {{alliance}} with a coalition of fellow former vassals of Assyria; Nabopolassar of Babylon and Chaldea, and also the Scythians and Cimmerians against Sin-shar-ishkun of Assyria, who was faced with unremitting civil war in Assyria itself. This alliance then attacked a disunited and war weakened Assyria, and between 616 BC and 599 BC at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest,</b> had conquered its vast empire which stretched from the Caucasus Mountains to Egypt, Libya and the Arabian Peninsula, and from Cyprus and Ephesus to Persia and the Caspian Sea.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few archaeological sources {{contemporaneous}} with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to witness a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block {{at the end of}} the corridor leading down to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription is likely to refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest.</b> Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such a clay seals bearing his Horus name.|$|E
25|$|Cameron's generalship in New Zealand was, {{with minor}} exceptions, {{of a very}} high standard. In particular, he was a general who welcomed new ideas and {{technology}} and quickly put them into action. Cameron ordered prefabricated, steel-clad gunboats from Australia, which were assembled and finished in New Zealand. Both the gunboats and the army were equipped with <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> Armstrong artillery, which were light, mobile, very accurate and fired an explosive shell. He appreciated the importance of irregular troops and allowed {{the creation of the}} Forest Rangers, who had their own unique organisation, uniform and lightweight arms including Bowie knives, revolvers and breech-loading carbines. In 1862, the telegram was first introduced to New Zealand, 18 years after its invention by Morse, and in 1863 a military telegraph was built from Auckland to Drury and later extended to the Waikato, allowing rapid communication between the front and Auckland. Cameron was quick to realise the importance of local knowledge and used Gorst, a missionary from the Waikato who spoke the Māori language, as a guide. He also used Waikato Māori who remained loyal to the crown as guides and to man a redoubt at Rangiriri once the Kingites had been defeated. A kūpapa Māori, familiar with the shallow waters of the Waikato Heads was used to guide the first gunboats through the Waikato River shoals. Cameron appreciated the importance of the surface coal seams at Huntly, which he used as fuel for his gunboats and supply steamers.|$|E

Merycopotamus, Libycosaurus and all hippopotamids can be considered to form a clade, with Libycosaurus being {{more closely related to}} hippos.

500|$|Records of {{the latter}} part of the {{campaign}} were discovered on the tomb walls of a participating soldier, Ahmose, son of Ebana. These records indicate that Ahmose I led three attacks against Avaris, the Hyksos capital, but also had to quell a small rebellion further south in [...] Egypt. After this, in the fourth attack, he conquered the city. He completed his victory over the Hyksos by conquering their stronghold Sharuhen near Gaza after a three-year siege. Ahmose would have conquered Avaris by the 18th or 19th year of his reign at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest.</b> [...] This is suggested by [...] "a graffito in the quarry at Tura whereby 'oxen from Canaan' were used at the opening of the quarry in Ahmose's regnal year 22." [...] Since the cattle would probably have been imported after Ahmose's siege of the [...] town of Sharuhen which followed the fall of Avaris, this means that the reign of Khamudi must have terminated by Year 18 or 19 of Ahmose's 25-year reign at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest.</b>|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} that Robert Grosvenor, then the 2ndEarl Grosvenor, and later the 1stMarquess of Westminster, {{inherited}} the estate in 1802, the Samwell Hall had become old-fashioned {{and in need of}} renovation.

[...] Building started in 1803 and Porden (later assisted by Porden's son-in-law Joseph Kay) estimated it would take three years to build at a cost of £10,000 (...) [...] [...] In the event it took just under 10 years and cost over £100,000 (...) [...] [...] The previous house was encased and surrounded by [...] "every possible permutation of the gothic style"; including turrets, pinnacles, arched windows, octagonal towers, and buttresses (both regular and flying). [...] Two new wings were added in the first stage, and in the 1820s more wings were added, by this time under the direction of Benjamin Gummow. [...] The interior of the house was as lavish as the exterior, with more Gothic detailing. [...] The hangings for the state bed included [...] of purple damask and [...] of sarsenet (fine silk) trimmed with gold lace. [...] When the future Queen Victoria visited in 1832 at the age of 13, she wrote in her journal: [...] "The house is magnificent". [...] Others described it as being [...] "as extravagant and opulent as <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> upholsterer-decorators could make it". [...] A critic found it [...] "the most gaudy concern I ever saw" [...] and [...] "a vast pile of mongrel gothic which... is a monument of wealth, ignorance and bad taste". [...] Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, succeeded his father in 1845 and commissioned the Scottish architect William Burn to make alterations to the house. [...] Burn raised the centre of the south front {{to make it look like}} a tower, and changed some of the external Gothic features. [...] The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described this house as a [...] "spectacular Gothic mansion".|$|E

40|$|Eighteen {{genes of}} Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} are {{necessary}} and sufficient to transactivate expression from the late vp 39 promoter in transient-expression assays in SF- 21 cells. These 18 genes, known as late expression factor genes (lefs), are also required to transactivate <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>late</b> promoter of <b>the</b> polyhedrin gene, polh, but expression from this promoter is relatively weak compared with expression from the vp 39 promoter. To further define the factors required for <b>late</b> and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> promoter expression, we first determined that the eighteen lefs were also required for expression from two other major baculovirus promoters: the late basic 6. 9 -kDa protein gene, p 6. 9, and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>late</b> 10 -kDa protein gene, p 10.
