In June 2017, Bethesda announced a standalone spinoff, , which was released on 15 September 2017.|$|E
5|$|The teaser {{poster of}} Kaminey was {{received}} positively by critics. The trailer, which introduces four characters; one lisping, one stuttering, a woman yelling about having raped {{a man and}} one jeering at the lisper, received positive reviews. Critics kept <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> high due to Bhardwaj's previous films, and said the trailer was like a comic book which introduces the characters of Kapoor and Chopra differently. The theatrical trailers and the music generated interest for the film. The film's marketing also involved public appearances by Chopra and Kapoor.|$|E

5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks the boys {{to join him in}} becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of <b>their</b> <b>expectations.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, Capcom {{announced}} they expected {{the game to}} sell 7 million copies {{by the end of}} the 2012 fiscal year, however the company lowered <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> to 6 million due to the game's mixed reception. Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company. In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States. According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their financial projections for the fiscal year as a result. The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013, and, by October the same year, had sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E

They are erected indoors (3, 5, 9) or outdoors (2, 4, 6). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft (10). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by <b>their</b> <b>expectations,</b> the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.|$|E
5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> and added more levels that repeated.|$|E

30|$|Consumers may acquire <b>their</b> <b>{{expectation}}</b> through word-of-mouth, experience, {{and social}} media (Anderson and Fornell 2000). Consumers’ expectation can be predicted and observed {{with regard to}} beliefs and the reliability regarding products or services (Lee et al. 2014). For example, consumers who are dissatisfied with apparel products hold fewer expectation when exposed to negative word-of-mouth as well as exhibiting less repurchasing behavior with the product (Richins 1983). Also, consumers increasingly expect retail brands to behave in line with ethical fashion practices, because <b>their</b> <b>expectation</b> has formed a reference point for their evaluation of socially responsible business practices and eco-products to develop favorable or unfavorable attitude towards retail brands (Creyer and Ross 1997).|$|R

5|$|In 2006, Australia sent 40 {{athletes to}} compete in 10 sports. It was {{a record number of}} {{competitors}} and events, and Australian officials publicly declared <b>their</b> <b>expectations</b> of medal success. Aerial skiing medal hopeful Lydia Ierodiaconou injured herself when she landed badly on the second qualification jump, while Jacqui Cooper, who placed first in the qualification round, crashed in both of her finals jumps. Camplin won bronze, her second Olympic medal. Dale Begg-Smith, considered the favourite in moguls skiing, won gold in the event. Torah Bright was rated as a medal chance in snowboarding half-pipe, and came fifth. Damon Hayler, rated as a medal chance in snowboard cross, came seventh. Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter less than two years earlier, was seen as a medal possibility in the skeleton, but inexperience with the intimidating and technical track contributed to her 13th place. As only eight teams competed in the men's short track speed skating relay, Australia had a good mathematical chance of winning a medal, but they failed to reach the final.|$|E
5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded <b>their</b> <b>expectations,</b> and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to go too far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E
