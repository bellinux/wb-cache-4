50|$|A sliding <b>T</b> <b>bevel,</b> {{also known}} as a bevel gauge or false square is an {{adjustable}} gauge for setting and transferring angles. The handle is usually made of wood or plastic and is connected to a metal blade with a thumbscrew or wing nut. The blade pivots and can be locked at any angle by loosening or tightening the thumbscrew.The bevel can be used to duplicate an existing angle, or set to a desired angle by using it with any number of other measuring tools (such as a protractor, or framing square).|$|E
40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} are {{important}} components on all current rotorcraft drive systems. These components {{are required to}} operate at high speeds, high loads, and for an extremely large number of load cycles. In this application, spiral bevel gears are used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Because of the high expense of manufacturing these gears, methods that can achieve {{the same level of}} performance at reduced cost are highly desirable to aerospace gear manufacturers. Gears manufactured for aerospace applications use high-quality materials and are manufactured to tight tolerances. Special manufacturing machine tools and computer numerically controlled coordinate measurement systems have enabled rotorcraft drive system manufacturers to produce extremely high-quality gears during their normal production. Because of low production rates for rotorcraft, these gears are manufactured in small batches, and thus are unable to benefit from the economics of high production numbers as in other industries. In this investigation, two different manufacturing methods, face-milled and face-hobbed, were used to fabricate spiral bevel gears. For face-milled spiral bevel gears, grinding of the contacting surfaces is the final manufacturing step. At least two different specialty machines are needed to generate the teeth for face-milled spiral bevel gears. For face-hobbed gears, hard cutting is the final manufacturing process. The same machine is used to rough cut and finish cut the gears. This study compared the operational behavior of face-milled spiral bevel gears with that of face-hobbed spiral <b>bevel</b> gears. <b>Test</b> hardware was manufactured to fit within NASA Glenn Research Center's Spiral <b>Bevel</b> <b>Test</b> Facility and to aerospace quality standards. Tests were conducted for stress, vibration, and noise. A comparison of the results attained indicated that the face-hobbed gears had a lower alternating stress level with a more even distribution of loading across the teeth, and slightly reduced levels of vibration and noise. Results of this study show that the face-hobbed method is a viable and lower-cost alternative for producing aerospace-quality spiral-bevel gears...|$|R
