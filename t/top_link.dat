The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. The entire class was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Mk1, and its Indy sister design the Mk2, closely {{followed}} the 38, with a riveted aluminium monocoque central section, carrying an unstressed engine mounted behind the driver. The lines of the chassis were remarkably clean and elegant, and the car sported a distinctively beaked radiator opening at the front. Suspension components were mounted directly on to this monocoque, and consisted of a comparatively conservative lower wishbone and single <b>top</b> <b>link</b> for each wheel which {{also served as a}} rocker for the inboard-mounted spring/damper package. The Mk1 was designed around the forthcoming Aubrey Woods-designed Weslake V12 engine while the Mk2, essentially the same chassis design, was designed to accept the quad-cam Ford V8 that had powered the previous year's Indy 500 winner (Jim Clark, in the Terry-designed Lotus 38).|$|E
500|$|Against {{the trend}} {{set by the}} Lotus 21 in 1961, the BT19's suspension, which {{controls}} the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and dampers are mounted {{in the space between}} the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel double wishbones. The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the Alford & Alder units used on the British Triumph Herald saloon. The rear suspension is formed by a single <b>top</b> <b>link,</b> a reversed lower wishbone and two radius rods locating cast magnesium alloy uprights. Wheels were initially 13inches (330mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to [...] at the rear, and later still 15in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes. Steel disc brakes are used on all four wheels and were of [...] diameter for the smaller wheels and [...] for the larger ones. The car ran on treaded Goodyear tyres throughout its racing career.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's him," [...] cried {{a man who}} was trouting on the {{opposite}} bank. Doubtless it was [...] "him," [...] but he had not touched the hook. I believe the correct thing would have been to wait for half an hour, and then try the fish with a smaller fly. But I had no smaller fly, no other fly at all. I stepped back a few paces, and fished down again. In Major Traherne's work I have read that the heart leaps, or stands still, or otherwise betrays an uncomfortable interest, when one casts for the second time over a salmon which has risen. I cannot honestly say that I suffered from this tumultuous emotion. [...] "He will not come again," [...] I said, when there was a long heavy drag at the line, followed by a shrieking of the reel, as in Mr. William Black's novels. Let it be confessed that the first hooking of a salmon is an excitement unparalleled in trout-fishing. There have been anglers who, when the salmon was once on, handed him over to the gillie to play and land. One would like to act as gillie to those lordly amateurs. My own fish rushed down stream, where the big tree stands. I had no hope of landing him if he took that course, because one could neither pass the rod under the boughs, nor wade out beyond them. But he soon came back, while one took in line, and discussed his probable size with the trout-fisher opposite. His size, indeed! Nobody knows what it was, for when he had come up to the point whence he had started, he began a policy of violent short tugs--not [...] "jiggering," [...] as it is called, but plunging with all his weight on the line. I had clean forgotten the slimness of the tackle, and, as he was clearly well hooked, held him perhaps too hard. Only a very raw beginner likes to take hours over landing a fish. Perhaps I held him too tight: at all events, after a furious plunge, back came the line; the casting line had snapped at the <b>top</b> <b>link.</b>|$|E

In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|E

5000|$|Yet another {{variation}} of short link design is the [...] "Switch link", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle {{is connected to}} the frame using an eccentric lower pivot, effectively creating a very short lower link whose length is that {{from the center of the}} eccentric to the attached pivot. The lower link would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the <b>top</b> <b>link</b> would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the <b>top</b> <b>link</b> rotated further it would move downwards reversing or [...] "Switching" [...] the lower link's direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the lower link has been replaced with a liner bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This liner bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel.|$|E

In the long run, the <b>top</b> five <b>links</b> contribute with 40.1  % of the total GDP effect (27.7  % in the short run); they are associated with transportation cost reductions within the Greater Cairo region (Cairo–Cairo, Cairo-Giza, and Giza-Cairo links) and better access to imports by Cairo and Menia.|$|R
5000|$|Lotus 59 {{originally}} came in two versions; 59 for Formula 3 and Formula Ford, 59B for Formula 2 and Formula B, all {{sharing the}} same 92.5" [...] wheelbase, which was 2.5" [...] longer than the previous 41/41X. Suspension was very conventional with double wishbone and outboard spring/damper unit up front, with <b>top</b> <b>link</b> and lower reversed wishbone combined with upper and lower radius arms and outboard spring/damper unit in the rear. Brakes were outboard {{in the front and}} rear.|$|E
50|$|The Lotus 22 was {{a racing}} car built by Lotus cars in 1962, {{and a total}} of 77 cars were built. It was {{developed}} from the 1962 Lotus 20, with the major differences that it had disc brakes all round, a <b>top</b> <b>link</b> and the 'rubber donut' to the rear suspension and a dry sump engine that was canted over to lower the centre of gravity. Also notable is the smoother bodywork covering the engine, compared to the boxy design of the 20.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, a {{differential}} lock, an {{hour meter}} and a padded seat were all added. During the same year, a second model (MK2) was released, featuring {{a more advanced}} hydraulic system. This allowed position control, based on the <b>top</b> <b>link</b> draft control, as well as mixing control. The Mk2 also saw some cost-cutting measures, such as the Bosch fuel injection being replaced by a lower performance Simms unit, as well as Lucas electrics replacing the Bosch. The 310D engine {{was replaced by a}} cheaper 310A unit. The most prominent exterior differences between the MK1 and MK2 are a spraying device, and a lifting device connected to the hand lever.|$|E

50|$|The Mark IV {{was built}} over the winter in 1962 and 1963. It {{featured}} a space frame chassis made of thin wall chrome-moly tubing. The body was clothed in aluminum and original powered by a modified Ford FJ engine mated to a Hewland MKIV five speed gearbox. In the front was a conventional upper and lower A-arm suspension setup, with a reversed lower A-arm and upper <b>top</b> <b>link</b> in the rear. Girling brakes, courtesy of a Lotus 21 F1 car, could be found at all four corners. The large fuel tank meant it could race more than the traditional 20 lap Formula Junior race.|$|E
50|$|The engine, gearbox {{and rear}} {{suspension}} were {{completely different from}} the standard Europa and were taken in their entirety from the Lotus 23/Lotus 22 Formula Junior with a Lotus-Ford Twin Cam based 165 hp (123 kW) 1,594 cc Cosworth Mk.XIII dry sump engine, and a Hewland FT 200 5-speed gearbox and suspension with reversed bottom wishbone, <b>top</b> <b>link</b> and dual radius arms. The front upright was specially cast {{in common with the}} F2 version of Lotus 41X to accommodate a larger Girling brake for the later 47A model (which had the Alfa Romeo tail lamp shared with the Europa S2) with reinforced front frame.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was {{a typical}} double wishbone arms with outboard coil/damper unit using the Triumph upright made by Alford & Alder, Triumph Herald rack and pinion steering, and outboard Girling non-ventilated disc brake. The rear had the <b>top</b> <b>link</b> with lower reversed wishbone, top and bottom radius arms with the top arm {{at the height of}} the halfshaft, combined with the outboard disc brakes and coil/damper unit. Unlike the arrangement for Lotus 20 suspension, the halfshafts had Metalastic rubber 'doughnuts' on the inside, carrying no cornering (side) forces. The side forces are carried by the lower wishbone, together with the top 'I' arm link, which connects the tail end of the upper side tube in the frame with the extended top end of cast alloy upright.|$|E
