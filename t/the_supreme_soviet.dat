5|$|When Belarus became {{independent}} from the Soviet Union in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> of Belarus passed the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, proclaiming Byelorussian SSR acts legal priority over USSR ones (per article 7 of the Declaration, but this provision was inserted into 1978 Constitution only in August 1991) and formally starting a constitutional process in Republic. Soon afterwards, the government established a Constitution Commission {{to facilitate the}} adoption of a post-Soviet constitution. In November 1991, the commission sent the first of three drafts to <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> Upon approval from <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> the first draft was published in December 1991 in order for the Belarusian populace to make comments and suggestions. The commission submitted the third and final draft to <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> where it was signed on March 15, 1994 by the Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> and Head of State, Myechyslaw Hryb. The gazette Zvezda officially published the Constitution fifteen days later. <b>The</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> passed a second law along with the Constitution, titled the Enactment Law, rendering the 1978 Byelorussian SSR Constitution and the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic void, with a few exceptions. The law, passed during the thirteenth session of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> also provided transitional phases for office holders and government organs to form within two years. Every year since 1994, March 15 has been commemorated in Belarus as Constitution Day, a national holiday.|$|E
5|$|During the referendum, 84% of the {{approximately}} 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results {{not directly related to}} the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to dissolve <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to dissolve <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> quashed the measure.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, after Nikita Khrushchev's ouster, a plenum of the Central Committee (CC) forbade {{any single}} {{individual}} {{to hold the}} two most powerful posts of the country (the office of the General Secretary and the premier), and Kosygin {{was in charge of}} economic administration in his role as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However Kosygin's position was weakened when he proposed an economic reform in 1965. Under the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government of the USSR. The premier was the chief of the executive branch and head of the union government as a whole, the premiership was the highest governmental office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition until the establishment of the Presidency in 1990. The premier was responsible and accountable to <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> and in the period between sessions of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> accountable to the Presidium of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> The premier was tasked with resolving all state administrative duties within the jurisdiction of the USSR to the degree that it did not come under the competence of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> or the Presidium. The premier managed the national economy, formulated the five-year plans and ensured socio-cultural development.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{of government in}} the Armenian SSR was identical {{to that of the}} other Soviet republics. The highest political body of the republic was the Armenian Supreme Soviet, which included the highest judicial branch of the republic, the supreme court. Members of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> served for a term of five years, whereas regional deputies served {{for two and a half}} years. All officials holding office were mandated to be members of the Communist Party and sessions were convened in <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> building in Yerevan.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E
50|$|The synthezoid {{originally}} {{known as}} Sputnik {{was a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviets.</b> <b>The</b> team had been sent by the Soviet government to capture the Soviet Super-Soldiers, who were attempting to defect to the United States.

5|$|The Republic of Belarus {{was formed}} in 1991 shortly after declaring itself {{independent}} of the Soviet Union. Under {{the government of the}} Byelorussian SSR, the de facto leader of the Soviet Republic was the first secretaries of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, the only legal party in Soviet Belarus. From independence until passage of the Constitution in 1994, the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> was the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government. When {{the office of the presidency}} was created, the role of the prime minister was reduced to assisting the president and resulted in the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> along with its Chairman, in 1996.|$|E

5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier.

5|$|On 3 September 1963, the Foreign Relations Committee {{approved}} the treaty by a 16â€“1 vote.

5|$|During his lifetime, Kosygin {{received}} seven Orders and two Awards {{from the}} Soviet state. He was awarded two Hero of Socialist Labour (USSR); one being on his 60th birthday by the Presidium of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> in 1964, {{on this occasion}} he was also awarded an Order of Lenin and a Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. On 20 February 1974, to commemorate his 70th birthday, the Presidium of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> awarded him another Order of Lenin and his second Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. In total, Kosygin was awarded six Orders of Lenin by the Soviet state, and one Order of the October Revolution and one Order of the Red Banner of Labour. During a state visit to Peru in the 1970s with Leonid Brezhnev and Andrei Gromyko, all three were awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun by President Francisco Morales BermÃºdez. The Moscow State Textile University was named in his honour in 1981, in 1982 a bust to honour Kosygin was placed in Leningrad, present day Saint Petersburg. In 2006 the Russian Government renamed a street after him.|$|E

5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{made several}} key trips to {{communist}} Cuba {{and to the}} United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene, especially with his skill in exercising soft power to further Soviet interests. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Brezhnev to power.

Captain America persuaded the spirits not to kill the others, and the black shape disappeared. Captain America returned home to discover the three Russian heroes making a rapid recovery.|$|R
5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet.</b> In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Soon Vladimir Bukovsky {{was again}} out of favour with the Russian authorities. He {{supported}} Yeltsin against <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in October that year but criticised the new Constitution of Russia approved two months later, as being {{designed to ensure}} a continuation of Yeltsin's power. According to Bukovsky, Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards, and a restoration of KGB rule was inevitable.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but {{must work together}} to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying to stave off the opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet</b> down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Soviet,</b> Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian Popular Front criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E
