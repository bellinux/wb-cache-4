40|$|This {{tutorial}} {{outlines the}} theory of nonlinear spectroscopy with quantum light, and in particular with entangled photons. To this end, we briefly review molecular quantum electrodynamics, and discuss the approximations involved. Then we outline the perturbation theory underlying nonlinear spectroscopy. In contrast to the conventional semiclassical theory, our derivation starts from Glauber's photon counting formalism, and naturally includes the semiclassical theory as a special case. Finally, we review previous work, which we sort into work depending on the unusual features of quantum noise, and work relying upon quantum correlations in entangled photons. This work naturally draws from both quantum optics and chemical physics. Even though {{it is impossible to}} provide a comprehensive overview of both fields in one tutorial, this text aims to be self-contained. We refer to specialised reviews, where we cannot provide details.

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} papers {{published}} {{in the field of}} nursing practice has greatly increased in recent years in Mainland China, yet the quality of these papers is highly variable. There has been no attempt to comprehensively estimate the overall quantity and quality of these papers. Objectives: To systematically retrieve nursing intervention studies published in simplified Chinese from 1979 to 2012, critically appraise their quality, and provide suggestions for future development. Methods: All of the papers were retrieved from China Biology Medicine disc database. The preliminary screening of retrieved publications was performed prior to conducting a rigorous quality evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>publications.</b> 10 characteristics would be included in consideration in quality evaluations. Results: 69, 150 papers were retrieved according to searching strategy. 7391 of them were included after preliminary screening and appraised critically. Among the 10 characteristics considered in quality evaluations, the lowest ratings were observed for the factors of “utilisation of blind method” (13 articles), “description of loss of follow-up” (499 articles), “appropriate calculation of sample size” (511 articles) and “randomised assignment of patients to treatments” (652 articles). Conclusions: Chinese papers {{published in the}} field of nursing practice have increased over time, but improvements remain needed to ensure that thorough studies with high-quality research methodologies are being performed. Future nursing researchers should not only improve the design of their intervention studies but also clearly describe the methodology they used, especially in group randomisation, blinded research designs, and estimations of required sample sizes...|$|R
40|$|Entomologically, {{metamorphosis}} {{is defined}} as the process of transformation from an immature form to an adult form. No better term exists for the coming of age of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in 2014. The pivotal trials of antifibrotic agents (1, 2) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) changed the specialty irrevocably. For the first time, the diagnostic distinction between IPF and other forms of ILD matters therapeutically. The reappraisal of risks and benefits of invasive diagnostic procedures and the emerging data on the diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in key IPF subgroups has major implications for multidisciplinary practice. The efficacy of pirfenidone and nintedanib poses new challenges in trial design. The perceived need for earlier IPF diagnosis has led to increased interest in studies of “interstitial lung abnormalities” (ILAs) in elderly patients. Acute exacerbations of IPF are under renewed scrutiny, and the surge in Internet information on IPF has created its own problems regarding misinformation. Basic science research in IPF mechanisms, already an area of rapid development, has never seemed more relevant to future clinical developments. The changes within the ILD specialty are captured by the nature of articles published in 2016 in the Journal. IPF was either the primary focus or an important component in 15 of 21 ILD perspectives and original research articles.
