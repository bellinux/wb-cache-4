5|$|In 1540 Montejo the Elder, {{who was now}} in {{his late}} 60s, turned his royal rights to {{colonise}} Yucatán over to his son, Francisco Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger.</b> In early 1541 Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> joined his cousin in Champton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger,</b> commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucatán Peninsula. Shortly afterwards, Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them {{to submit to the}} Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> sent his cousin against them (also called Francisco de Montejo); Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The best attested sibling of Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> {{was arguably}} Theodore. Maria, sister of Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Younger,</b> is {{mentioned}} by Nikephoros I and identified as mother of Martina, whom Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> {{would go on}} to marry. It should be noted, however, that both Kedrenos and Michael the Syrian consider Martina to have been a daughter of an unnamed brother of Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Younger,</b> thus casting some doubt on the precise relation. Finally, Theophanes briefly mentions another Gregoras as a brother of Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> {{on the occasion of the}} former's death at Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) circa 652/653. This is the only mention of this sibling. Theophanes, however, might have misunderstood the relation between Gregoras and the emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} attribution to Droeshout <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> {{can also}} be supported on stylistic grounds.

50|$|A game {{is usually}} {{conducted}} as follows. A young man on horseback waits at a starting line. A young woman, also mounted, starts her horse galloping from a given distance behind <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man. When <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman passes <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man, he may start his horse galloping. The two race towards a finish line some distance ahead. If <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man {{is able to}} catch up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman before they reach the finish line, he may reach out to her and steal a kiss, which constitutes victory. However, if <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man has not caught up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman by <b>the</b> time they reach the finish line, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman turns around and chases <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man back to the starting line.

5|$|At Campeche, {{a strong}} Maya force {{attacked}} the city, but was repulsed by the Spanish. Aj Canul, {{the lord of}} the attacking Maya, surrendered to the Spanish. After this battle, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo parcelled out the province amongst his soldiers as encomiendas. After six months of Spanish rule, Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger.</b> The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> abandoned Ciudad Real by night, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> was received in friendship by {{the lord of the}} Chel province. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, (near modern Mérida).|$|E
5|$|At Campeche, the Maya {{amassed a}} strong force and {{attacked}} the city; the Spanish {{were able to}} fight them off, a battle in which the elder Montejo was almost killed. Aj Canul, {{the lord of the}} attacking Maya, surrendered to the Spanish. After this battle, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers and gave each of his men two to three thousand Maya in encomienda. After six months of Spanish rule, Cupul dissatisfaction could no longer be contained and Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger.</b> The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> abandoned Ciudad Real by night after arranging a distraction for their attackers, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo <b>the</b> <b>Younger</b> was received in friendship by Namux Chel, the lord of the Chel province, at Dzilam. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, near T'ho (the modern city of Mérida).|$|E

60|$|We were {{no sooner}} fairly off, than <b>the</b> <b>young</b> ladies' young gentleman hummed a {{fragment}} of an air, which induced a young lady to inquire whether he had danced to that the night before.
