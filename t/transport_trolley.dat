50|$|Articulated {{steering}} is {{a system}} by which a four-wheel vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected {{with one or more}} hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use steering arms, king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Long road trains, articulated buses, and internal <b>transport</b> <b>trolley</b> trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles. Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.|$|E

40|$|Virtual worlds such as Second Life {{may offer}} a new {{environment}} to deliver simulation-based safety training to clinicians. The objective {{of this study was}} to design and implement a simulation of inpatient transfers in the virtual world of Second Life, and to undertake a preliminary evaluation of its usability as an educational tool. A simulation of inpatient transfer was developed using the Linden Scripting Language in Second Life. A virtual hospital was built and four scenarios of inpatient transfer varying in mode of <b>transport</b> (bed, <b>trolley</b> or wheelchair) and infection control precautions (no-infection, droplet, contact or airborne infection) were implemented. System usability was assessed using a " think aloud" protocol in combination with surveys and interviews with 15 participants who found the simulation environment easy to use, and fit for purpose. The novelty of using a virtual world was regarded as an advantage over other training methods, as was the opportunity to learn and practice inpatient transfers while receiving instant feedback during the process. Participants agreed that simulation has potential to improve awareness about hand hygiene and prevent errors. Second Life was able to support the development of a virtual environment for patient safety training. Results from preliminary usability tests indicate acceptance of the simulation environment. Further investigation is required to evaluate usability with a representative group and determine if training porters in a virtual world will reduce errors in the real world. 8 page(s...|$|R

This study investigated the frequency of parent-child interactions that occur when parents accompany young children in prams while moving between shops. Overall, minimal levels of interaction were observed between parents and children aged 0 - 3 years. Most children were transported in prams where they faced forward and could not see their parents, making interaction more difficult. Language interactions may be facilitated in prams where children face towards their parents but {{only a small number of}} prams with this design were observed. Support for the value of being able to face towards parents was seen in the higher frequency of language interactions that occurred when young children were <b>transported</b> in supermarket <b>trolleys.</b> Greater parental awareness of the importance of one-to-one language exchanges could increase the value of shopping excursions as a time for parent-child interaction...|$|R

40|$|Trolley is {{the main}} {{transport}} for human to carry load. Every trolley has different use and specific use. (It’s limited to do other job than the specification). There are some common problem can be detect at the trolleys nowadays such as don’t have stopper, load easy to fall (slips surface), heavyweight, only suitable for flat surface road, need many wheels, hard to cornering, not suitable for small area, cannot load many things, unstable for heavy duty work, high force needed to push or pull the trolley, hard to manufacturer and expensive material. To reduce this problem, one new trolley will be development that have multi function and has not limited to do another task or job. Nowadays, people use trolley to carry heavy load. There are many type of trolley in the market like industrial trolley, drum truck trolley and platform truck trolley. Many trolleys has been developed with a specific task or job like shopping trolley which can be use only for shopping, bagged trolley is only to carry bags, and <b>transporting</b> tray <b>trolley</b> only to carry trays.

40|$|Effective {{management}} of modern electrical transport systems {{is a very}} important and difficult task. Much of the transport of passengers in cities is based on electric vehicles. Tram and <b>trolley</b> <b>transport</b> in Sofia is quite largely developed. It {{is one of the largest}} consumers of electricity in the city, which makes the question of electricity prediction very important for its operation. The paper presents two models predicting electricity consumption. One model is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and the other on Time Series Analysis (TSA). The purpose of this paper is to compare the two models in certain indicators to determine and to identify their advantages and disadvantages. The main conclusion will be that the ANN model is much more precise but requires more inputs and computational efforts, while the TSA model, against some errors, shows a low demanding input entries and an easy computational approach. In addition, the ANN model has a lower range of prediction, since it needs many recent inputs in order to produce the output. On the contrary, the TSA model prediction, once the model has been calibrated on a certain time range, can be extended to any time, of course losing precision in the forecast...|$|R

Tom Banks from Design Week {{magazine}} visited the area underneath the stage which was about [...] tall only, where the dancers changed, props were handed and performers reached the stage often through numerous hydraulic lifts. Banks further described the space as a [...] "subterranean area, which is the footprint beneath the stage rather than back-stage. It's a maze of tunnels, wires and props interrupted only by platforms poised to send performers up into the light". Madonna was <b>transported</b> on a <b>trolley</b> {{from one end to the}} other end of the stage.

40|$|AbstractUrban goods {{distribution}} {{is important for}} the economy. However urban transport causes traffic, noise and pollution. The European Research project CityLog (part of Framework Programme 7) aims at increasing efficiency in urban distribution by proposing a logistics model based on two types of vehicles and containers solution in the context of parcel delivery. The urban delivery scheme currently consists of a number of vehicles that leave the hub and drive towards the city. The innovative logistics model for urban deliveries introduces a concept which make use of two types of vehicles: a Freight bus which is loaded at the depot with several load units that can carry generic parcels, and a Delivery van which is a light vehicle with high eco-compatible characteristics that make it very suitable {{to be used in the}} inner city Each load unit, when transferred from the Freight bus to the Delivery van, replaces the body of the van. These interoperable vehicles and containers form an improved logistics chain, reducing the number of vehicles entering the city, chilometers driven and pollutant emissions. Another source of unnecessary driven chilometers is unsuccessful deliveries when the receiver is not home during the delivery. The Modular BentoBox is the second concept introduced by the project. It allows to obtain a balance between optimisation of logistics and customer's interests by delivering goods to the bentobox, instead that to the customer location. There parcels are stored in the bentobox until the customer picks them up. The Modular BentoBox System introduces the concept of removable modules that is trolleys with various size drawers. These trolleys and their drawers are filled in with parcels at the depot. The carrier <b>transports</b> the <b>trolleys</b> downtown and inserts them into the bentobox. As soon as the customer is notified, the parcel is ready at the bentobox. To access the parcel, the customer enters his special code on a user interface. The Modular BentoBox System can also be provided with a weighting and payment system and used for shipping parcels. The trolleys with shipments are taken back to the depot by the carrier. These CityLog concepts will be implemented and tested in 2012 in three European cities: Berlin, Lyon and Turin...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{survey of the}} sweet potato marketing chain, from the farm to the market, indicated that substantial loses in quality can occur at all stages. Sacks, containing between 107 and 114 kg of sweet potatoes took between 16 and 23 hours to reach the market. After leaving the farm, they were <b>transported</b> by bicycle, <b>trolley,</b> canoe, ship and light commercial vehicle. Assessment of the sweet potatoes, immediately after harvesting, indicated that approximately 20 % to 35 % of the sweet potatoes had minor cuts, 14 % to 28 % had breaks, 19 % to 60 % had signs of minor skinning, 13 % to 59 % had skin weevil and 1 % to 4 % burrowing weevil damage. After transport from the farm to the market, the level of damage in freshly harvested sweet potatoes increased such that 100 % of the sweet potatoes had skinning damage, most severely, and 38 % to 56 % had breaks. Transport had little impact on the proportion of sweet potatoes with cuts or weevil damage. Shrivelled sweet potatoes were less susceptible to damage. The presence of rots, however, led to the sweet potatoes receiving a nominal market value. Handling of the sacks was monitored by visual observations and by shock, temperature and humidity measurements recorded by an 'electronic sweet potato', designed and assembled at NRI, which was inserted into {{the centre of the}} sacks. The most severe handling (shocks above 20 g) occurred during loading and unloading from the ship, at the customs station of the port and at the markets and appeared {{to be associated with the}} occurrence of major breaks. The temperature (220 C to 340 C) in the sacks was optimum for curing although the very high humidity (greater than 95 %) might lead to the occurrence of rots. Further studies will investigate seasonal variations along with other methods of transport to suggest practical and economic recommendations on improved transport and handling practices and direct future research...|$|R
