5|$|Things {{happened}} so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All {{of a sudden there}} were police <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.|$|E
25|$|Six of the escapees were <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> {{talked for}} about three hours with me trying to persuade them to come back. They {{told me that they}} had {{sent a letter to the}} Minister of Justice Bakoa Kaltongga, {{complaining}} that they had been at ‘Container City’ since June in very confined areas, not allowed visitation rights and had no chance to see their chiefs for rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of <b>there.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir! It's steep chances {{you don't}} get <b>there</b> to-night <b>and</b> <b>we</b> {{can make a}} Mappin camp in about three hours down-stream." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fellows, I {{believe there}} is a camp over <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> if <b>we</b> can manage to get across perhaps we'll learn {{something}} about our belongings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are trying}} {{to lend a hand}} to the troops over <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> are all good shots, I think we are being of some assistance." ...|$|R
25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are simply re-energizing them.|$|E
25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E
500|$|Positive Black Soul has {{promoted}} political activity and activism in other areas. The group urged Senegalese people {{to participate in}} the country's government and vote in elections. PBS also decries images of Africa in the media, which they view as one-sided. They state: [...] "We want to show the positivity in the black soul. That's our fight. Africa is not only a land of suffering, misery, war and disease. We're proud to live <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are not suffering." [...] They view their chosen medium of rap as an accessible way to talk about issues such as corruption and politics. AIDS has also been featured in their music: one song, [...] "Écoute Fils" [...] ("Listen Son"), is written about the disease and cautions listeners about its dangers.|$|E

500|$|Bill Clinton {{has given}} dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to {{corporations}} and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech. Hillary Clinton {{said that she}} and Bill {{came out of the}} White House financially [...] "broke" [...] and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. [...] "We had no money when we got <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education." [...] She added, [...] "Bill has worked really hard... we had to pay off all our debts... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a concert}} in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in April 1966, Dylan said of the song, [...] "This is, this is called Tom Thumb. This story takes place outside of Mexico City. It begins in Mexico City and it ends really in Des Moines, Iowa, but it's all about this painter, he's a quite older fellow, he comes from Juarez, Juarez is down cross of Texas border, some few feets, and he's a painter. He's very very {{well-known}} painter in the area <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all call him Tom Thumb and when Tom Thumb was going through his blue period, {{this is one of}} the most important times of his whole life and he's going to sell many many paintings now taken from his blue period and this is all about Tom Thumb and his early days and so we name this Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Medusa" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because {{of the scope of}} the episode, a [...] "huge budget" [...] was allotted for the entry. Because the episode was written to take place in a subway system, a set meeting the requirements of the script had to be created. The eventual set was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway, a system that serves more than 700,000 people a day. According to star Robert Patrick, [...] "They got us in <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> did it, and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage." [...] Patrick later described the set as [...] "the biggest damned thing I'd ever seen in my life." [...] In real life, the Boston subway system is [...] "fondly" [...] called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In [...] "Medusa", the [...] "T", was changed to an [...] "M" [...] "for fictional purposes".|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{town had}} swelled up some, but {{one or two}} of the old stores was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> walked past the windows I says: 'Remember the time <b>we</b> stood here <b>and</b> wished <b>we</b> could buy things?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good deal," [...] {{said the}} girl, in a graver tone. [...] "I can't just 'splain the diff'rence, but it's <b>there.</b> <b>And,</b> anyhow, <b>we</b> never eat such dreadful things as BUGS." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'L'hôtel Français, et Pension,' {{we used to}} call it, for you {{understand}} that we were all brave men <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>we</b> did not lose our spirits because we were in adversity.|$|R
500|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearing that {{introducing}} the character as an [...] " [...] to the boys" [...] would hinder {{their chances of}} successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be [...] "a character in [...] own right" [...] and deemed her an antagonist [...] "with [...] own interests and [...] own motives" [...] rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, [...] "If the chemistry is <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> see the sparks, and {{we want it to}} happen, and the fans want it to happen, it'll happen." [...] Due to [...] "protective and occasionally nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in [...] "small doses". Wanting fans to know the show would always be about Sam and Dean, and nothing else, he stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor is it about the four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." ...|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up {{to the point where we}} were standing erect".|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is worse}} nor the market," [...] he said. [...] "A chap {{can pick up}} a few coppers <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> here <b>we</b> have been a-tramping about all day and aint done nothing." ...|$|R

500|$|Cannon first {{played for}} the LSU varsity {{football}} team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team's primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon's college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech's focus was solely on Taylor. [...] "They were just wearing Jimmy out", he said. [...] "Of course, they weren't looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game." [...] Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:"We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were going to hit him high and low. We were going to knock {{the hell out of}} him... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don't forget that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A deputy company {{commander}} in the Golani Brigade responded by saying [...] "The claim that the IDF acted immorally is an untrue statement, and our situation in Shujaiyeh is {{the best example of}} [...] this. Hamas operatives were waiting for us <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were sent into a carefully laid trap because of our considerations in harming the Palestinian population." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{best thing}} for us was the freedom {{we had to make}} it. We had all the time we wanted on it. With Kevin being in Melbourne we’d take a week here and <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> could work and shape the songs more with that freedom and time ... there were periods where, for example, Kevin {{was the only one in}} the studio with the rest of us all working or doing whatever.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} into their rear," [...] he said. [...] "We must creep along the sand until we reach those bushes up <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> can get behind them. I'll go first, {{and you can}} follow me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Passengers," [...] {{said the}} officer, [...] "I {{am going to}} put out to sea--at any rate, till daylight. We may meet a vessel <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> if <b>we</b> try to row ashore we shall {{certainly}} be swamped in the breakers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some people {{accused me}} of being pro-Muslim in Bosnia, but I {{realised}} that {{our job is to}} give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide you can't just be neutral. You can't just say, [...] "Well, this little boy {{was shot in the head}} and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he had an argument with his wife." [...] No, there is no equality <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to tell the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Butler, Scott Ritter's boss {{under the}} United Nations in Iraq, said that Ritter [...] "wasn't prescient" [...] in his {{predictions}} about WMDs, saying, [...] "When {{he was the}} 'Alpha Dog' inspector, then by God, there were more weapons <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to go find them—a contention {{for which he had}} inadequate evidence. When he became a peacenik, then it was all complete B.S., start to finish, and there were no weapons of mass destruction. And that also was a contention for which he had inadequate evidence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Averaging {{1 million}} views per month, Blumenfeld says that If I Were Yous fanbase is {{primarily}} {{made up of}} 15 to 34 year olds. Hurwitz says that they like advising people younger than them, [...] "because we were <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> came out the other side." [...] More than that, Hurwitz says that he enjoys reaching out to [...] "nerdy" [...] younger fans because they can act as role-models to show that their best days are ahead of them: [...] "We're like a little beacon of hope for losers that are told they're gonna be cool in ten years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see I {{can engage}} a {{carriage}} {{to take us}} there myself," [...] said Rollo.
