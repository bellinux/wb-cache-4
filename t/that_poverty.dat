5|$|Though he {{was gaining}} adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim {{was not to}} enter politics, but to persuade {{existing}} parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> could exist {{in the midst of}} plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls attention to the fact <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

25|$|Harris' {{government}} reduced Ontario {{welfare rolls}} by 500,000 people; critics contend these cuts {{led to a}} rise in homelessness and poverty.

Employment rates increased significantly during the late 1990s. The government rewrote labour laws to require secret ballot votes before workplaces could unionize.

25|$|Two chance events helped spark Johnson's {{interest}} {{in politics and}} social questions, and convert him from a conventional business tycoon to a radical reformer.

25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2000 revealed <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> of Nicaraguan families heightened {{the risk of}} infant mortality. Its findings also showed that social inequity, or the contrast in wealth between a household and its surrounding neighborhood, further increased this risk. In addition to income levels, {{it has been shown}} that violence against mothers increases the risk of infant and child mortality. Intimate partner abuse also contributes to low birth weight of infants. Overall decreasing national infant mortality trends correspond with higher educational levels of mothers and lower fertility rates.|$|E

25|$|In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4–2hectares (1–5acres) in size, while 40% were of 2–6hectares (5–15acres). Holdings were {{so small}} that no crop other than {{potatoes}} would suffice to feed a family. Shortly before the famine the British government reported <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> was so widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their families after paying their rent, except by earnings of seasonal migrant labour in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented making it illegal to further divide land holdings.|$|E
25|$|One {{sad story}} redolent of its era {{is that of}} a 'professional class' couple from England, Mr. & Mrs. Barker, who {{committed}} suicide in Victorian times (1844) by tying themselves together and jumping from Laigh Milton Viaduct into the Irvine, which has a depth of only around three feet at this point. They were buried in the Kilmaurs churchyard in an unmarked grave. They are known to have spent a few weeks in lodgings and apparently enjoyed the 'sights and sounds' of Ayrshire. It transpired that they had recently become bankrupt and were fearful of the shame and disgrace <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> would inevitably bring.|$|E
25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E

The shops sold goods <b>that</b> only <b>poverty</b> could buy, and sellers and buyers were pinched and griped alike. Here were poor streets where faded gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its last feeble stand, but tax-gatherer and creditor came there as elsewhere, and the <b>poverty</b> <b>that</b> yet faintly struggled was hardly less squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given up the game.|$|R
40|$|The social {{disorganization}} and anomie perspectives generally suggest <b>that</b> <b>poverty’s</b> criminogenic {{effect is}} racially invariant. These perspectives imply that policies that alleviate economic deprivation will equally reduce rates {{of violent crime}} in neighborhoods that are predominately white and neighborhoods that are predominately black. In contrast, several social commentators have suggested <b>that</b> alleviating <b>poverty</b> will be a relatively ineffective crime reduction strategy in predominately black areas. Existing empirical research on this issue has been mostly at the city level, and almost entirely cross-sectional. The present study examines potential racial differences in the longitudinal relationship between neighborhood poverty and violent crime rates. We use iteratively reweighted least squares, a robust regression technique, to estimate race-specific effects for Cleveland census tracts, 1990 - 2000. The results are supportive of the racial invariance hypothesis. Reductions in neighborhood poverty appear to produce similar reductions in violent crime in white and black neighborhoods. ...|$|R

Three theories have been proposed: first that sati {{was believed to be}} supported by Hindu scriptures by the 19th century, second that sati was encouraged by unscrupulous neighbors because it was a means of property annexation from a widow who had the right to inherit her dead husband's property under Hindu law and sati helped eliminate the inheritor, and third theory being <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> was so extreme during the 19th century that sati was a means of escape for a woman with no means or hope of survival.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations (UN) has {{released}} guidelines on how human trafficking {{can be prevented}} on an international scale. According to the guidelines nations should identify demand as a major cause for trafficking to exist. It is also recommended <b>that</b> <b>poverty,</b> inequality and discrimination be examined as these factors, depending on prevalence, can lead to trafficking. According to a report on human trafficking prevention, {{it is recommended that}} it is the government's job to improve the options that are available to its citizens and migrants through various programs that will lead to an overall improved life.

25|$|The {{poverty line}} {{threshold}} of $1.90 per day, as {{set by the}} World Bank, is controversial.

US$ 0.55 per day)|publisher=The Government of China|year=2011|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/official/2011-11/16/content_1994729_3.htm}} These different poverty lines make data comparison between each nation's official reports qualitatively difficult. Some scholars argue that the World Bank method sets the bar too high, others argue it is low. Still others suggest <b>that</b> <b>poverty</b> line misleads as it measures everyone below the poverty line the same, when in reality someone living on $1.20 per day is in a different state of poverty than someone living on $0.20 per day. In other words, the depth and intensity of poverty varies across the world and in any regional populations, and $1.25 per day poverty line and head counts are inadequate measures.|$|E
