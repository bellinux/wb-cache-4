5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was a heretic to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he is believed by some {{to be related to the}} Assad family.|$|E
