5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to <b>the</b> <b>rotor,</b> as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{cross-country}} flight to Wright Field in Ohio from Platt-LePage's Pennsylvania plant, {{testing of the}} XR-1A continued until a mechanical failure in <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> hub led to a crash landing on 26 October 1944, the company deciding to sell the wreckage for scrap.|$|E
40|$|In wave motion, {{the water}} {{particles}} {{are known to}} follow orbital paths. This orbital motion was used to drive five-bladed Savonius rotors. Experiments were performed on an array of four rotors placed in a two-dimensional (2 -D) wave channel. The flow around <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> was documented using particle image velocimetry measurements. The submergence of <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> and <b>the</b> distance between them were varied, and the rotational speeds of <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> (Nn) were recorded at different wave frequencies. It was found that rotational speeds increased {{with an increase in}} the wave frequency, as it amplified the wave height that increased the kinetic energy of the particles in their orbital motion. The rotational speeds decreased when the distance between <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> increased. High rotational speeds are recorded when the array of <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> is placed close to the water surface at the smallest centre-to-centre distance between <b>the</b> <b>rotors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} circulation-controlled rotors are examined by comparing data from three full-scale rotors: a conventional <b>rotor,</b> <b>the</b> X-Wing <b>rotor,</b> and <b>the</b> Circulations Control <b>Rotor.</b> Both <b>the</b> X-Wing <b>rotor</b> and Circulation Control Rotor had higher sound levels than <b>the</b> conventional <b>rotor</b> at identical advancing-tip Mach numbers. There is excess noise {{due to the}} compressor on <b>the</b> X-Wing <b>rotor</b> and excess broadband noise on <b>the</b> Circulation Control <b>Rotor.</b> <b>The</b> X-Wing <b>rotor</b> had lower sound levels than <b>the</b> conventional <b>rotor</b> at identical forward speeds because of the lower tip speed feasible {{with the use of}} circulation control...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> open <b>rotor</b> {{design is}} known to have {{increased}} noise compared to normal turbofan engines, where noise is contained by the engine duct. <b>The</b> forward <b>rotor</b> is larger in diameter than <b>the</b> rear <b>rotor,</b> to avoid problems with eddies from <b>the</b> forward <b>rotor</b> tips. <b>The</b> <b>rotors</b> are powered by the engine shaft via an epicyclic gearbox. These produce a large amount of heat.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} year the first hydrogen-cooled {{turbogenerator}} went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, {{this is the most}} common type in its field today.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of <b>the</b> <b>rotor.</b> At such speeds, <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rotor</b> of the Wankel {{engine is}} shaped as a {{curvilinear}} triangle {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and so it does not have constant width.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional {{unsteady}} Euler equations are numerically solved {{to simulate}} the unsteady flows around forward flight helicopter with coaxial rotors based on unstructured dynamic overset grids. The performances of <b>the</b> two coaxial <b>rotors</b> both become worse because of the aerodynamic interaction between them, {{and the influence of}} <b>the</b> top <b>rotor</b> on <b>the</b> bottom <b>rotor</b> is greater than that of <b>the</b> bottom <b>rotor</b> on <b>the</b> top <b>rotor.</b> <b>The</b> downwash velocity at <b>the</b> bottom <b>rotor</b> plane is much larger than that at <b>the</b> top <b>rotor</b> plane, and <b>the</b> downwash velocity at <b>the</b> top <b>rotor</b> plane is a little larger than that at an individual <b>rotor</b> plane. <b>The</b> downwash velocity and thrust coefficient both become larger when the collective angle of blades is added. When the spacing between <b>the</b> two coaxial <b>rotors</b> increases, <b>the</b> thrust coefficient of <b>the</b> top <b>rotor</b> increases, but <b>the</b> total thrust coefficient reduces a little, because the decrease of <b>the</b> bottom <b>rotor</b> thrust coefficient is larger than the increase of <b>the</b> top <b>rotor</b> thrust coefficient...|$|R

For <b>the</b> first <b>rotor</b> (1), which to the operator is <b>the</b> right-hand <b>rotor,</b> <b>the</b> ratchet (red) is always engaged, and steps with each keypress. Here, <b>the</b> middle <b>rotor</b> (2) is engaged because the notch in <b>the</b> first <b>rotor</b> is aligned with the pawl; it will step (turn over) with <b>the</b> first <b>rotor.</b> <b>The</b> third <b>rotor</b> (3) is not engaged, because the notch in <b>the</b> second <b>rotor</b> is not aligned to the pawl, so it will not engage with the rachet.|$|R
5|$|The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ordered 14 {{aircraft}} in 2003 {{to use in}} both the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) and transport roles. The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH-101. Special features include the automated folding of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> and tail. For the mine-hunting role, the MCH-101 has been outfitted with Northrop Grumman's AQS-24A airborne mine-hunting system and AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for a complete surface-to-bottom mine detection capability, as well as Mk-104 acoustic mine sweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. <b>The</b> <b>rotor</b> blades {{are constructed}} from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor blades {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E
50|$|Differential {{changes to}} the {{collective}} pitch (i.e. thrust) of <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> gives powerful control forces. Propulsion and retardation are obtained from the cyclic tilt of <b>the</b> <b>rotors,</b> as for a normal helicopter. Yaw moments are produced by the differential cyclic tilting of <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> (i.e. one side forward, the other back). In forward flight, the ruddervators at {{the tail of the}} blimp also add their pitch and yaw control moments.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> tail <b>rotor</b> {{is powered}} by the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed {{proportional}} to that of <b>the</b> main <b>rotor.</b> In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, <b>the</b> main <b>rotor</b> and <b>the</b> tail <b>rotor</b> are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> to keep turning {{in the event of}} an engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and tail <b>rotors.</b> During autorotation, <b>the</b> momentum of <b>the</b> main <b>rotor</b> continues to power <b>the</b> tail <b>rotor</b> and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a tail rotor have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because <b>the</b> tail <b>rotor</b> is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R
50|$|Continuous-flow VADs {{are smaller}} and {{have proven to}} be more durable than pulsatile VADs. They {{normally}} use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> are more or less cylindrical with blades that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>rotor's</b> axis.|$|R
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, India {{signed a}} {{contract}} to purchase several Mk42B Sea Kings, an upgraded variant to perform dual-purpose: anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions, following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma. These helicopters would operate from the Godavari-class frigates as well as replace the existing Sea Kings. A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B's avionics, especially the onboard software. Changes from the older Sea Kings included a brand new avionics suite, the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> blades, {{as well as the}} integration of the Sea Eagle missile, which had been procured from Britain in 1983. Between 1988 and 1992, a total of 20 Mk42B Sea Kings were delivered to the Indian Navy.|$|E
5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
50|$|When an operator, enciphering a message, {{pressed a}} key, an {{electric}} current {{passed through the}} machine and <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> turned mechanically, but not in unison. Every time a key was pushed, <b>the</b> first <b>rotor</b> would rotate one letter. This happened 26 times until <b>the</b> first <b>rotor</b> had made a complete revolution. Then <b>the</b> second <b>rotor</b> would start to rotate. And so on.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>the</b> aft <b>rotor</b> on <b>the</b> inter-rotor flow field {{of an open}} rotor {{propulsion}} rig were examined. A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) dataset that was acquired phase locked to <b>the</b> front <b>rotor</b> position has been phase averaged based on the relative phase angle between the forward and aft <b>rotors.</b> <b>The</b> aft <b>rotor</b> phase was determined by feature tracking in raw PIV images through an image processing algorithm. The effect of <b>the</b> aft <b>rotor</b> potential field on the inter-rotor flow were analyzed and shown {{to be in good}} agreement with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. It was shown that <b>the</b> aft <b>rotor</b> had no substantial effect on the position of <b>the</b> forward <b>rotor</b> tip vortex but did have a small effect on the circulation strength of the vortex when <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> were highly loaded...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel electrical machine. The {{purpose of the}} machine is to provide torque to the driving wheels of an electric vehicle. It thus contains two rotors mounted on separate but coaxial shafts and which can rotate at different speeds. Both the stator and <b>the</b> two <b>rotors</b> are of <b>the</b> disc configuration, the stator being sandwiched between <b>the</b> two <b>rotors.</b> <b>The</b> machine is excited by a three phase stator winding and <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> are squirrel cage <b>rotors.</b> <b>The</b> cores are designed so that <b>the</b> two <b>rotors</b> do not act independantly but interact {{in such a way}} as to give optimum torque distribution between <b>the</b> two <b>rotors...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E

50|$|When {{operating}} in sandy environments, sand hitting <b>the</b> moving <b>rotor</b> blades erodes their surface. This can damage <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> and presents serious and costly maintenance problems.|$|R
50|$|The {{interactions}} between <b>the</b> quantum <b>rotors</b> {{can be described}} by another (equivalent) Hamiltonian, which treats <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> not as magnetic moments but as local electric currents.|$|R
25|$|The {{magnetic}} flux {{created by the}} field windings follows {{the path of least}} magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> and creating torque. As <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> turns, different windings will be energized, keeping <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> turning.|$|E
25|$|In {{some special}} cases, the outer gimbal (or its equivalent) {{may be omitted}} so that <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> has only two degrees of freedom. In other cases, the centre of gravity of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> may be offset from the axis of oscillation, and thus the centre of gravity of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> and the centre of {{suspension}} of <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> may not coincide.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the wheels and <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> causes <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> to rotate faster with increasing vehicle speed, thereby allowing <b>the</b> <b>rotor</b> blades to continue to obtain forward lift from the wind (as seen from the ground) or to propel the vehicle (as seen from the air stream).|$|E
5000|$|... unitary rotors, {{used with}} M-125-MN. These had both {{electrical}} contacts and mechanical pins. The only key adjustment was {{the order of}} <b>the</b> <b>rotors</b> on <b>the</b> axle and <b>the</b> initial <b>rotor</b> settings. There was one combination for <b>the</b> disassemblable <b>rotors</b> that was compatible with <b>the</b> unitary <b>rotor.</b> One East German manual that has become public contains typed-in and hand written addenda that suggest the East Germans, at least, later stopped using the added features of <b>the</b> disassemblable <b>rotors</b> and only used them in unitary compatibility mode.|$|R
