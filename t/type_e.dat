Moreover, the real-time programming language Giotto can be compiled into <b>typed</b> <b>E</b> code. This shows that <b>typed</b> <b>E</b> code identifies an easily schedulable yet expressive class of real-time programs.

There were two spars, one at the leading edge and one at about one third chord, with interplane struts in parallel pairs connecting forward and aft spars. Those defining the bays and the centre section were vertical but the outer pairs leaned strongly outwards to support the longer upper wings. Lateral control was achieved by wing warping.|$|E

25|$|Internally {{eliminated}} sequences (IES) are noncoding {{regions of}} the germ-line genome found in Ciliates. They are defined as sections of DNA removed from the diploid micronuclear genome during which {{a copy of the}} micronuclear genome is converted to the macronuclear genome even though errors occur in which an IES sequence may not be deleted. There is little conservation of motifs between Ciliate species; however, C. uncinata, like other ciliate species, show a conserved IES sequence motif within a species. It is unknown if IES sequences have a function in the genome, but in the ciliate Paramecium, an IES sequence is used to determine the mating type of an individual. When a specific IES sequence is not deleted from the developing somatic nucleus, then it is type O mating type. However, if that IES is deleted from the developing macronucleus, it is <b>type</b> <b>E</b> mating type. Paramecium can only mate with individual of opposite mating type.|$|E
25|$|An {{experiment}} of 1932 was {{the addition}} of a stamp vending machine {{to the end of the}} post box. This necessitated an oval planform for the box even though it was only provided with a single posting aperture. At one end of the oval is the stamp machine and at the other is the posting aperture. The boxes have two doors; one for clearance of mail and one for emptying the cash and reloading the stamp machines. The machines were set to vend two halfpenny stamps in exchange for one old penny, the stamps being supplied in a long continuously wound roll known as a coil. Boxes were again made in two sizes, designated Type D and <b>Type</b> <b>E,</b> and carried raised lettering on the castings indicating the position of the stamp vending machine, as well as an array of small enamel plates warning users of the danger of bent coins and the need to wait for stamps to be issued before inserting more money.

40|$|Many reviewers of the {{literature}} on children’s sex typing have remarked on the failure of researchers to attend carefully to methodological issues when designing measures of sex typing. In the present article, the impor-tance of conceptually and operationally distinguishing among (a) the target of sex <b>typing</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> self vs. others), (b) the form of sex <b>typing</b> (<b>e.</b> g., knowledge vs. attitudes), and (c) the domain of sex <b>typing</b> (<b>e.</b> g., occupations, activities, etc.) i s emphasized. Several other methodologi-cal issues in measurement design, including the independence and com-parability of masculine and feminine items, are also discussed. Finally, newly developed measures of sex typing designed to address these con-ceptual and methodological issues are described. Gender is one of the fundamental dimensions along which children and adults organize the world (Bem, 1993; Martin & Halverson, 1981). Sex typing begins very early in childhood, perhaps even before the age of 2 (e. g., Bauer, 1993), and stereotypic attitudes about gender are endorse...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} Revision 3 of n 1892 [n 1892], n 2282 [n 2282] and proposes {{additional}} forms of literals using modified syntax and semantics to provide user-defined literals. User-defined literals allow user-defined classes to provide new literal syntax, a feature previously available only for built-in types. It increases compatibility with C 99 and future C enhancements, {{as well as}} more flexible C++ literals. The existing set of (C++ 03) literals is extended: Any literals may contain a userdefined suffix. Examples include &quot;Hi&quot;s, 1. 2 i, and 23 _units. A user-defined “literal operator ” function defines the mapping of such user-defined literals to actual values. User-defined literals can produce values of both built-in <b>types</b> (<b>e.</b> g., double) and userdefined <b>types</b> (<b>e.</b> g., class <b>types).</b> The proposal requires fairly localized changes to the core language. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: analisar comparativamente a mudança em <b>types</b> <b>e</b> tokens e na taxa de type/token em crianças, de ambos os sexos, entre 18 e 36 meses, falantes nativos do português brasileiro, quanto à classe gramatical e à medida total e segmentar. MÉTODO: foram gravadas e transcritas as falas de 60 crianças com desenvolvimento típico de linguagem em atividades lúdicas com as mães ou professora. A seguir, efetuaram-se os cálculos da taxa de type/token (TTR) <b>e</b> de <b>types</b> <b>e</b> tokens (ty/to), na forma total e segmentar, com sua distribuição em classes gramaticais. Os resultados foram analisados estatisticamente, por meio dos testes t-student e análise de variância (ANOVA). RESULTADOS: o número de <b>types</b> <b>e</b> tokens totais apresentou vantagens sobre o segmentar em termos de descrição de classes gramaticais e na diferenciação estatística das faixas etárias de 18, 24 e 32 meses. Evolutivamente substantivos surgem primeiro do que verbos, advérbios e adjetivos e demais classes gramaticais que se completam até 32 meses. CONCLUSÃO: não houve diferença estatística quanto ao gênero. A análise isolada dos <b>types</b> <b>e</b> tokens é mais efetiva do que a divisão dos mesmos (TTR), tendo validade estatística na diferenciação das faixas etárias de 18, 24 e 32 meses. O número de <b>types</b> <b>e</b> tokens segmentar é menos efetivo na descrição gramatical considerando faixa etária e gênero. PURPOSE: to {{comparatively}} {{analyze the}} change in types and tokens {{and the rate of}} type / token in children of both genders, aged between 18 and 36 months, native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, as for grammatical category and total measure and segmental aspect. METHOD: the speech of sixty children with typical language acquisition was recorded while playing with their mothers or teachers. The type/token ratio (TTR) and the total and segmental types and tokens were calculated, as for their grammatical distribution. The results were submitted to statistical analyses by Student Test and Variance Analysis (ANOVA). RESULTS: the total number of types and the tokens is more effective to describe children grammatical evolution, among 18 and 32 months age, than the segmental one. Substantives emerge first than verbs, adverbs, adjectives and others grammatical categories. All of the grammatical categories are in production at the 32 months of age. CONCLUSION: no statistical differences were found among genders. The analysis of types and tokens is more effective than TTR and differentiated statically the ages: 18, 24 and 32 months. The segmental numbers of types and tokens is a less effective measure for the grammatical description in ages and genders...|$|R
