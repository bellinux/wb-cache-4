40|$|The Wilmington {{oil field}} in Long Beach California {{has been a}} site of large ground {{subsidence}} since <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> production. <b>The</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsidence {{has been attributed to}} <b>the</b> lowering <b>of</b> pore fluid pressures in <b>the</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. In this study the subsidence in the Wilmington field is simulated numerically by solving the equilibrium equations for a region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth's crust containing the oil field. The input parameters for the calculation include a linearly elastic rheological mode for <b>the</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field and pore pressure values at the producing zones at specified times. It is found that the numerical simulations can reproduce reasonably well most field observations. There remain however a few observations which the present model cannot explain, a fact which suggests that <b>the</b> material response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field is more complicated than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linearly elastic model adopted in the present study...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>formation</b> {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eu-doped TiO 2 nanodots by the phase-separation-induced self-assembly {{is based}} on Marangoni effect [18 – 20]. After the precursor sol is spin-coated on the substrate, the ethanol in the liquid film is evaporated but the evaporation rate is gradient in thickness direction. The Marangoni effect can lead to convective flows in the liquid film with a large temperature gradient during the spin-coating process. <b>The</b> requirement <b>of</b> minimizing <b>the</b> extra surface free energy induces <b>the</b> <b>formations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TBOT/Eu(TMHD) 3 droplets and the PVP phase. After hydrolysis, the TBOT/Eu(TMHD) 3 droplets become gel nanodots, which form Eu-doped TiO 2 nanodots after calcination.|$|R
