5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is {{reassigned to}} teach at the FBI Academy while Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is given lowly {{surveillance}} assignments. After he investigates extraterrestrial cases at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), and meets a secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be a mole working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek. When Krycek vanishes, Skinner re-opens the X-Files, claiming <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> conspirators will fear most.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to change the name of its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E

25|$|Children come {{equipped}} with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All {{that is needed}} is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG {{does not have the}} necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> child will acquire.

25|$|Three of Mayflowers owners {{applied to}} the Admiralty court for an {{appraisal}} of the ship on May 4, 1624, two years after Captain Jones' death in 1622; one of these applicants was Jones' widow Mrs. Josian (Joan) Jones. This appraisal probably was made to determine the valuation of the ship {{for the purpose of}} settling the estate of its late master. The appraisal was made by four mariners and shipwrights of Rotherhithe, home and burial place of Captain Jones, where the Mayflower was apparently then lying in the Thames at London. The appraisement is extant and provides information on ship's gear on board at that time, as well as equipment such as muskets and other arms.

Reviewers viewed a twenty-minute excerpt of footage from the game in 3D and with surround sound. The game was scheduled for release three weeks before Into Darkness premiered in theaters on May 17, 2013. Brian Miller was heavily involved in promoting the game, and regularly featured in interviews with websites and magazines.

500|$|Although the C5 reached {{retail stores}} {{at the start}} of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of {{teenagers}} to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that [...] "we haven't done... tests on inner city roads. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off." [...] Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for [...] "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting". Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.|$|E

40|$|The Darwinian {{revolution}} is generally {{taken to be}} one of the key events in the history of Western science. In recent years, however, the very notion of a scientific revolution has come under attack, and in the specific case of Charles Darwin and his Origin of Species there are serious questions about the nature of the change (if there was such) and the specifically Darwinian input. This article considers these issues by addressing these questions: Was there a Darwinian revolution? <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> was there a revolution at all? Was there a Darwinian revolution? <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> specific contribution of Charles Darwin? Was there a Darwinian revolution? <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> conceptual nature of what occurred on and around the publication of the Origin? I argue <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> a major change, both scientifically and in a broader metaphysical sense; <b>that</b> Charles Darwin <b>was</b> the major player in the change, although one must qualify the nature and the extent of the change, looking particularly at things in a broader historical context than just as an immediate event; and <b>that</b> the revolution <b>was</b> complex and we need the insights of rather different philosophies of scientific change to capture the whole phenomenon. In some respects, indeed, the process of analysis is still ongoing and unresolved...|$|R

500|$|As a subplot, Stan {{spends most}} of the episode trying to return the {{aforementioned}} Margaritaville mixer; the trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan. He tries to find out to whom he can return it, each person saying the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he {{goes all the way}} to the United States Treasury, where a group of associates [...] "consult the charts" [...] and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion. One of the three treasury workers then says that another insurance company is failing and asks what they should do. They say they have to [...] "consult the charts" [...] again. Stan follows the men inside, and he sees a round lit-up game show style board, where the men cut off a chicken's head and let the decapitated chicken run on the board while one of them plays a tune similar to Yakety Sax on a kazoo. The chicken falls on the [...] "bailout!" [...] spot, so <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> men do.

Richard Goldstein of The New York Times considered the double album to be [...] "a major success" [...] and [...] "far more imaginative" [...] than Sgt.

The agent of Michelle Rodriguez (who was 26 at the time) called the producers, informing them Rodriguez was interested in the role, but only for a year. Rodriguez, producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, and Lost creator J. J. Abrams met, and Rodriguez explained she would only be interested in one season because she was a [...] "nomadic spirit", but would like to do one [...] "kickass arc" [...] as she called it. The producers liked her energy, so agreed, with the plan to kill Ana Lucia {{at the end of the}} season. Rodriguez felt she had been typecast in tough female roles, so wanted this role to be different. Ana Lucia was planned to start as a tough character, because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> audience would expect, then the layers of the character would be gradually peeled back. Rodriguez described Ana Lucia as an [...] "animalistic type creature... tamed by the Island." [...] They reconstructed the character slightly to fit what they liked about Rodriguez, such as making her more [...] "street smart" [...] with a [...] "speak-her-mind quality." [...] Ana Lucia made her first appearance in the penultimate episode of season one, in order to set up her character becoming part of the cast in the next season. All Rodriguez was told about her character was both she and her mother were in the police force. Ana Lucia's style of leadership deliberately contrasts Jack's; Jack is a reluctant leader, whereas Ana Lucia quickly takes charge on her own. In her early appearances, Ana Lucia is shown to be very tough, so the flashbacks in [...] "Collision", where it is revealed [...] she lost her baby, were used to show a softer side to her.|$|E
