Unfortunately for Nebraska, <b>the</b> <b>underdog</b> Longhorns upset heavily favored Nebraska, 3727. Eight days after losing to Texas, Nebraska was awarded a bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E

The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points. Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were defeated by the Texas A Aggies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} {{prior to the}} Sugar Bowl, media {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's sudden rise to national prominence and Florida State's perennial appearance in the national championship game. The Seminoles had the most top-5 finishes and the most national championship game appearances of any team in the 1990s, including a national championship victory in 1993. Many media stories focused on the apparent David and Goliath showdown between the two teams, with the Seminoles {{in the role of}} the overdog and the Hokies in the role of <b>the</b> <b>underdog.</b> Because of this fact, spread bettors favored Florida State to win the game by 5.5points.|$|E
5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed <b>the</b> <b>underdog</b> in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E

Maryland, however, lost its final four {{games of the season}} to finish 46 and 33 in the ACC. In the penultimate game against , Pastrana broke the ACC record with his 13th and 14th touchdown passes of the season.

After the season, Saban left to become head coach for the Denver Broncos and he was replaced by former Maryland All-American guard Bob Ward.|$|E

Titled The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion.

5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce <b>the</b> <b>underdog.</b> Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E
