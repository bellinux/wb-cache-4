All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. <b>The</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{ends with}} the narrator turning towards his own fate, {{accepting}} his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is mysterious and tragic. Although <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} review, Famitsu gave Dream Drop Distance {{a rating of}} 10/9/10/9, or a total of 38/40, in their March 22, 2012 issue, which made Dream Drop Distance the second highest rated game in the series for them, after Kingdom Hearts II. The game debuted {{at the top of}} Media Create's sales charts, selling 213,579 copies during its first week. The release was also noted to have helped boost the sales of the Nintendo 3DS console. Although the amount of pre-orders surpassed that of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days for the Nintendo DS, the first week's sales were lower. Nevertheless, Media Create noted that this was due to <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> the amount of units sold between the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo 3DS during the time the games were released, with the former having sold more copies than the latter. The game {{continued}} to appear in Media Create's polls for the next several weeks, selling a total of 311,688 units as of May 2012. In North America, the game sold 200,000 units during August 2012, with 180,000 regular editions and 20,000 Mark of Mastery editions.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the lead}} of Frances Power Cobbe, Lind af Hageby {{regarded}} feminism and animal rights (and, in particular, vegetarianism), as strongly linked, seeing the advance of women as essential to civilization, and the tension between women and male scientists as a battle between feminism and machismo. Craig Buettinger writes that feminism and anti-vivisection were strongly linked in the UK, where <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> the treatment of woman and animals {{at the hands of}} male scientists (and, indeed, their husbands) dominated the discourse. But in the United States, the antivisectionists based their need to protect animals on their duties as mothers and Christians, and did not see advancing women's rights as part of that.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> the two groups {{has made it possible}} to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E

There is, however, an inversion in <b>the</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> these two pairs. In the former pair, the first stems from the mythical dragon, and the second from the dragon fighter, while in the latter pair it is vice versa.

40|$|Abstract: The {{representation}} {{and application of}} fuzzy knowledge on the semantic Web often relate to <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>between</b> fuzzy membership degrees. However, the current fuzzy extensions of description logics {{do not support the}} expression of such comparisons. This paper proposes an extended fuzzy description logic that supports <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> of fuzzy membership degrees and the concept constructors from description logic ALCN (attributive concept description language with complements and number restriction), written FCALCN (fuzzy comparable ALCN). FCALCN introduces new forms of atom concepts in order to support <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>between</b> fuzzy membership degrees. A reasoning algorithm for FCALCN is proposed, and the complexity of the reasoning problems of FCALCN with empty TBox is proved to be PSpace-complete. FCALCN can represent expressive fuzzy knowledge involving <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> of fuzzy membership degrees on the semantic Web and enable reasoning of them.
