5|$|This episode has {{the final}} {{speaking}} appearance of Lionel Hutz, {{five months before}} the death of Phil Hartman. The episode's development {{grew out of a}} desire by the writers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> focused on Marge, where her job did not work out. The episode received positive mention in the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, and is featured in the special 2003 DVD release The Simpsons: Risky Business.|$|E
25|$|Francesa and Russo {{mentioned}} that the two went six months on-air together without ever otherwise {{talking to each other}} due to when Russo wanted to go to Indiana <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> onsite for a Knicks-Pacers series during the 1999 NBA Playoffs, but Francesa did not. Their first flight got canceled, and instead of waiting for another one that would have had a layover in DC, Francesa declined to go. The standoff ended when Francesa's wife Roe invited Russo to Francesa's wedding.|$|E
500|$|Executive story editor Melinda Snodgrass read Ganino's {{speculative}} {{script for}} [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] in June and attached a post-it note declaring the story an [...] "interesting idea". A [...] "coverage" [...] of the script, which outlined the plot and provided creative feedback, {{was written in}} August. This analysis called the script a [...] "good effort by an unrepresented writer", and considered the script's weak characterization and plot issues correctable. The main issue was whether the producers wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with time travel.|$|E

500|$|... "There's a {{delay in}} the screen above me, so {{if you listen to}} the music and watch the screen, they don't sync up. I think that confuses people. But I'm singing every song. I'm singing my ass off. [...] There are times during the show, when I'm dancing so much, where I get out of breath, and we have a signal where I'm dying and they'll help me out. Believe me, I'd give {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> where I just sit there and sing".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Davies' pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee called [...] "Return of the Daleks". The production team had always intended for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role, Bruno Langley was chosen, previously known for his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. It was never intended for Adam to be a long-term companion, Davies wanted to show that not everyone is suitable to join the TARDIS crew and dubbed him [...] "The Companion That Couldn't", he [...] "always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with someone who was a rubbish companion".|$|E
500|$|The concert audio {{was mixed}} by Rick Camp, the same {{engineer}} who mixed at the concert venues. It is uncommon for mix engineers {{to specialize in}} both live and recorded mixing. For Camp, [...] "Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she's a real singer and makes it easy. There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." [...] He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: [...] "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show.</b> I've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and never miss a thing. And that makes my job so much easier." ...|$|E

50|$|After Willem Nijholt, Willem Ruis, Paul de Leeuw, Klaas van der Eerden {{became the}} fourth host <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> second <b>show.</b> Unlike its predecessor, album 24 {{made it to}} the charts {{reaching}} number 21.|$|R
500|$|The writers {{started to}} work for [...] "Band Geeks" [...] {{with the idea of}} a rival. Williams said, [...] "We always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> rival <b>show,</b> and I think we tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> rival <b>show</b> for SpongeBob, and it wasn't working. So we came up {{with the idea of a}} rival for Squidward and, in some ways it's Squidward's story, and SpongeBob and Patrick are just kind of around." [...] The idea of having a band was unspecified. Williams remarked, [...] "I forget who was in band. I was not in a band, but I think maybe Doug [...] was in a band. I think Steve [...] was in a band, too." ...|$|R
500|$|The ensuing feud between Conrad and Montag {{received}} extensive {{media attention}} since its beginning; Conrad was doubtful {{of the possibility}} of a reconciliation, noting that [...] "I can see us getting to not hating each other but I don't think we would ever go back to being best friends." [...] When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television, Conrad stated that [...] "I wouldn't fight for the camera. If anything I would try not to." [...] In a separate interview, she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began, stating [...] "it wasn't so much about the filming, but I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with the other people on it", which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt.|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Ray Patterson is {{reinstated}} (to which he enters and exits to the Sanford and Son theme song) was {{a reference to}} a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx (who starred on Sanford and Son). During a show in Vegas, Redd Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very few people in the audience. Foxx angrily stated that he refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with such a small audience and walked off the stage. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leaving, simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. The same incident was the basis for the joke in [...] "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] where Moe Szyslak walks onto the stage and, without breaking his stride, walks off.|$|E

25|$|Judy Garland {{performed}} {{this song}} on her weekly television show in December 1963. She originally wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> dedication <b>show</b> for President John F.

500|$|McCaw {{was taught}} to fly gliders by his {{grandfather}} J H 'Jim' McCaw who flew more than 300 missions in the Second World War. In 2009 he convinced {{the head of the}} Discovery network in Australia and New Zealand <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> about gliding. They filmed McCaw gliding at Omarama on the extreme sports series Sportstar Insider, which was hosted by former Australian rugby league player Andrew Ettingshausen. After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake he auctioned a personal flying lesson through Trade Me {{to raise money for the}} badly damaged Hororata St Johns Church. He is also raising money for a young Samoan who broke his neck playing rugby and whose village was destroyed in the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami. [...] It was revealed at his retirement announcement in 2015 that McCaw would work at Christchurch Helicopters, where he is a Director and Shareholder, and was obtaining a commercial helicopter licence. McCaw has since obtained said licence and has continued working as a helicopter pilot. He flew several rescue and reconnaissance missions following the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake that struck the South Island.|$|E
500|$|The Foreigner song [...] "Hot Blooded" [...] plays over Apu's {{bachelor}} binge, and he dances in {{a manner}} similar to Riverdance. Additionally, an Indian version of The Carpenters' song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] is sung at the wedding; an Indian vocal group was hired to sing, while Alf Clausen wrote the instrumental part. The scene where Moe walks on and off the stage without breaking his stride was loosely based on a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx. During a show in Las Vegas, Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very few people in the audience. Foxx reacted angrily refusing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with such a small audience and walked off. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leave simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. This incident was also referenced in the later episode [...] "Trash of the Titans", when Ray Patterson is reinstated, although the reference is more similar to the real event then.|$|E
500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came {{to him that the}} series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E
50|$|By 1971, the show's ratings had plummeted. In {{an effort}} to refresh its lineup, CBS {{canceled}} the program {{along with some of}} its other longtime shows. Sullivan was angered, and refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> final <b>show,</b> although he remained with the network in various other capacities and hosted a 25th anniversary special in June 1973.|$|R
25|$|According to Maxine Sanders, Sanders {{also worked}} for a while as a healer in Spiritualist Churches under the {{pseudonym}} Paul Dallas; a famous medium called Edwards discovered him and his brothers and wanted them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> stage <b>show,</b> however they refused, believing their clairvoyance, healing and mediumship to be divine gifts not to be misused.|$|R
50|$|After four seasons, Cris {{decided to}} move on to other {{projects}} and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> weekly variety <b>show</b> Jugate con Todo, which lasted four months and was not as successful.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast, American stunt performer and Jackass actor Johnny Knoxville guest starred in the episode {{as the voice of}} Johnny Krill, the leader of an extreme sports team called the Drasticals and a champion of undersea extreme sports. The writing staff wrote the episode specifically for Knoxville. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] " [...] wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> about extreme sports and the first thing that came to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans living that are as extreme as him." [...] Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said [...] "I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob. Everyone is psyched As soon as I was done recording this episode, I started begging them to let me come back and record another one." [...] Knoxville asked if he needed {{to come up with a}} funny voice for his character. However, the producers said [...] "No, we want [...]" [...] Knoxville claimed that [...] "it's not easy" [...] providing a vocal cameo. He added [...] "It's a different kind of work." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 1963, the {{perennial}} companion figure in Doctor Who generally serves {{to remind the}} Doctor of his [...] "moral duty". However, Adam {{was never meant to}} be a long-term companion. In the behind-the-scenes book Doctor Who: The Inside Story Davies explains that he [...] "always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubs Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he characterised Adam as [...] "a little bit ambitious and [...] "a little bit too clever for his own good." [...] Langley added that the character ends up [...] "on {{the wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] because he likes [...] "meddling with things" [...] and that [...] "him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he [...] "doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where knowledge, information and power are put in front of him." [...] Davies felt that Adam's story provided [...] "a chance to see someone starting on that path" [...] before the Doctor cuts his ambitions short.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E
50|$|In October 2006, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that the band had reunited. This was later dismissed by guitarist Joey D'Amico who stated that the band was just going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> few <b>shows</b> <b>to</b> promote the release of The Last Dance. However, D'Amico also stated {{that there was a}} possibility that 40 Below Summer would record a new album in the future.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 (by {{which time}} the show had spent more than one full year on NBC), both the master copy and the backup of an episode of Search for Tomorrow were lost, and on August 4, the cast was forced <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> live <b>show</b> {{for the first time}} since the {{transition}} sixteen years before (as well as the first live daytime drama since 1975).|$|R

500|$|Adam Mitchell {{joins the}} Doctor and Rose in the episode [...] "Dalek". The {{character}} was first conceived during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC: {{it was always}} the intention for Adam to join the TARDIS team after Rose developed a liking for him. Contrasting against Rose, Adam was created to show that not everybody is suited to be a companion. Davies stated that he [...] "always wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubbed Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". Upon returning Adam home, the Doctor informs him that [...] "I only take the best. I've got Rose". Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog, described Adam as fulfilling a role as [...] "the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions". From episodes nine through thirteen, Rose and the Doctor are joined by the con man Jack Harkness. Jack's appearances were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero. John Barrowman, reflecting on the interrelationships between The Doctor, Jack and Rose, felt that [...] "the subtle sexual chemistry between all three characters... was always in play" [...] with the caveat that [...] "the relationships were by no means driven by desire". SFX magazine also commented on the [...] "intoxicatingly flirtatious dynamic" [...] and compared the trio to [...] "a Buffy-style Scooby gang who can quip in the face of danger". Jack parts from the Ninth Doctor with a kiss which Barrowman felt to be [...] "full of fondess and respect" [...] and both [...] "a significant moment in the annals of the series" [...] and [...] "a moment full of melancholy and loss for the characters".|$|E
2500|$|Fassbinder {{considered}} this project [...] "an attempt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> about the Adenauer era. For us it certainly wasn't entirely successful. But the film does reveal the utter repulsiveness and sentimentality of the time" [...] he explained.|$|E
2500|$|... "Yeah. What I {{love about}} SpongeBob SquarePants is that it's very watchable for an adult. But kids {{like it because}} they don't feel like they're being pandered to. That was what we were looking to do with The Mighty B [...] We wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> that had a strong female {{character}} who didn't have too many rainbows and unicorns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gilley's and Lynn's {{appearances}} {{were not}} {{solely for the}} celebrity speed trap. After performing a concert in Hazzard, Gilley was nabbed while leaving and forced <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> second <b>show</b> <b>to</b> nullify his citation. Lynn was kidnapped by criminals wanting {{to break into the}} music business. Loretta Lynn was the very first country music guest star on the show in 1979 and had <b>an</b> entire <b>show</b> titled [...] "Find Loretta Lynn." ...|$|R
