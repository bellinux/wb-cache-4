As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships ran aground on shoals in the harbour, and a new plan of attack had to be improvised.

WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC found that this was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System.
