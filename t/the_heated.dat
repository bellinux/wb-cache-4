5|$|In {{order for}} <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> water {{to form a}} geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required.

25|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that concerns}} the thermal conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy {{is transferred from}} a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink base. <b>The</b> spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> travels from <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source location and causes a large temperature gradient between <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source and <b>the</b> edges of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source were uniform across the base of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink. This nonuniformity increases <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink's effective thermal resistance.|$|R

5|$|Disraeli's first premiership was {{dominated}} by <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> debate over the Church of Ireland. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority.

5|$|Given <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a method and a device for recovering heat from an internal combustion engine, in particular of a motor vehicle, and for converting <b>the</b> recovered <b>heat</b> into mechanical energy {{by means of}} a rankine cycle-type expansion machine.

5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. <b>The</b> <b>heated</b> tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool <b>the</b> <b>heated</b> water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. <b>The</b> <b>heated</b> product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsionâ€”a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85Â°C. <b>The</b> <b>heated</b> emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80Â°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50Â°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E

30|$|As {{industrial}} and technological products demand higher standards of function and capacity, <b>the</b> problem of <b>heat</b> dissipation from electrical appliances becomes a significant issue.
