25|$|TWA began flying nonstop to Europe with Lockheed Constellation propliners (L-1649 models) in 1957. In 1959, Qantas {{had taken}} over the ANA/BCPA route from SFO to Sydney and was {{operating}} Boeing 707 service to Australia via intermediate stops in Honolulu and Nadi, Fiji. Pan Am attempted to operate Boeing 707-320 jetliners from Tokyo nonstop to SFO in 1960–61 (the westbound nonstops had to await the longer range Boeing 707-320B due to the prevailing winds on the route). Also in 1960, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, the predecessor of British Airways) was serving the airport with Bristol Britannia turboprops that were flying a westbound routing of London – New York City – San Francisco – Honolulu – Wake Island – Tokyo – Hong Kong as part of the airline's around-the-world service. By the next year, BOAC had replaced the large, British-manufactured Britannia propjets with Boeing 707s now being flown on this intercontinental route, which enabled the airline to eliminate the <b>technical</b> <b>stop</b> at the Wake Island Airfield. Japan Airlines (JAL) was flying Douglas DC-8 jetliners by 1961 on a routing of San Francisco – Honolulu – Tokyo. Also in 1961, Lufthansa had begun serving SFO with Boeing 707s operating a routing of San Francisco – Montreal Dorval Airport – Paris Orly Airport – Frankfurt three days a week. Lufthansa then operated Boeing 720B jets on this same routing in 1963 and was also flying Boeing 707 service to Frankfurt via stops in Montreal and London Heathrow Airport the same year. By 1965, Pan American-Grace Airways, known as Panagra, was operating Douglas DC-8 jets on an international routing of San Francisco – Los Angeles – Panama City, Panama – Lima, Peru – Santiago, Chile – Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Panagra service to Latin America was taken over in the late 1960s by Braniff International, which operated Douglas DC-8-62 long range jetliners into SFO following Braniff's acquisition of Panagra. By 1970, CP Air (formerly Canadian Pacific Air Lines) was flying nonstop to Vancouver, BC with continuing, no change of plane Boeing 737-200 jet service to Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.|$|E

EAL was allowed to fly to Aden using Sheik 'Othman Airport, located [...] away from the city, whereas BOAC used the Khormaksar Airport facilities, just [...] away from the city. Aden was under British rule at the time as was Sudan, and the British Empire denied EAL landing rights at Khartoum, forcing the airline to move the refuelling stop on the Aden route to Port Sudan. The carrier recorded a £40,000 profit for 1949.|$|E
