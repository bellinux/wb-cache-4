40|$|Supporters of {{university}} <b>honors</b> programs argue <b>that</b> these programs benefit {{the university and}} entire student body while critics argue <b>that</b> <b>honors</b> programs reproduce socioeconomic and racial privileges. In an attempt to address these issues, we have used quantitative survey data to compare the background characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes of honors and non-honors students at a medium-sized public university in the Southeast. Our findings indicate racial and gender {{differences between the two}} groups but similarities in economic backgrounds. We have also found <b>that</b> <b>honors</b> students differ significantly from their non-honors peers in academic and behavioral measures. We believe that our findings support the argument <b>that</b> <b>honors</b> programs bring benefits to the entire educational system rather than simply creating a privileged class of students and <b>that</b> <b>honors</b> programs are thus worthy of the financial resources that institutions commit to them...|$|R

He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the regular season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. <b>That</b> <b>honor</b> went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the regular season.|$|E

He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (<b>that</b> <b>honor</b> ultimately went to Barack Obama).

5|$|In 1923, end Bill Supplee was {{selected}} to the Associated Press second team, which made him the first Maryland player to be named an All-American. Guard Bob Ward became the first Terrapin named to a first team when he received <b>that</b> <b>honor</b> from AP and the Football Writers Association of America in 1950. The following year, Ward became Maryland's first consensus All-American when he was unanimously chosen by every NCAA-recognized selector. Five other Terrapins have earned consensus All-America honors: Jack Scarbath in 1952, Stan Jones in 1953, Bob Pellegrini in 1955, Randy White in 1974, and linebacker E. J. Henderson in 2001. Henderson was also named a consensus All-American in 2002, which made him the first, and thus far only, Maryland player to receive the honor twice.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up {{to shake his hand}} were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded <b>that</b> <b>honor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over the years, many Maryland {{players have}} {{received}} All-American honors. Eleven Terps {{have been named}} consensus (received a majority of votes) first-team All-Americans and one, E.J. Henderson, has received <b>that</b> <b>honor</b> twice. Additionally, some have been awarded prestigious awards, including the Bednarik Award, Butkus Award, Lou Groza Award, Outland Trophy, and Lombardi Award. While no Terrapin has ever received the Heisman Trophy, which is bestowed upon college football's most outstanding player, several have received votes by the award's selection committee. Quarterbacks Jack Scarbath and Bernie Faloney finished second and fourth in the voting in 1952 and 1953, respectively. Additionally, Bob Pellegrini, Gary Collins, Randy White, and Boomer Esiason all finished in the top-ten of the voting for a Heisman.

However the tournament was dominated by an excellent Canadian team, which went undefeated and beat Russia 6-1 in the gold medal match. Its captain, Sidney Crosby joined the Triple Gold Club, becoming the first player to achieve <b>that</b> <b>honor</b> as captain of each winning team.

5|$|The Huskies {{were unable}} to match their early success {{in the second half}} of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, {{including}} one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up <b>that</b> <b>honor,</b> losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No.23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.|$|E
