When pro-active agents handle the context-aware discovery, acquisition, composition, management of applications services and data, ensuring the security if customers data become a principle task. In this paper we propose neoteric way web services and security. A methodology based on type-based information flow to control the security of dynamically computed data and their proliferation to other web services. The approach is based on the following trine guidelines: (1) The business and security concern of integrated web services are separated and building them independently. (2) Runtime modification of integrated web services. (3) Providing compartmentalization so <b>that</b> <b>one</b> service <b>can</b> <b>not</b> affect another.

2500|$|In his {{coins and}} {{inscription}} in Naqsh-e Rustam, Ardashir has called himself the worshiper of Ahura Mazda {{and from the}} line of gods. In Ardashir's subsequent coins, the dentate crown has replaced the traditional hat on his head; that change along {{with the addition of}} the phrase [...] "...looks similar to the gods" [...] (he is from the line of gods) claim Ardashir's divine place. That dentate crown looks like the same crown that is drawn on the head of Ahura Mazda in the carvings of the coronation in Naqsh-e Rustam and it is not known whether Ahura Mazda's crown is adapted from Ardashir's or vice versa. His beliefs are revealed behind his coins by visualizing the fire temple. His projecting pictures in Firuzabad, Naqsh-e Rustam and Naqsh-e Rajab have shown him close to Ahura Mazda. The latter's attention towards Ardashir has been known as khvarenah due to the mythical Iranian thoughts and it can be compared to the Greek [...] "tuxeh" [...] and the Roman [...] "fortuna". Ardashir's khvarenah status shows the legitimacy of his reign. Founding the fire temples and giving budget to them along with considering Zoroastrian religious texts was another way for Ardashir to gain legitimacy. A special fire temple called [...] "Ardashir's Fire" [...] was founded in the beginning of his reign that is named in his inscriptions in Bishapur. In the Meadows of Gold, Al-Masudi has attributed some words to him:Remember that religion and reign are two brothers <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> exist without the other; because religion is the basis of reign and reign is the supporter of religion. Whatsoever does not stand on a basis will be doomed and whatever does not have a supporter will deteriorate.Ardashir's policy against non-Mazda worshiping societies inside his kingdom had made it a difficult period for them. The Jews and believers in some other religions were more or less tolerated in the Parthian era and also had limited independence. Ardashir and his son Shapur, especially in the beginning of his reign, tried to limit the Jews' autonomy and deprive them of their independent judiciary and legal rights. The purpose of those actions might have been to extend the Zoroastrian society. The Syriac-language Christians were treated with more tolerance and leniency and their population increased until mid-third century. Mani did not reveal his propaganda until Ardashir's death; he might have realized that Shapur was more convincing than his father.|$|E
6000|$|There is an honored old {{tradition}} that the immense garden which Damascus stands in was the Garden of Eden, and modern writers have gathered up many chapters of evidence tending {{to show that}} it really was the Garden of Eden, and that the rivers Pharpar and Abana are the [...] "two rivers" [...] that watered Adam's Paradise. It may be so, but it is not paradise now, and one would be as happy outside of it as he would be likely to be within. It is so crooked and cramped and dirty <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> realize that he is in the splendid city he saw from the hill-top. The gardens are hidden by high mud-walls, and the paradise is become a very sink of pollution and uncomeliness. Damascus has plenty of clear, pure water in it, though, and this is enough, of itself, to make an Arab think it beautiful and blessed. Water is scarce in blistered Syria. We run railways by our large cities in America; in Syria they curve the roads so as to make them run by the meagre little puddles they call [...] "fountains," [...] and which are not found oftener on a journey than every four hours. But the [...] "rivers" [...] of Pharpar and Abana of Scripture (mere creeks,) run through Damascus, and so every house and every garden have their sparkling fountains and rivulets of water. With her forest of foliage and her abundance of water, Damascus must be a wonder of wonders to the Bedouin from the deserts. Damascus is simply an oasis--that is what it is. For four thousand years its waters have not gone dry or its fertility failed. Now we can understand why the city has existed so long. It could not die. So long as its waters remain to it away out there in the midst of that howling desert, so long will Damascus live to bless the sight of the tired and thirsty wayfarer.|$|E
