25|$|City leaders {{wanted to}} {{alleviate}} traffic congestion in the city. The Manchester Bridge and Point Bridge {{met at the}} point {{in a way that}} left no room for the interchange required by the volume of traffic. The growth of the city had made parking a serious problem as well. Robert Moses, who had developed the traffic scheme for New York City, was brought in and published a <b>traffic</b> <b>plan</b> in 1939. He offered a circular park surrounded by approach roads connecting the bridges to the city. His plan retained the existing bridges, but most of the experts brought in to examine the problem called for the bridges to be relocated away from the Point, creating more space for adjoining access roads and interchanges.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of exceptional traffic volumes, an emergency <b>traffic</b> <b>plan</b> {{was put into}} effect shortly after the strike officially began. Weekdays from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. EST, Manhattan south of 96th street, {{as well as all}} MTA tunnels and bridges, were subject to HOV-4 restrictions; that is, vehicles must contain a minimum of four passengers, and commercial trucks and vans were prohibited. To increase car capacities, carpool staging areas were set up. Alternate side of the street parking rules had been suspended. The HOV car restrictions changed much of the commuting schedules of thousands of motorists. Significantly more inbound vehicles used the Manhattan crossings from 4 to 5 a.m. and after 11 a.m. for the duration for the strike, compared to before the strike. Additionally, during 5 to 11 a.m., inbound strike traffic on Manhattan crossings was reduced compared to regular traffic. The HOV-4 restrictions significantly reduced vehicle traffic into the Manhattan central business district compared to the HOV-2 restrictions during the 1980 strike.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the rise}} of the automobile, most {{subsequent}} plans for the Arroyo Seco included a roadway, though they differed as to the purpose: some, influenced by the City Beautiful movement, concentrated on the park, while others, particularly those backed by the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC), had as their primary purpose a fast road connecting the two cities. The first plan that left the Arroyo Seco in South Pasadena to better serve downtown Pasadena was drawn up by Pasadena City Engineer Harvey W. Hincks in 1916 and supported by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and ACSC. Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Harland Bartholomew's 1924 Major Street <b>Traffic</b> <b>Plan</b> for Los Angeles, while concentrating on traffic relief, and noting that the Arroyo Seco Parkway would be a major highway, suggested that it be built as a parkway, giving motorists [...] "a great deal of incidental recreation and pleasure".

40|$|City {{development}} faces a new paradigm: {{it is now}} {{fundamental to}} take into deep consideration the environmental problems and therefore propose new solutions for city developing that seeks to solve these problems. The concept of thinking that cities can be smart, by using technological solutions {{as a way to}} solve environmental problems, is today broadly used in city planning. This concept is called Smart City. This project aims to contribute to a wise implementation of smart technologies so Smart Cities can achieve their purpose. The project identifies some implementation problems concerning the new city bike of Copenhagen, a technology we argue to be smart. This leads to the understanding that a set of criteria for smart <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> is fundamental for a good implementation of smart technologies. Hence the project seeks to draw some criteria for Smart <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> taking into consideration various aspects. These criteria are based on knowledge achieved by investigating the concept of Smart City, the city bike project and the stakeholders involved. Furthermore David Banister’s proposal for sustainable <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> and Frank W. Geels’ socio- technical system theory are studied to draw the criteria. By using these criteria it is analysed how the new city bike of Copenhagen was implemented and how its implementation can be optimised. It is argued that by using a critical realism perspective as a science study approach, the drawn criteria for smart <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> are valid as a tool for improving implementation of smart technologies. The criteria are done openly which insure that they can be used for smart <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> in other relevant contexts...|$|R

40|$|As {{decision}} support tools are developed to support controllers in complex {{air traffic control}} environments, new approaches to maintaining situation awareness and managing <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> must be developed to handle the ever-increasing amounts of alerting and advisory data.

The Enroute Descent Advisor (EDA) {{is a set of}} {{decision support}} tool capabilities for managing high-density en route traffic subject to metering restrictions. The EDA system s novel approach builds aircraft plans from combinations of user intent data and builds controller plans from combinations of aircraft plans to effectively maintain situation awareness during <b>traffic</b> <b>planning.</b> By maintaining both active (current) and provisional (proposed) controller plans, EDA supports controllers in coordinated <b>traffic</b> <b>planning</b> both within and between sectors.
