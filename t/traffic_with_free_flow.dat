40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} if institutional investors influence corporate payout policies. Specifically, this study tests whether institutional investors encourage higher payouts in firms <b>with</b> higher <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> and poor growth opportunities. Firm and year fixed effect regressions examining the effect of changes in institutional investor levels to subsequent changes in payout levels are used. For robustness, difference-GMM regressions and regressions for different time periods are performed on the same relationship. Increased institutional ownership leads to increases in total payouts, especially in firms <b>with</b> high <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> and poor investment opportunities (low q). According to agency-based <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> theory, stockholders should prefer that the management of firms <b>with</b> higher <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> and poor investment opportunities increase payouts to shareholders. The results indicate that institutional shareholders reduce agency costs by encouraging management to raise payouts, thus benefiting institutional investors and non-institutional shareholders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{most large}} for-profit {{entities}} often operating as companies, firm affaires are handled by professional managers who are legal representatives of shareholders {{and in these}} types of firms, management and ownership are separated in practice. Managers may attempt to fulfill expected profit through discretionary accruals because manipulation of non-discretionary accruals is nearly impossible. Based on Jenson research, in companies <b>with</b> high <b>free</b> cash <b>flows</b> and low growth, managers likely engage in earnings management {{in order to fulfill}} their self-interest. Thus {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship between earnings management and <b>free</b> cash <b>flows</b> in firms <b>with</b> high <b>free</b> cash <b>flows</b> and low growth. For testing research hypotheses, the required data were collected from 63 companies listed in Tehran Securities Exchange. Data analysis was conducted using three methods of linear regression, Pearson analysis, and variance analysis and showed that there was a direct significant relationship between discretionary accruals and <b>free</b> cash <b>flows.</b> Also based on Jensen theory and other related research, there was also a direct relationship between discretionary accruals and <b>free</b> cash <b>flows</b> in Iranian firms <b>with</b> high <b>free</b> cash <b>flows</b> and low growth...|$|R
