5|$|The U.S. {{government}} did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> level, orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack.

The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E
5|$|The ADF shares {{responsibility}} for counter-terrorism with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under the Australian National Counter-Terrorism Plan the State and Territory police and emergency services have the primary {{responsibility for}} responding to any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be 'called out' to provide support. To meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite Tactical Assault Groups, the Special Operations Engineer Regiment {{as well as a}} company-sized high readiness group in each Army Reserve brigade and the 1st Commando Regiment. While these forces provide a substantial counter-terrorism capability, the ADF does not regard domestic security as being part of its 'core business'.|$|E

25|$|Finland had not {{experienced}} terrorist attacks and had faced very little political violence {{since the end}} of World War II. On 14 June 2017, the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) assessed the overall <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> as level two ("elevated") on its four-tier system. According to Supo, the most significant <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> in Finland was at the time posed by individual actors or small groups motivated by radical Islamist propaganda or terrorist organisations encouraging them. Europol's assessment of terrorism threats in the European Union (EU) was similar to that of Supo:The <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> in the EU in 2016 emanated from remotely directed individuals operating alone or in small groups, and those that may have been inspired by terrorist propaganda, but not directed. The former are receiving direction and personal instruction from, and are possibly being facilitated by, a terrorist organisation. The latter are individual attackers, possibly but not necessarily being helped by family and/ or friends as accomplices. They are inspired by jihadist propaganda and messaging, but not necessarily receiving personal direction or instruction from any group.|$|E

25|$|New {{concerns}} {{arose in}} 2005 after a fake <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> case. A police officer, dissatisfied with his commanders, anonymously called an emergency line stating {{that he had}} planted a bomb in a cargo train crossing the Kiev Reservoir's dam. An immediate check proved the threat to be fake and the alerter was arrested. But the incident caused another wave of public concern.|$|E
25|$|In late 2001, the Directorate against Terrorism {{reported}} that the Shining Path, a terrorist movement which has been active since the eighties, was organizing along new fronts and infiltrating protests, blocking highways, and organizing student marches.

25|$|Additionally, the Service is the {{responsible}} authority for {{national and international}} cooperation {{in the fight against}} terrorism, for preparing and maintaining <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> assessments, for monitoring extremist phenomena, and for performing security clearances for personnel recruited into sensitive positions. Supo reports to other security authorities and the Government of Finland on its activities. According to the Police Act, Supo can utilize, among others, traffic data monitoring, covert intelligence gathering, undercover activities, pseudo purchases, and controlled delivery to fulfill its mission.|$|E
25|$|According to {{information}} {{released by the}} Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) on 19 August, the suspect attacker {{was not one of}} the 350 inviduals monitored by Supo for terrorism prevention purposes. Likewise, the suspect attacker's profile {{is similar to that of}} several other recent radical Islamist terror attacks that have taken place in Europe and Supo considers the incident to be the first suspected terrorist strike in Finland. The <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat</b> assessment level would remain unchanged from level two ("elevated") for the time being.|$|E
25|$|Michael Bloomberg, {{the mayor}} of New York City, praised the New York City Police Department. Other local {{politicians}} also praised law enforcement and expressed relief.

NISA is considered a professional Somali security force that can be relied upon to neutralize the <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat.</b> This force responded to the complex al-Shabaab attack on the Banadir Regional Courthouse in Mogadishu which killed 25 civilians. NISA's response however saved 100s and resulted in the death of all the al-Shabaab guerrillas involved.|$|E
25|$|On Election Day, {{the result}} hinges on Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Ohio. Contrary to the Underwoods' desired plans, the early returns seem to favor Conway. Underwood's {{political}} machine stages {{a terrorist attack}} in Knoxville, Tennessee, which is pinned on a local suspected ICO sympathizer. With Pennsylvania secured by Conway and Ohio seeming to swing his way, Frank unofficially calls Conway directly to concede. However, this is merely a tactic to put Conway off guard, as the Underwoods contact Ohio's governor and convince him to close the polls early on the pretense of a <b>terrorist</b> <b>threat.</b> Ohio and Tennessee refuse to certify the election, and neither candidate reaches the requisite number of electoral votes.|$|E

He was arrested in New York in 2002 and later deported to Syria where he was tortured in a Syrian jail. The government also gave official apologies. Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day criticized the U.S. authorities for not removing Arar on a terrorist watch list based on information from the CIA. U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins replied that Canada must not dictate to the United States on who is not allowed in the country.|$|E
