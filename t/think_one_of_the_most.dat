B. J. Novak called the dress-up experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, I <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Scott Borchetta, CEO of Big Machine Records, signed Swift to {{his newly}} formed label. Early into the album production, {{in a meeting}} where Borchetta and Swift {{discussed}} potential songs for Swift's debut album, she performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] for Borchetta on fluke ukulele. According to Swift, as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song, he faced Swift and said, [...] "That's your first single." [...] She responded, [...] "Well. That's how that works then." [...] Prior to that event, Swift {{did not believe that}} the song was single material. However, she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct. Swift placed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her. The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19, 2006. In retrospect, Swift has said that the song [...] "is reminiscent, and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost. I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn't... That was a really good song to start out on, {{because a lot of people}} can relate to wanting something you can't have." [...] When the song's subject discovered it, he thought it was [...] "cool" [...] and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup.|$|E

[...] Keyboardist Mic Michaeli was soon recruited to play in live concerts, and became an official member of the band shortly after. At the same time, Tony Reno was fired because of his lack of motivation and alleged slacking off on rehearsals. Bassist Peter Olsson also claims that Reno was replaced on the albums by a drum machine. His replacement was Ian Haugland.|$|E

[...] Is that your opinion?--Perfectly. That seems somewhat inconsistent with what I have been saying, but I mean there, the noblest efforts of the time at which they are produced. I would take the greatest pains to get an example of eleventh century work, though the painting is perfectly barbarous at that time.|$|E

60|$|The city of Buenos Ayres is large; and I should <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> regular in the world. (6/10. It is said {{to contain}} 60,000 inhabitants. Monte Video, the second town of {{importance}} {{on the banks of}} the Plata, has 15,000.) Every street is at right angles to the one it crosses, and the parallel ones being equidistant, the houses are collected into solid squares of equal dimensions, which are called quadras. On the other hand, the houses themselves are hollow squares; all the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard. They are generally only one story high, with flat roofs, which are fitted with seats, and are much frequented by the inhabitants in summer. In the centre of the town is the Plaza, where the public offices, fortress, cathedral, etc., stand. Here also, the old viceroys, before the revolution, had their palaces. The general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable architectural beauty, although none individually can boast of any.|$|E
60|$|These are awful words enough--that God should {{hate and}} loathe what {{he himself had}} appointed; that what would be, one would <b>think,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> natural and most {{pleasant}} sights to a loving Father in heaven--namely, his own children worshipping, blessing, and praising him--should be horrible in his sight. There is something very shocking in that; at least to Church people like us. If we were Dissenters, who go to chapel chiefly to hear sermons, {{it would be easy}} for us to say--'Of course, forms and ceremonies and appointed feasts are nothing to begin with; they are man's invention at best, and may therefore be easily enough an abomination to God.' But we know that they are not so; that forms and ceremonies and appointed feasts are good things {{as long as they have}} spirit and truth in them; that whether or not they be of man's invention, they spring out of the most simple, wholesome wants of our human nature, which is a good thing and not a bad one, for God made it in his own likeness, and bestowed it on us. We know, or ought to know, that appointed feast days, like Christmas, are good and comfortable ordinances, which cheer our hearts on our way through this world, and give us something noble and lovely to look forward to month after month; that they are like landmarks along the road of life, reminding us of what God has done, and is doing, for us and all mankind. And if you do not know, I know, that people who throw away ordinances and festivals end, at least in a generation or two, in throwing away the Gospel truth which that ordinance or festival reminds us of; just as too many who have thrown away Good Friday have thrown away the Good Friday good news, that Christ died for all mankind; and too many who have thrown away Christmas are throwing away--often without meaning to do so--the Christmas good news, that Christ really took on himself the whole of our human nature, and took the manhood into God.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{all that}} being the too {{well-known}} product of our method of vocal education--the mouth merely operating on the tongue of the pupil, and teaching him to wag it {{in a particular way}} (laughter)--it had made a great many thinking men entertain a very great distrust of this not very salutary way of procedure, and they have longed for some kind of practical way of working out the business. There would be room for a great deal of description about it if I went into it; but I must content myself with saying that the most remarkable piece of reading that you may be recommended to take and try if you can study is a book by Goethe--one of his last books, which he wrote when he was an old man, about seventy years of age--I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beautiful he ever wrote, full of mild wisdom, and which is found to be very touching by those who have eyes to discern and hearts to feel it. It is one of the pieces in [...] "Wilhelm Meister's Travels." [...] I read it through many years ago; and, of course, I had to read into it very hard when I was translating it (applause), and it has always dwelt in my mind as about the most remarkable bit of writing that I have known to be executed in these late centuries. I have often said, there are ten pages of that which, if ambition had been my only rule, I would rather have written than have written all the books that have appeared since I came into the world. (Cheers.) Deep, deep is the meaning of what is said there. They turn on the Christian religion and the religious phenomena of Christian life--altogether sketched out in the most airy, graceful, delicately-wise kind of way, so as to keep himself out of the common controversies of the street and of the forum, yet to indicate what was the result of things he had been long meditating upon. Among others, he introduces, in an aërial, flighty kind of way, here and there a touch which grows into a beautiful picture--a scheme of entirely mute education, at least with no more speech than is absolutely necessary for what they have to do.|$|E
