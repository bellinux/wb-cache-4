30|$|Hypertension {{is closely}} related to {{cardiovascular}} diseases. Mechanisms that impair the vasodilatation of blood vessels {{may play a role in}} this disease. Redox-reactive hydrocarbons in diesel engine emissions can inhibit the activity of the enzyme that synthesises NO, which may lead to a lowering of the NO level and reduced vasodilatory capacity [26]. CYP 450 -catalysed epoxidation of fatty acid has a role to play in the endothelial-derived hyperpolarisation factor (EDHF) [27], which is relevant to vasodilatation. Disturbances by reactive oxygene species (ROS) and Ah receptor-active substances interfere with the activity of CYP 450 enzymes (e.g. lower CYP induction), impairing the EDHF and thus the desired vasodilatation. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in airborne <b>dust,</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoke, and diesel soot contain Ah receptor-active substances and also cause hypertension in this way [28]; in addition, diesel soot increases ROS production to produce corresponding effects [29].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Contaminants {{encountered}} in many households, such as environmental <b>tobacco</b> smoke, house <b>dust</b> mite, cockroach, {{cat and dog}} dander, and mold, are risk factors in asthma. Young children are a particularly vulnerable subpopulation for environmentally mediated asthma, and the economic burden associated with this disease is substantial. Certain mechanical interventions are effective both in reducing allergen loads {{in the home and}} in improving asthmatic children’s respiratory health. RESULTS: Combinations of interventions including the use of dust mite-impermeable bedding covers, improved cleaning practices, high-efficiency particulate air vacuum cleaners, mechanical ventilation, and parental education are associated with both asthma trigger reduction and improved health outcomes for asthmatic children. Compared with valuated health benefits, these combinations of interventions have proven cost effective in studies that have employed them. Education alone has not proven effective in changing parental behaviors such as smoking in the home.

40|$|Exposure to {{indoor air}} {{pollutants}} such as <b>tobacco</b> smoke and <b>dust</b> mites may exacerbate childhood asthma. Environmental interventions to reduce exposures to these pollutants {{can help prevent}} exacerbations of the disease. Among the most important interventions is the elimination of environmental tobacco smoke from the environments of children with asthma.

Primary prevention of asthma is not as well understood. It is anticipated that efforts to reduce smoking during pregnancy could reduce the incidence of asthma in children. European studies have suggested that reducing exposure to food and house dust mite antigens during lactation and for the first 12 months of life diminishes the development of allergic disorders in infants with high total IgE in the cord blood and a family history of atopy.

Castor bean allergy has been described not only in laboratory workers, but also in personnel working in oil processing mills, fertilizer retail, the upholstery industry and other industrial fields. In the present study, we describe the critical amino acids in the IgE-binding epitopes in Ric c 1 and Ric c 3, two major allergens of R. communis. In addition, we also investigate the cross-reactivity between castor bean and some air and food allergen extracts commonly used in allergy diagnosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The IgE reactivity of human sera from atopic patients was screened by immune-dot blot against castor bean allergens. Allergenic activity was evaluated in vitro using a rat mast cell activation assay and by ELISA. Cross-reactivity was observed between castor bean allergens and extracts from shrimp, fish, gluten, wheat, soybean, peanut, corn, house <b>dust,</b> <b>tobacco</b> and airborne fungal allergens. We observed that treatment of rat and human sera (from atopic patients) with glutamic acid reduced the IgE-epitope interaction.

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer in the sinonasal tract is rare, but {{persons who}} have been occupationally exposed to wood dust have a {{substantially}} increased risk. It {{has been estimated that}} approximately 3. 6 million workers are exposed to inhalable wood dust in EU. In previous small studies of this cancer, ras mutations were suggested to be related to wood dust exposure, but these studies were too limited to detect statistically significant associations. Methods We examined 174 cases of sinonasal cancer diagnosed in Denmark in the period from 1991 to 2001. To ensure uniformity, all histological diagnoses were carefully reviewed pathologically before inclusion. Paraffin embedded tumour samples from 58 adenocarcinomas, 109 squamous cell carcinomas and 7 other carcinomas were analysed for K- ras codon 12, 13 and 61 point mutations by restriction fragment length polymorphisms and direct sequencing. Information on occupational exposure to wood dust and to potential confounders was obtained from telephone interviews and from registry data. Results Among the patients in this study, exposure to wood dust was associated with a 21 -fold increased risk of having an adenocarcinoma than a squamous cell carcinoma compared to unexposed [OR = 21. 0, CI = 8. 0 – 55. 0]. K- ras was mutated in 13 % of the adenocarcinomas (seven patients) and in 1 % of squamous cell carcinomas (one patient). Of these eight mutations, five mutations were located in the codon 12. The exact sequence change of remaining three could not be identified unambiguously. Among the five identified mutations, the G→A transition was the most common, and it was present in tumour tissue from two wood dust exposed adenocarcinoma patients and one patient with unknown exposure. Previously published studies of sinonasal cancer also identify the GGT → GAT transition as the most common and often related to wood dust exposure. Conclusion Patients exposed to wood dust seemed more likely to develop adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinomas. K- ras mutations were detected in 13 % of adenocarcinomas. In this study and previously published studies of sinonasal cancer the found K- ras mutations, were almost exclusively G → A transitions. In conclusion, our study, based on a large representative collection of human SNC tumours, indicates that K- ras mutations are relatively infrequent, and most commonly occur in adenocarcinomas. Wood dust exposure alone was not found to be explanatory for the G→A mutations, but combination of exposure to <b>tobacco,</b> wood <b>dust,</b> and possibly other occupational agents may be a more likely explanation.

Gravimetric method was used to determine the <b>tobacco</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations in the emission sources an also indoor workplace. A local exhaust ventilation system was designed according to the velocity pressure method recommended by ACGIH. Mean <b>tobacco</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations (ranged from 23. 56 to 432. 59 µgm- 3) were higher than TLV-TWA in the proximity of all indoor emission sources where some individuals were working. However, mean indoor and outdoor <b>tobacco</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations (7. 71 and 0. 04 µgm- 3 respectively) were lower than TLV-TWA. Totally 5 separated ventilation systems and 5 centrifugal fans were designed and selcted to pull the air through 46 different hoods. Some downward slot hoods similar to VS- 708 type were designed for the work-tables in tipping unit and some upward slot hoods that are similar to VS- 903 type recommended by ACGIH's industrial ventilation committee were also selected for tipping manipulation unit. Some enclosing hoods were designed for feeders. Duct velocity of 1060 mmin- 1 has been selected for all systems. Total air flow rates ranged from 240 - 369 m 3 min- 1.

40|$|Background: Comparisons of {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (HRQOL) between persons with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and adults in the general population are not well described. Aims: To examine associations between COPD and four measures of HRQOL in a population-based sample. Patients & Methods: These relationships were examined using data from 13, 887 adults aged > 18 years who participated in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducted in North Carolina (NC). Logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted relative odds (aOR). Results: The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD among NC adults was 5. 4 % (standard error 0. 27). Nearly half of adults with COPD reported fair/poor health compared with 15 % of those without the condition (age-aOR, 5. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 4. 4 to 6. 8). On average, adults with COPD reported twice as many unhealthy days (physical/mental) as those without the condition. The age-adjusted prevalence of > 14 unhealthy days during the prior 30 days was 45 % for adults with COPD and 17 % for those without. The aOR of > 14 unhealthy days was 1. 7 (95 % CI, 1. 4 to 2. 2) times greater among adults with COPD compared with those without. Conclusions: These results suggest COPD is independently associated with lower levels of HRQOL and reinforce the importance of preventing COPD and its complications through health education messages stressing efforts to reduce total personal exposure to <b>tobacco</b> smoke, occupational <b>dusts</b> and chemicals, and other indoor and outdoor air pollutants linked to COPD and early disease recognition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A nested {{case-control study}} for lung cancer was {{performed}} on a cohort of 2260 South African gold miners in whom an association between exposure to silica dust and risk of lung cancer was previously reported. The objective was to investigate an expanded set of risk factors and also cancer cell type. METHODS: The 78 cases of lung cancer found during the follow up period from 1970 to 1986 were matched with 386 controls. Risk of lung cancer was related to smoking, exposure to silica dust, incidence of silicosis, and uranium production and the uranium content of the mine ore. RESULTS: The risk of lung cancer was associated with <b>tobacco</b> smoking, cumulative <b>dust</b> exposure, duration of underground mining, and with silicosis. The best predictive model included pack years of cigarette consumption (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1. 0 for < 6. 5 pack years, 3. 5 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 7 to 16. 8) for 6. 5 - 20 pack years, 5. 7 (95 % CI 1. 3 to 25. 8) for 21 - 30 pack years, and 13. 2 (95 % CI 3. 1 to 56. 2) for more than 30 pack years) and silicosis (RR = 2. 45 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 5. 2)). No association was found with uranium production. The lung tumour cell type distribution was 40. 3 % small cell carcinoma, 38. 8 % squamous cell, 16. 4 % adenocarcinoma, and 4. 5 % large cell carcinoma. Small and large cell cancer combined were associated with exposure to dust. CONCLUSIONS: The results cannot be interpreted definitively in terms of causal association. Possible interpretations are: (1) subjects with high dust exposure who develop silicosis {{are at increased risk}} of lung cancer; (2) high levels of exposure to silica dust on its own is important in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and silicosis is coincidental; and (3) high levels of silica dust exposure may be a surrogate for the exposure to radon daughters. ...|$|R
