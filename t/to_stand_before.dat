Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until he is unable <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> watching as Terrel and several other students stomp on him. When a social worker urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, stating that reporting them will not solve anything. The following day, Chiron smashes a chair over Terrel's back and is subsequently arrested. As the police escort Chiron out of school, he glares at Kevin.|$|E
25|$|After being {{informed}} {{he needed}} to attend a hearing on a felony child abuse charge, Jorge Barahona tried twice to injure himself. He first jumped backward off of a sink in his cell, landing on his head. He was examined and declared competent <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> a judge, but refused to cooperate with deputies and {{did not show up}} for the hearing. At the hearing, his bail was set for $1 million. He later attempted again to injure himself and was taken to a hospital for a CT scan, then returned to jail and placed in the mental health unit.|$|E

25|$|Among the Horseman's Word {{group in}} Angus, {{initiation}} ceremonies typically {{took place at}} night, preferably {{at the time of}} the full moon, in an isolated barn, byre, stable, or steading. An individual known as the High Horseman would be seated in this space, holding a cloven goat's hoof in his hand; he would preside over the ceremony. The apprentice was then stripped to the waste and blindfolded, and spun around by his fellows in order to disorient him before being brought into the ceremonial space and made <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the High Horseman. The High Horseman asked a series of set questions of his fellows at which they responded with a series of set answers. Turning to the initiate, who I made to kneel and has his blindfold removed, the High Horseman then commanded the newcomer to provide vows to keep to the group's secrets. This achieved, all those assembled then recited the Horseman's Creed, which reminded them of the punishments that should befall them should they break their vows. Following the ceremony, a ceilidh was held in which toasts were made and the assembled horsemen drank from whisky that the apprentice had been required to bring with him.|$|E
500|$|By mid-July, {{there were}} serious provincial revolts in Mary's favour {{and support for}} Jane in the council fell. As Mary was proclaimed queen, Dudley, Ridley, Cheke, and Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk were imprisoned. However, no action was taken against the archbishop. On 8 August he led Edward's funeral {{according}} to the rites of the Prayer Book. During these months, he advised others, including Peter Martyr, to flee England, but he himself chose to stay. Reformed bishops were removed from office and conservative clergy, such as Edmund Bonner, had their old positions restored. Cranmer did not go down without a fight. When rumours spread that he authorised {{the use of the}} mass in Canterbury Cathedral, he declared them to be false and said, [...] "...all the doctrine and religion, by our said sovereign lord king Edward VI is more pure and according to God's word, than any that hath been used in England these thousand years." [...] Not surprisingly, the government regarded Cranmer's declaration as tantamount to sedition. He was ordered <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> the council in the Star Chamber on 14 September and on that day he said his final goodbye to Martyr. Cranmer was sent straight to the Tower to join Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley.|$|E
500|$|The artwork's storyline {{centers around}} [...] "Dropout Bear", West's {{anthropomorphic}} teddy bear mascot. The illustrations chronicle Dropout Bear overcoming various obstacles {{in an effort}} to reach his college campus in time for his graduation ceremony. The story begins on a rainy day with Dropout being awoken by his alarm clock and running out of his apartment to his car, modeled after a DeLorean. When the car's engine dies, he is forced to find an alternative means of transportation. Dropout attempts to hail a cab but it speeds right past him, soaking him with puddle water. He then tries to get onto a metro rail but just misses it as it pulls away. Left with no other options, Dropout is reduced to pursuing his goal on foot. As he races down sidewalks, populated by multi-eyed, living mushrooms, Dropout is pursued by a monstrous rain cloud that attempts to swallow him whole. Eventually, Dropout Bear arrives at the university and makes it to his ceremony just in time <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>before</b> his colleagues, a wide variety of anthropomorphic creatures like himself. The visual story concludes with Dropout Bear being shot out of a cannon from the university into the sky into another stratosphere on the back cover. The cover art for Graduation was cited as the fifth best album cover of the year by Rolling Stone. The designs of the album artwork were later brought to life by Takashi Murakami through the use of cel-shaded animation within a three-minute animated music video for [...] "Good Morning".|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the Strugar decision {{and its role}} in establishing the standards for a defendant’s fitness <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> trial <b>before</b> an in-ternational tribunal. While fitness <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> trial was an issue in three cases at Nuremberg, those cases failed to establish any standards for the international criminal justice community. In contrast, the Strugar standards have been followed in other Trial Chambers at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and at The Special Panels for Serious Crimes at the United Nations Tribunal at East Timor. Therefore, the author argues that Strugar may be viewed as the seminal decision on the issue of fitness <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> trial <b>before</b> an international tribunal...|$|R

What I saw in those early years of the {{development}} of this problem in Wolverhampton has made it impossible for me ever to dissociate myself from this gigantic and tragic problem". He also criticised the view that the causes of the riots were economic: [...] "Are we seriously saying that so long as there is poverty, unemployment and deprivation our cities will be torn to pieces, that the police in them will be the objects of attack and that we shall destroy our own environment? Of course not". Dame Judith Hart attacked his speech as [...] "an evil incitement to riot".
