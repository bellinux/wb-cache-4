5|$|Weber {{abandoned}} {{research into}} Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun {{work on the}} book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> comparative analysis of religion and society.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada {{should call}} on the United Nations Security Council to seriously engage itself in the {{resolution}} of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and to investigate the conduct of both parties during the conflict with respect to international law. The Government of Canada should also initiate a dialogue with the Government of Sri Lanka, in conjunction with the international community, aimed at laying <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> political reconciliation between the communities. If these efforts fail, the Government of Canada should consider financial and diplomatic sanctions, including, but not limited to, advocating for Sri Lanka’s suspension from the Commonwealth, as well as incentives.|$|E

5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill laying <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led by sitting President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won {{the support of the}} pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. After 16 days of cricket in 20 {{calendar}} days, Barnes was rested as Australia completed a 10-wicket win. Barnes returned for the following game against Gloucestershire. The tourists elected to bat first and Barnesplaying many square cutsmade 44 in an opening partnership of 102 with Morris, who went on to top-score with 290. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest score for the tour, laying <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> victory by an innings and 363 runs. When Australia was fielding, Barnes was not at his characteristic close-range position, but spent much of the time at third man or fine leg {{near the edge of the}} playing arena. At times, Barnes wandered about aimlessly between various positions, but Hassett, captaining in place of the resting Bradman, did not attempt to command him.|$|E
5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October, Baillet de Latour {{immediately}} lay <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lengthy siege {{by ordering}} {{the construction of}} extensive earthworks around the bridgehead. The lines of contravallation (the trenches nearest to the French position) included a series of redoubts connected by trenches. Initially, the French considered these to be purely defensive and they were inclined to ignore the industrious Austrian diggers and focus instead on their own fortifications, which were sketchy and relied upon palisades unprotected by dirt; these could not withstand a vigorous attack until strengthened. After several days of strengthening their outer works by 30 October, several artillery pieces were brought up to augment the outer defense. In addition, released from the main army after the Battle of Schliengen, General Dessaix arrived to command the fortress and augment the garrison with his troops. Subsequently, French reconstruction of the fortress and its defensive lines increased. Several minor sorties against the Austrian lines resulted. On 14 November 1796, Dominique Vandamme, commanding a column of Dessaix's force, directed {{a small group of}} skirmishers and hussars to attack the most forward of the Austrian posts. This successful sortie took eighty Austrian prisoners. On 21 November, while the Austrians constructed their trenches on the right bank of the Kinzig, the French planned for a considerable sortie against the lines of contravallation between the Kinzig and the Rhine.|$|E

50|$|A fourth treatise, Aristotle's Politics, {{is often}} {{regarded}} as the sequel to the Ethics, in part because Aristotle closes the Nicomachean Ethics by saying that his ethical inquiry has laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inquiry into political questions (NE X.1181b6-23).

Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. Torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of Algeria, then home to over one million European settlers, wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war.|$|E
