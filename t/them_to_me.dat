25|$|I have {{received}} a letter written on the Führer's orders requesting that the Jewish question be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved one way or another... I should {{not want to leave}} any doubt, gentlemen, as to the aim of today's meeting. We have not come together merely to talk again, but to make decisions, and I implore competent agencies to take all measures for the elimination of the Jew from the German economy, and to submit <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Christopher Tolkien, it is {{no longer}} {{possible}} to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, [...] "He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very {{near the end of his}} life, when he spoke of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and tried unsuccessfully to find them." [...] In a 1967 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|The police gave Brown £5,000 in 1993 and an {{additional}} £590 in January 2011 toward his rent; they also paid for credits for his mobile phone {{so that they could}} reach him, and paid to have his car put through an MOT test (an annual roadworthiness test). The court heard that Brown had also been also [...] "made aware" [...] by police that the Sun newspaper had offered a £100,000 reward. He told the police in 1993 that he had difficulty identifying black people: [...] "I can't tell the difference between <b>them.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> a black man is a black man." ...|$|E

'But if you've got any poor people as wants help, and you know's deservin', send <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> send <b>'em</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> just the same.' ...|$|R

500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane. Dowd first heard the band rehearsing while visiting Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, asking their name and {{remarking}} to Walden, [...] "Get them {{the hell out of}} there and give <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the studio. They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce their second album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd. In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{commentary}} for Rejected on the Bitter Films Vol. 1 DVD, Hertzfeldt stated that [...] "You {{never want to}} lie to your audience... you can trick them, you can disturb them, you can annoy them, but you can never lie to <b>them.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> commercials are nothing but lies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly commented [...] "I {{realized}} I didn't want {{to compose}} pictures … I {{wanted to find}} them. I felt that my vision was choosing things {{out there in the}} world and presenting <b>them.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> the investigation of perception was of the greatest interest. There was so much to see, and it all looked fantastic to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{battle was}} decisive — in one single engagement, Cao Cao {{had broken the}} back of Wuhuan resistance. With a few {{thousand}} horses, the Yuan brothers and the surviving Wuhuan leaders, Supuyan (蘇僕延), Louban, Wuyan and others, fled east to Liaodong (遼東; eastern Liaoning), where the warlord Gongsun Kang enjoyed some degree of independence from the Han imperial court due to Liaodong's distance from the capital and the chaotic state in China. In the ninth lunar month Cao Cao continued his march into Liucheng, and there he halted, making no intention to attack Liaodong despite the urgings of his subordinates. [...] "I shall arrange that Gongsun Kang cuts off the heads of Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi and sends <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> No need to bother with soldiers," [...] he said. He later explained that applying pressure to Liaodong may bind Yuan Shang and Gongsun Kang against him, but if he left them to their devices, they would quarrel within.|$|E
2500|$|On this {{particular}} instance, {{the captain was}} piloting the landing and said, [...] "All right. Give <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on the flare. I have given up." [...] This was not their usual routine. Sixty feet from the runway, the captain began to reduce power {{in preparation for the}} flare and said, [...] "Okay" [...] to the first officer. The first officer immediately deployed the spoilers on the flare, instead of just arming them. The aircraft began to sink heavily and the captain, realizing what had happened, pulled back on the control column and applied full thrust to all four engines. The nose lifted, but the aircraft still continued to sink, hitting the runway with enough force that the number four engine and pylon broke off the wing. There was also a tail strike at this time. Realizing what he had done, the first officer began apologizing to the captain. Apparently unaware of the severity of the damage inflicted on the aircraft, the crew managed to lift off for a go-around, but the lost fourth engine had torn off a piece of the lower wing plating and the aircraft was now trailing fuel, which ignited. The first officer requested a second landing attempt on the same runway but was told it was closed due to debris and was directed to another runway.|$|E
