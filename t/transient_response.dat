5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|Fast <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> and low {{distortion}} {{are both}} characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E

The method of reverberation ray matrix (MRRM) is extended {{to study the}} stress wave propagation in the lattice {{sandwich plate}} with various boundaries. Displacement wave solutions of the lattice sandwich panel under arbitrary boundaries are obtained based on the first order shear deformation theory, and the broadband excitation responses can be determined. The reverberation ray matrix can be derived by using the wave solutions, boundary conditions and dual coordinates of the lattice sandwich panel. Through the fast Fourier transform algorithm (FFT), the broadband impact <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> of the lattice sandwich panel under various boundaries are obtained.

40|$|In this paper, a PVDF film sensor {{was used}} to measure the <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> of a {{cantilever}} beam subjected to an impact loading. The measurement capability of a PVDF sensor is affected by the area of the PVDF film sensor and the signal conditioner (charge amplifier). The influences of these effects on the experimental measurements were investigated. The <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> for the dynamic strain of the beam were measured simultaneously by the PVDF sensor and a conventional strain gauge. The resonant frequencies of the beam were determined by applying the Fast Fourier Transform on transient results in the time domain of the PVDF sensor and the strain gauge. The experimentally measured resonant frequencies from the PVDF sensor and the strain gauge were compared with those predicted from theoretical and FEM numerical calculations. Based on the comparison of the results measured for these two sensors, the PVDF film sensor proved capable of measuring <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> for dynamic strain, and its sensitivity is better than that of the strain gauge.

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert Fine, Mercury Records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951. The first record, a Chicago Symphony Orchestra performance of Pictures at an Exhibition, conducted by Rafael Kubelik, was described as [...] "being in the living presence of the orchestra" [...] by The New York Times music critic. The series of records was then named Mercury Living Presence. In 1955, Mercury began three-channel stereo recordings, still {{based on the principle}} of the single microphone. The center (single) microphone was of paramount importance, with the two side mics adding depth and space. Record masters were cut directly from a three-track to two-track mixdown console, with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three-tracks. In 1961, Mercury enhanced this technique with three-microphone stereo recordings using 35mm magnetic film instead of -inch tape for recording. The greater thickness and width of 35mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print-through and pre-echo and gained extended frequency range and <b>transient</b> <b>response.</b> The Mercury Living Presence recordings were remastered to CD in the 1990s by the original producer, Wilma Cozart Fine, using the same method of three-to-two mix directly to the master recorder.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The IEC {{standard}} for onshore or offshore wind turbines requires additional dummy simulations (at least 5 s) for the <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> due to initial conditions. An {{increase in the}} dummy time causes a considerable increase in the computational cost considering multiple design spirals with several thousand design load analysis cases. A time of 30 s is typically used in practical simulations for awind turbine design with a fixed platform. However, 30 s may be insufficient for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT) because the platforms have lower natural frequencies, and the <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> will last much longer. In this paper, an initial condition application algorithm is implemented for WindHydro, and the appropriate dummy simulation time is investigated based {{on a series of}} dynamic simulations of a FOWT. As a result, it is found that more than 300 s is required for the platform to have stationary motion after the initial <b>transient</b> <b>responses</b> for the FOWT under the conditions considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} of {{a rotating}} blade {{are determined by}} operating conditions and the system parameters such as material properties of the blade and geometry.

Since {{the uncertainty of the}} system parameters leads to the uncertainty of <b>transient</b> <b>responses,</b> reliability based design needs to be conducted through the uncertainty propagation analysis of the system. For structural systems such as the rotating beam, the system parameters are random fields since the uncertainty of the parameters is the function of spatial variables.

2500|$|An evoked {{potential}} is the electrical {{response of the}} brain to a sensory stimulus. Regan constructed an analogue Fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the {{evoked potential}} to flickering (sinusoidally modulated) light. Rather than integrating the sine and cosine products, Regan fed the signals to a two-pen recorder via lowpass filters. [...] This allowed him {{to demonstrate that the}} brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics (frequency components) of the response were approximately constant over time. By analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial <b>transient</b> <b>response</b> he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential (SSEP) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase. [...] Although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms, it is more helpful to define the SSEP in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform, because different frequency components can have quite different properties. [...] For example, the properties of the high-frequency flicker SSEP (whose peak amplitude is near 40–50Hz) correspond to the properties of the subsequently discovered magnocellular neurons in the retina of the macaque monkey, while the properties of the medium-frequency flicker SSEP ( [...] whose amplitude peak is near 15–20Hz) correspond to the properties of parvocellular neurons. Since a SSEP can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more complex}} {{version of a}} Tesla coil, termed a [...] "magnifier" [...] by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core {{resonance}} [...] "driver" [...] transformer (or [...] "master oscillator") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the [...] "extra coil" [...] or simply the resonator) that has {{a large number of}} turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected {{to the bottom of the}} extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line.
