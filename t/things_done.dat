Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty.

25|$|In the praxis of Gentile's {{concrete}} thinking criteria, such {{consideration of the}} a priori toward the properly a posteriori constitutes impractical, decadent intellectualism. Moreover, this fascist philosophy occurred parallel to Actual Idealism, his philosophic system; he opposed intellectualism for its being disconnected from the active intelligence that gets <b>things</b> <b>done,</b> i.e. thought is killed when its constituent parts are labelled, and thus rendered as discrete entities.|$|E

25|$|McCray became {{involved}} in local civics organizations and served on the country school board for one term in 1890. A devastating fire struck Kentland a few years later, and the county placed him in charge of overseeing several projects to rebuilding the town. He gained a reputation for getting <b>things</b> <b>done</b> quickly and cost effectively, and ran for {{a seat on the}} town council the following year. There he successfully advocated the modernization of the town by paving the roads, building an electric plant, installing street lighting, building safer railroad crossings, and several other projects. The tax increases needed to pay for the projects turned out to be too much, and he was voted out of office after one term.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is <b>things</b> <b>done</b> by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

500|$|During the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows {{became an}} {{industry}} {{for the band}} and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher. The props used on stage by the band increased in both size and sophistication, similar to <b>things</b> <b>done</b> on Broadway. The band started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show. On this tour they had two versions what Jagger {{referred to as the}} [...] "lotus stage" [...] – one version of the stage that had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain and the other has leaves that would start in the folded up position and lower during the beginning of the concert. This period also included a variety of props, including inflatables and other gimmicks ranging from inflatable penises [...] "and things." [...] The tour also incorporated a number of circus tricks.|$|E

In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said {{that many of the}} <b>things</b> <b>done</b> by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were [...] "the very essence of a Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify. The team wanted to make a game with a rescue theme as Naka thought there were few games based on that concept. According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design a future that was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and dexterous to reach places where people were trapped.|$|E
500|$|Divine's mother, Frances Milstead, {{remarked that}} while Divine [...] "was blessed with many talents and abilities, {{he could be}} very moody and demanding." [...] She noted {{that while he was}} [...] "incredibly kind and generous", he always wanted to get <b>things</b> <b>done</b> the way that he wanted, and would [...] "tune you out if you displeased him." [...] She noted that in most interviews, he came across as [...] "a very shy and private person". Divine's Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On {{numerous}} occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine's final years, when his disco career {{was coming to an end}} and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.|$|E
500|$|Ross Perot {{appeared}} on the February 20 edition of Larry King Live on CNN, his fourth appearance on the show since 1991. After a lively interview concerning political issues, King directly asked Perot if there was [...] "any scenario in which [...] would run for president." [...] Perot firmly stated {{that he did not}} want to run, but spontaneously affirmed that he would begin a campaign if [...] "ordinary people" [...] signed petitions and helped him achieve ballot access in all 50 states. He set up a phone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to inform interested voters and supporters on how they could assist Perot's potential campaign. Supporters viewed the candidate as an [...] "action man... who can get <b>things</b> <b>done...</b> takes care of his people". They were angry at President Bush for reneging on [...] The New York Times speculated that Perot's [...] "iconoclastic, take-no-prisoners persona and anti-politics politics" [...] would appeal to the [...] "angry frustrated electorate". But Republican consultant Karl Rove characterized Perot as an [...] "untested wild man". He rejected any financial donations for more than $5, and stated that he would personally fund a potential campaign. Perot spent $400,000 of his own money in the first month, however, he largely spread this message via television, capped by a March 18 National Press Club speech, which aired on C-SPAN.|$|E

500|$|Sestak and Specter {{held their}} {{first and only}} {{televised}} debate on May 1 at Philadelphia's Fox affiliate, during which the two candidates bitterly attacked each other's character and honesty. The two began arguing even before the hour-long debate formally began, when Sestak objected to Specter's use of notes {{and said that the}} rules did not allow them. The debate organizer ruled the notes were allowed. Specter criticized Sestak for campaign advertisements that accused the Senator of lying about Sestak's record. Specter said, [...] "Nobody has ever called me a liar," [...] and demanded an apology, to which Sestak did not respond. Specter also repeatedly asked Sestak to publicly release his military records, to which Sestak again refused to respond. Sestak accused Specter of using Republican-style tactics in the vein of Karl Rove, former adviser to George W. Bush, and said Specter's attacks were meant to mask his record of supporting Bush's failed economic policies. Specter insisted the questions raised about Sestak's naval record were legitimate because much of Sestak's campaign was based on his military background, adding, [...] "It goes to his ability to get <b>things</b> <b>done,</b> to get along with people. He's all peaches and cream on television." [...] Specter criticized Sestak for supporting the troop build-up in Afghanistan, while Sestak noted that Specter voted against a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s. The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the debate was [...] "every bit as contentious as their Democratic Senate primary struggle has become in its closing days".|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test it and try to get the <b>things</b> <b>done</b> that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E
500|$|Loss {{of control}} {{is defined in}} {{sections}} 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 56 abolishes the common law defence of provocation, which also dealt only with murder. There is no mandatory life sentence for voluntary manslaughter. The defence operates whether the defendant is a principal or an accomplice. Broadly speaking, the defendant must have actually lost self-control; the trigger for {{this must be a}} qualifying trigger; and it must be that a [...] "normal" [...] person might also have lost control in the circumstances. The loss of control need not be sudden, but cannot be in a [...] "considered desired for revenge". The loss of control is a subjective test which asks whether this defendant actually lost control, and if so, whether that loss of control led to their killing. The qualifying trigger may take one of two forms, or be a combination of both: that the killing was attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence from the victim against the defendant or another identified person; or where the defendant's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or <b>things</b> <b>done</b> or said (or both) which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. The meaning of the terms [...] "extremely grave character" [...] and [...] "justifiable sense of being seriously wronged" [...] used in the second form is currently unclear. Section 51(1)(c) requires that [...] "a person of 's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of , might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to [...]" [...] These issues are complicated and directing a jury on issues of loss of control is likely to be difficult.|$|E
