There were a few variations used in episodes between 2014 and 2016. An emotional version using strings and violin, A version using trumpet and beeps and a much basic sounding version just using beeps, those <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> medical machinery. This package was used mostly until towards the end of Series 30 when a new package was slowly introduced. The original pack is still used occasionally.|$|E

We drank it all night, then headed to the studio– Jeff got on keyboards, Mark starts playing electronic drums <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Eighties Prince and I started screaming, 'Moonshine, {{take us to the}} stars!' There were a lot of nights like that".|$|E

Merrill's bass style has been {{described}} as [...] "bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb". Larkin's drumming is thought to [...] "worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham".

500|$|Punknews.org {{contributor}} GlassPipeMurder said [...] "Fast Forward to 2012" [...] was [...] "incredibly promising" [...] {{but within}} [...] "mere seconds the melodic punk {{is replaced by}} vocals <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a post-Taco Bell burrito belch". About the band playing [...] "The Price We Pay", {{he also said the}} group had fallen [...] "equally flat with their attempt at acoustic emo pop" [...] with [...] "horrifically banal lyrics". Rolling Stone magazine said the album was [...] "among the 40 most important new releases of the month".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} Oh Land's vocals, {{which range from}} G3 to D5, guitars and a piano. Andrew Leahey from AllMusic commented that the [...] "four-on-the-floor breakup anthem featur snaps, synthesizers, and background vocals <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> pan pipes". Matthew Perpetua, writing for Rolling Stone, compared its Europop sound to that of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine claimed it [...] "juxtaposes a driving 4/4 beat with accompanying madrigal-style vocal harmonies". while Fraser McAlpine of BBC opined that it [...] "appropriates some of the primal chanting and hollering of Tune-Yards, but brings in a big pop chorus".|$|E
500|$|Binaural {{opens with}} three up-tempo songs before growing more diverse. [...] Vedder explained, [...] "We'd rather {{challenge}} our fans {{and make them}} listen to our songs than give them something that's easy to digest.

[...] As described by critic Jon Pareles on his review for Rolling Stone, Pearl Jam distances itself from the grunge that made them famous and [...] "delve elsewhere: jumpy post-punk and somber meditations, tightly wound folk rock and turbulent, neopsychedelic rockers <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they boiled out of jam sessions." ...|$|E

500|$|Yeezus is {{primarily}} electronic in nature, and boasts distorted drum machines and [...] "synthesizers <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they're malfunctioning, low-resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura {{to the most}} analog sounds." [...] To this end, the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of CD skips or corrupted MP3's, and Auto-Tuned vocals are modulated to a point {{in which they are}} difficult to decipher. Esquire cites [...] "On Sight" [...] as an early example of the album's connection to electronic music, citing its [...] "droning synthesizer tone," [...] which is [...] "modulated until the signal starts throwing off harshly treble-heavy spikes and begins to clip, as if it were overloading a digital audio processor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gorilla" [...] was {{the first}} song written for the album, setting [...] "the tone for the entire project {{and it kind of}} became the mascot". This was the reason behind the gorilla {{on the cover of the}} album, as Mars {{explained}} in an interview with MTV News. In another interview, this time for GQ magazine, Mars revealed the song's conception, saying that [...] "it was just painting a picture—some animalistic sex". When asked about what the meaning is for [...] "making love like a gorilla"?, Mars replied aggressively [...] "What does <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> to you? Come on...What is this, 1933? We can't talk about this?". Regarding the line [...] "I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker", Mars said that his inspiration came [...] "just because the room was dark" [...] and he felt like Johnny Cash.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment.ie's Lauren Murphy {{regarded}} [...] "No Can Do" [...] and album track [...] "Side Chick" [...] as [...] "feeble uptempo tracks <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they've been plucked {{at random}} from a pop factory conveyor belt". A writer from the Daily Record commented that [...] "as much as [...] is mainstream and poppy, it's hardly their most remarkable offering". Popjustice considered the song to be [...] "above average" [...] {{but not the}} best track from the album, while Fraser McAlphine of the BBC Chart Blog wrote that it [...] "won't be the all-conquering pop superbeast that it could be". A positive response came from AllMusic writer Matthew Chisling, who considered the song to be a [...] "show-stopping [...] " [...] and stated that it [...] "work as shimmering displays of subtle strength". Virgin Media's Johnny Dee praised inclusion of the Motown beat, which according to him makes the song [...] "feel retro and modern simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the lines}} and scenes from the episode were {{improved}} or ad-libbed by the cast. Jenna Fischer named the party planning scene her favorite scene and called it [...] "longest most horrible meeting of all time". On the commentary track for the episode, Fischer revealed that the scene was almost entirely ad-libbed. At one point, Phyllis Smith, who portrays Phyllis Margaret Vance (née Lapin), made a joke that made every one on set laugh, forcing production to halt for almost 45 minutes. Dwight's [...] "gun show" [...] joke was written by Rainn Wilson. Larry Wilmore later called the [...] "gun show" [...] scene his favorite. Wilmore later said of ab-libs, [...] "part of the fun in writing a show like this is trying to write lines <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> ad-libs." [...] Daniels also praised the episode's lines, saying, [...] "when you know the acting is really good, it all sounds like it's been improvised." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering. Grohl {{said it was}} done that way because he felt digital recording {{was getting out of}} control: [...] "when I listen to music these days, and I hear Pro Tools and drums <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a machine- it kinda sucks the life out of music." [...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} an instrumental, {{a cover of}} Spencer Davis' [...] "Don't Want You No More," [...] which had {{previously}} been employed on set lists of the Second Coming, Oakley and Betts' former band. Allman and Betts' guitars perform in unison on a five-note melody while Johanson concentrates on his hi-hat, and the song includes an organ solo. The song contains two guitar solos, with the latter [...] " [...] in behind the first one for a darting buildup <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> something taken from Brahms." [...] It segues into a [...] "lazy blues shuffle" [...] titled [...] "It's Not My Cross to Bear," [...] which Allman had written in Los Angeles for a former lover. [...] "Black Hearted Woman," [...] also penned on the same subject, follows, and the album returns to a blues-based sound with a cover of [...] "Trouble No More," [...] featuring Duane’s debut bottleneck guitar performance. Songs such as [...] "Black Hearted Woman" [...] and [...] "Every Hungry Woman" [...] were written about Allman's experiences with a girl named Stacy in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Adult males {{communicate}} with loud bellows—low pitched sounds that consist of snore-like inhalations and resonant exhalations <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> growls. These sounds {{are thought to}} be generated by unique vocal organs found in koalas. Because of their low frequency, these bellows can travel far through air and vegetation. Koalas may bellow at any time of the year, particularly during the breeding season, when it serves to attract females and possibly intimidate other males. They also bellow to advertise their presence to their neighbours when they enter a new tree. These sounds signal the male's actual body size, as well as exaggerate it; females pay more attention to bellows that originate from larger males. [...] Female koalas bellow, though more softly, in addition to making snarls, wails, and screams. These calls are produced when in distress and when making defensive threats. Young koalas squeak when in distress. As they get older, the squeak develops into a [...] "squawk" [...] produced both when in distress and to show aggression. When another individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low grunt with its mouth closed. Koalas make numerous facial expressions. When snarling, wailing, or squawking, the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears forward. During screams, the lips retract and the ears are drawn back. Females bring their lips forward and raise their ears when agitated.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Hidden Place", which {{features}} a soprano section and strings, [...] "over {{the top of a}} warm, intimate melody". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH felt the track was reminiscent of Homogenics [...] "Hunter", but less focused on the beats. NME called it progressive folk, while Drowned in Sound wrote it was electro. Björk sings about [...] "how two people can create a paradise just by uniting", as she intones: [...] "I'm so close to tears/And so close to/Simply calling you up/And simply suggesting/We go to that hidden place". [...] "Cocoon" [...] is [...] "based around an exploratory bassline and beats <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> fingertips on skin". Discussing the glitch nature of the track, Björk said, [...] "when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it's faulty, you're entering a mystery zone where you can't control it". Lyrically revolving around making love, the song alternates between metaphors like [...] "Who would have known/That a boy like him/Would have entered me lightly/Restoring my blisses", and explicit lines such as [...] "He slides inside/Half awake, half asleep" [...] and [...] "Gorgeousness/He's still inside me". According to Michael Cragg of The Guardian, the song [...] "best represents the album's sense of heavy-lidded, post-coital hibernation". Björk sings a breathy, [...] "whispered, near-cracking falsetto" [...] on the track.|$|E
2500|$|Cri du chat, {{which is}} caused by the {{deletion}} of part of the short arm of chromosome 5. [...] "Cri du chat" [...] means [...] "cry of the cat" [...] in French; the condition was so-named because affected babies make high-pitched cries <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> those of a cat. Affected individuals have wide-set eyes, a small head and jaw, moderate to severe mental health problems, and are very short.|$|E

During Life on Mars, Hunt is described by the protagonist, Sam Tyler, as an [...] ""overweight, over-the-hill, nicotine-stained, borderline alcoholic homophobe with a superiority complex and an unhealthy obsession with male bonding" [...] (to which Hunt responded [...] "You make <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a bad thing.") The BBC explains that in Ashes to Ashes, Hunt's personality remains unchanged, apart from him [...] "losing grip on the power he had as a police officer".|$|E
2500|$|Crave Online {{called the}} song an [...] "opening throb", {{saying that the}} song [...] "sexes up the dub-flirtation with a verse hingeing on the line 'this is it, the apocalypse' and a triumphant chorus, {{with more than a}} few shades of Hip-Hop in the production", and that the song was as [...] "radio-ready as they come". Our Vinyl stated that the [...] "power of this song is {{outstanding}} with heavy drums and more of an electronic feel {{than the rest of the}} album and strong, impressive vocals from front-man Dan Reynolds which are reciprocated throughout the LP."
