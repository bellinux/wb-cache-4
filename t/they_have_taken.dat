5|$|The {{coronation}} ceremonies {{in medieval}} Christendom, both Western and Eastern, {{are influenced by}} the practice of the Roman Emperors as it developed during Late Antiquity, indirectly influenced by Biblical accounts of kings being crowned and anointed. The European coronation ceremonies, perhaps best known in the form <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> in Great Britain (the most recent of which occurred in 1953), descend from rites initially created in Byzantium, Visigothic Spain, Carolingian France and the Holy Roman Empire and brought to their apogee during the Medieval era.|$|E
5|$|Visiting {{the base}} that night, the agents witness a mysterious {{aircraft}} performing seemingly impossible maneuvers {{in the night}} sky. They flee when a black helicopter approaches, seemingly in pursuit of Emil and Zoe, a trespassing teenage couple. As Mulder treats Emil and Zoe to a meal at the diner, they tell the agents about the lights and how they believe the UFOs are launched from another nearby base. Meanwhile, Budahas is returned to his home with no memory of what happened. After leaving the diner, Mulder and Scully are confronted by black-suited agents, who destroy the photographs <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> and order them to leave town.|$|E

However, {{in addition to the}} more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E

The pair also reveal that they, not Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, {{as she was}} having an affair with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive.
