5|$|Many of {{the wounds}} inflicted by the blast were {{permanently}} debilitating, {{such as those}} caused by flying glass or by <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> the explosion. Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly {{in the path of}} glass fragments from shattered windows. Roughly 5,900 eye injuries were reported, and 41 people lost their sight permanently.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} diagram, the two {{ends of the}} train are drawn as grey lines. Because {{the ends of the}} train are {{stationary}} with respect to the observer on the train, these lines are just vertical lines, showing their motion through time but not space. <b>The</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> light is shown as the 45Â° red lines. The points at which the two light flashes hit the ends of the train are at the same level in the diagram. This means that the events are simultaneous.|$|E
25|$|In parallel, the HiPER project also {{proposes to}} build smaller laser systems with higher {{repetition}} rates. The high-powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes {{as long as}} a day. Additionally only a very small amount of <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.|$|E
25|$|In 1709, the Reverend William Derham, Rector of Upminster, {{published}} {{a more accurate}} measure {{of the speed of}} sound, at 1,072 Parisian feet per second. Derham used a telescope from the tower of the church of St Laurence, Upminster to observe <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including North Ockendon church. The distance was known by triangulation, and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.|$|E

25|$|The British {{found that}} they were at a {{disadvantage}} in night fighting as they were temporarily blinded by <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> their guns, while the Italian ships carried flashless cordite and good tracer ammunition. The escorts were blamed by the headquarters at Aden {{for a lack of}} aggression, except for Kimberley, despite the risk of abandoning the convoy at night in poor visibility. The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two units, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, had meant that neither had the firepower to face the British escorts.|$|E
25|$|The crystal scintillates in {{response}} to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron {{is similar to the}} photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> light is produced, it is detected. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This reconstructed image reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged.|$|E
25|$|Pike {{make use}} of the lateral line system to follow the {{vortices}} produced by the perceived prey, and the whirling movement of the spinner is probably a good way to imitate or exaggerate these. Jerkbaits are also effective and can produce spectacular bites with pike attacking these erratic-moving lures at full speed. For trolling, big plugs or softbaits can be used. Spoons with mirror finishes are very effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings because they generate the vibrations previously discussed and cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> white-bellied prey. Most fishermen tend to use small lures, but often that is not advisable because pike have a preference for large prey. When fishing in shallow water for smaller pike, lighter and smaller lures are frequently used. The humble 'woolly bugger' fly is a favourite lure among keen fly fisherman of the southern hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|For {{industrial}} areas, {{fires and}} lighting were simulated. It {{was decided to}} recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, carbon arc lamps were used to simulate <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> tram cables. Red lamps were used to simulate blast furnaces and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden panels. The use of diversionary techniques such as fires {{had to be made}} carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were {{similar to those of the}} German C-250 and C-500 Flammbomben. The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real target.|$|E
25|$|Mulroney, while {{publicly}} endorsing Clark at a {{press conference}} in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party's leadership review. Clark's key Quebec organizer Rodrigue Pageau was in fact a double agent, working for Mulroney, undermining Clark's support. When Clark received an endorsement by only 66.9 per cent of delegates at the party convention in January 1983 in Winnipeg, he resigned and ran to regain his post at the 1983 leadership convention. Despite still not being a member of Parliament, Mulroney ran against him, campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. Mulroney had been criticized in 1976 for lacking policy depth and substance, a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early 1980s, which were collected into a book, Where I Stand, published in 1983. Mulroney also avoided most of <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> his earlier campaign, for which he had been criticized. Mulroney was elected party leader on June 11, 1983, beating Clark on the fourth ballot, attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec. Two months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for Central Nova in Nova Scotia, winning a by-election in what was then considered a safe Tory seat, after Elmer MacKay stood aside in his favour. This is a common practice in most parliamentary systems.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard's war {{service has}} great {{significance}} in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as {{he is said to}} have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> a large-caliber gun" [...] or when he had [...] "a bomb go off in my face".

It includes cameo appearances by Anita Pallenberg and Steve Strange. It was released in September 1998, and features Madonna leaving her home and being chased by paparazzi. Dressed in black, she is constantly running, even from the other celebrities in a hotel bar. Except for Madonna's, everyone else's face is distorted. In another sequence of the clip, Madonna passes a hotel maid smiling at her. The singer returns the smile when <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> a camera goes off; the maid has just taken a picture of her.

500|$|The {{official}} {{weight of the}} shot was listed at 68lbs but in reality this varied according to the material of the shot itself; cast iron shot weighed , wrought iron shot and steel shot weighed , and chilled steel weighed [...] [...] It was estimated that one 68-pound shot had the destructive power equivalent to five 32-pound shot. The explosive shells were primed with [...] of gunpowder. They were fitted with simple fuses that were ignited by <b>the</b> <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> the charge â early wooden fuses were eventually replaced by more reliable fuses designed by Captain Edward Boxer in 1849. The gun crew still had to gauge the best length of fuse for the range they were firing â ideally the shell should explode just before hitting its target. To prevent the shell exploding in the barrel it was fitted with a sabot to ensure the fuse faced away from the charge.|$|E

[...] Louis Atayataronghta, a Mohawk warrior fighting with Herkimer's men, shot one of the enemy whose fire had been devastating in its accuracy, noting that [...] "every time he rises up he kills one of our men".|$|E
