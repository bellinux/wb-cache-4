5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, <b>tree</b> <b>swallow</b> and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that climate change has affected the breeding and distribution of wildlife. If such changes are due to global warming, then we should expect to see large-scale effects. To explore for such effects on avian reproduction, we examined 3450 nest records of <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> from across North America. The egg-laying date in <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> advanced by up to nine days during 1959 - 1991. This advance in phenology was associated with increasing surface air temperatures {{at the time of}} breeding. Our analysis controlled for several potentially confounding variables such as latitude, longitude, breeding density and elevation. We conclude that <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> across North America are breeding earlier and that the most likely cause is a long-term increase in spring temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of elaborate plumages in birds {{has traditionally been}} explained {{as a result of}} mate choice by females for these traits in males. Ornate plumage traits are thought to be costly to produce and maintain, allowing females to gain accurate information about potential mates based on the expression of these traits. Female plumage traits, on the other hand, are less understood and have been rarely studied as having signaling potential. In an attempt to reduce this gap in knowledge, I investigated the potential signaling function of specific plumage characteristics in female <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> (Tachycineta bicolor). <b>Tree</b> <b>swallows</b> are one of only two species of North American passerines where females, rather than males, have delayed plumage maturation (DPM). Females in their second year of life (SY) display mainly brown subadult-coloured' feathers on their dorsal surface, while older (after-second year of life: ASY) females primarily have iridescent blue-green adult-coloured' feathers. There is, however, much variation in the number of adult-coloured feathers in the dorsal plumage of SY females. To date, only one study has experimentally examined the potential signaling function of DPM in female <b>tree</b> <b>swallows,</b> and no study has yet examined variation in the amount of DPM exhibited among SY females. Although plumage colour of ASY female <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> is less variable compared to SY females, such variation in ASY females is related to reproductive success, making both SY and ASY female plumage characteristics potentially indicative of quality. In this thesis, I investigated 1) if conspecifics behave differently towards SY and ASY females based solely on plumage colouration, indicating that DPM could signal subordinate status and inexperience during the breeding season, 2) if variability in the amount of DPM in SY female <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> is a condition-dependent trait and therefore possibly a target of sexual selection, and 3) whether variation in plumage traits of ASY female <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> isThe original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>swallows</b> (Tachycineta bicolor) {{located in}} southeastern Louisiana {{are known to}} form nocturnal {{communal}} roosts and {{have been shown to}} exhibit high roost fidelity, with individuals often returning to the same roost they had occupied on the previous night.

40|$|Territorial {{aggression}} influences fitness and, in monogamous pairs, {{the behavior}} of both individuals could impact reproductive success. Moreover, territorial aggression is particularly important {{in the context of}} interspecific competition. <b>Tree</b> <b>swallows</b> and eastern bluebirds are highly aggressive, secondary cavity-nesting birds that compete for limited nesting sites. We studied eastern bluebirds at a field site in the southern Appalachian Mountains that has been recently colonized (, 40 yr) by <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> undergoing a natural range expansion. The field site is composed of distinct areas where bluebirds compete regularly with <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> and areas where there is little interaction between the two species. Once birds had settled, we measured how interspecific competition affects the relationship between assortative mating (paired individuals that behave similarly) and reproductive success in eastern bluebirds. We found a strong tendency toward assortative mating throughout the field site. In areas of high interspecific competition, pairs that behaved the most similarly and displayed either extremely aggressive or extremely non-aggressive phenotypes experienced higher reproductive success. Our data suggest that interspecific competition with <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> may select for bluebirds that express similar behavior to that of their mate. Furthermore, animal personality may be an important factor influencing the outcome of interactions between native and aggressive, invasive species...|$|R
500|$|The three Delichon {{species are}} members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae {{subfamily}} which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins.

The genetic evidence suggests a close relationship between Hirundo and Delichon, which is further supported by the frequency of interbreeding between two widespread species, the barn swallow and the common house martin, despite being their being in different genera. The suggested taxonomic sequence of the mud-building swallows has been recommended by at least two European taxonomic committees.|$|E

40|$|We {{manipulated}} brood {{sizes of}} <b>Tree</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Tachycineta bicolor) in 1996 and 1997 {{to test for}} the existence of intra- and intergenerational costs of reproduction. Modal clutch size was six eggs, but experimental brood sizes ranged from two to nine young. Nestling starvation was higher in 1996 (and dependent on brood size) than in 1997, but in both years enlargement of brood size resulted in increased productivity. Nestling mass near fledging was negatively correlated with brood size, but tarsus length and wing chord were not. Food deliveries by parents increased steadily between broods of two to six young but then remained constant between broods of six to nine young. The loss of female mass between incubation {{and the end of the}} nestling period was positively related to the pair 2 ̆ 7 s total feeding effort, and female mass near fledging declined with increasing brood size. The latter decline disappeared, however, when broods of nine were omitted. Adult return rate (1996 to 1997) was highest among birds that raised enlarged broods. Our results, and a review of other studies of <b>Tree</b> <b>Swallows,</b> suggest that broods of seven or eight young can be raised without costs to the parents or young, and it appears that costs associated with feeding young have not influenced annual fecundity of <b>Tree</b> <b>Swallows.</b> Rather, egg production is most likely limited by energy availability to laying females. A major cost of reproduction for <b>Tree</b> <b>Swallows</b> probably arises from nest-site competition in that early arrival in spring to obtain nest sites exposes adults to high risks of death from starvation...|$|R

40|$|Most current {{knowledge}} {{of the effects of}} age on immune function comes from studies in humans, laboratory models, and domesticated animals. This dissertation explored variation in immune function in relation to age in free-living animals by investigating patterns, mechanisms and their implications in <b>tree</b> <b>swallows,</b> a widespread passerine species in North America. The first study investigated the ontogeny of immune defense in <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> and found some support for the prediction that innate immune defenses should reach adult levels earlier than adaptive defenses, but limited support for the prediction that adaptive defenses would be more related to body condition than innate defenses. Overall, immune function of the young is poorly developed compared to that of adults, as is the case for humans and laboratory or domesticated animals. The second study focused on the opposite extreme of the lifespan investigating the aging of the immune system in <b>tree</b> <b>swallows.</b> This study shows that not all components of immune function are equally affected by age and provides the most thorough description of immunosenescence patterns and mechanisms in a free-living vertebrate population to date. Overall, aspects of T-cell function seem to be the most affected by age in <b>tree</b> <b>swallows,</b> as is known for humans and laboratory animals. Having documented the pattern of immunosenescence, the third study investigated the consequences of immunosenescence in free-living <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> through a field experiment simulating a bacterial infection (challenge with lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in females of different ages during the nestling rearing period. This study provided support for the hypothesis that older, immunosenescent individuals pay higher costs than younger ones when faced with a challenge to their immune system and that these costs are mediated by an exaggerated sickness behavior, as seen in laboratory rodents. These results provided the first evidence of costs of immunosenescence in free-living animals. Finally, the fourth study investigated the relationships among six measures of immune defense commonly used in ecoimmunology studies that were assessed simultaneously in individual free-living <b>tree</b> <b>swallows.</b> This study identified three main axes of variation in immune function among individuals, representing variation in T-cell function, B-cell function, and innate immune function. A trade-off within the acquired arm of the immune system was apparent only when controlling for variation in body condition, age, and general quality among individuals. This study also highlighted that classification of some immune components as innate or acquired is ambiguous and as such can lead to ambiguous interpretation of results, if this is not acknowledged. Overall, this dissertation provides the most thorough description of ontogeny and senescence patterns of immune function in any free-living animal to date and shows that age is an important factor influencing immune responses in the wild...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether levels of metals and metalloid elements in dietary items and tissues of nestling <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> inhabiting areas near oilsands mine operations were higher compared to those of reference sites. We hypothesized that if there was increased, industry-related exposure to metals, it would be via the diet. We identified the invertebrate prey in the stomach contents of nestlings. We also collected invertebrates using Malaise traps near nest boxes, and analyzed those taxa found in the nestling diet to understand potential variability in metal exposure. For most elements, we found no significant differences in concentrations in the liver, kidney, or stomach contents between sites near to and far from oilsands operations. Concentrations of five elements were positively correlated among tissues and stomach contents. For invertebrates collected from Malaise traps, location differences occurred in some absolute elemental concentrations, which were most often highest at reference sites away from mining operations. We found no evidence that nestling <b>tree</b> <b>swallows</b> accumulated metals approaching toxic levels. <b>Tree</b> <b>swallows</b> consumed relatively high quantities of terrestrial insects, possibly limiting exposure to water borne, food-web-related contaminants.
