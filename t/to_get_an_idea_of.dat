[...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

But hopefully people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting the other day that the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E
500|$|London generates about 20 {{per cent}} of the UK's GDP (or $600billion in 2014); while {{the economy of the}} London {{metropolitan}} area—the largest in Europe—generates about 30 per {{cent of the}} UK's GDP (or an estimated $669billion in 2005). London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. London is the world's most expensive office market {{for the last three years}} according to world property journal (2015) report. [...] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion – same value as that of Brazil annual GDP. The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics. On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188 and Paris €11,229.|$|E

500|$|Part of this {{creative}} experimentation was a trial-and-error approach. Liszt constructed compositions {{with varying}} sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends. He sketched sections, sometimes without fully completing them, {{on a small}} number of staves with some indication of the orchestration. After an assistantAugust Conradi from 1848 to 1849, Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853had realized Liszt's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard, Liszt would then make further revisions; he moved sections to form different structural relationships, and modified connective materials or composed them anew, completing the piece of music. The score was copied, then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience. Many years later, Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works: [...] "I needed to hear them in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> them." [...] He added that it was much more for this reason, and not simply for securing a public for his own works, that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere. After many such stages of composition, rehearsal and revision, Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied. However, it was his habit to write modifications to already printed scores. From his perspective, his compositions remained [...] "works in progress" [...] as he continued to reshape, rework, or add and subtract material. In some instances, a composition could exist in four or five versions simultaneously.|$|E

[...] He added:"In painting a picture an artist does not paint a real house, reproducing every minute detail. That sort of thing belongs to the old and now despised photographic school of art. [...] He paints in something to give tone to the figures. The great secret of art, as Whistler said, is knowing what to leave out. Every once [...] you get a shock by discovering a picture in which the director has shown signs of an artistic conscience. But the majority of moving pictures are still far behind commercial photography, which is becoming less and less photographic while most of the advertisements in the back pages of our magazines are more artistic than the average movie." ...|$|E
