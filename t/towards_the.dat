5|$|Hurricane Norbert {{marked the}} first time a core of a {{hurricane}} was fully mapped in three-dimensions. First forming on September 14, 1984 west of the Mexican coast, Norbert gradually intensified, reaching hurricane intensity two days after formation. On September 22, Norbert peaked in strength as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. While intensifying, Norbert meandered. It moved east, then north, then west, then south, then back <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> east, and finally <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> northeast. After fluctuating in intensity for two more days, Norbert rapidly weakened. It turned <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> northwest and made landfall in southern Baja California Norte as a tropical storm. The combination of Norbert and several other storms left thousands homeless throughout Mexico. The remnants of Hurricane Norbert produced moderate rain over Arizona.|$|E
