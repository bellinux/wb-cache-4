5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> the belief that reason {{should be used to}} determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|Banished is a city-building {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed by Shining Rock Software. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 18, 2014. The game focuses on careful resource management and survival as an isolated and growing society.

Banished received mixed reviews on release, with reviewers praising graphics and difficulty early in the game, but criticizing a lack of feedback for player actions and lower emphasis on survival as the city grows.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans. He bases this <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> a new reading of several Latin-language coin inscriptions as Monita despoti Ioanni instead of Monita despoti Oliveri, as previously thought. The new reading, which would identify the coins as being minted by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist Nedeljković, who rejects the initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver.|$|E

The basis of logic self-contraction of the <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> current calculus was shown. Mistakes and defects in the structure and meaning of the <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> current calculus were exposed. A new quantity-figure model as the premise of mathematics has been formed after the correction of definition of the real number and the point. Basic concepts such as the derivative, the differential, the primitive function and the integral have been redefined and the <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> calculus have been reestablished. By historical verification of <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> calculus, it is demonstrated that the Newton-Leibniz <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> calculus have returned {{in the form of the}} novel theories established in this paper.

50|$|A subtle {{point is}} that the functor from the stable {{homotopy}} category (the homotopy category of spectra) to generalized homology <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> CW-pairs is not an equivalence, although it gives a bijection on isomorphism classes; there are nonzero maps in the stable homotopy category (called phantom maps) that induce the zero map between homology <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> CW-pairs. Likewise, the functor from the stable homotopy category to generalized cohomology <b>theories</b> <b>on</b> CW-pairs is not an equivalence. It is the stable homotopy category, not these other categories, that has good properties such as being triangulated.|$|R

5|$|Although most extinct parrot {{species of}} the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared common {{features}} such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> morphological features {{and the fact that}} Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Other members of the Psittacula genus from the Mascarenes include the extant echo parakeet (Psittacula eques echo) of Mauritius, as well as the extinct Réunion parakeet (Psittacula eques eques), and Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul) of Rodrigues. A 2015 genetic study by Jackson et al. found the other Mascarene Psittacula taxa to group within a clade of rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri) subspecies from Asia and Africa.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} Polish Jewish family, Ulam studied {{mathematics}} at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute, where {{he earned his}} PhD in 1933 {{under the supervision of}} Kazimierz Kuratowski. In 1935, John von Neumann, whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked to establish important results regarding ergodic <b>theory.</b> <b>On</b> 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States a for the last time with his 17-year-old brother Adam Ulam. He became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1940, and a United States citizen in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Keynes {{contended that}} {{economic}} output is {{positively correlated with}} money velocity. He explained the relationship via changing liquidity preferences: people increase their money holdings during times of economic difficulty by reducing their spending, which further slows the economy. This paradox of thrift claimed that individual attempts to survive a downturn only worsen it. When the demand for money increases, money velocity slows. A slowdown in economic activities means markets might not clear, leaving excess goods to waste and capacity to idle. Turning the quantity <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> its head, Keynes argued that market changes shift quantities rather than prices. Keynes replaced the assumption of stable velocity with one of a fixed price-level. If spending falls and prices do not, the surplus of goods reduces the need for workers and increases unemployment.|$|E

5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective quantum field theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E

Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a non-perturbative formulation of string theory {{was one of the}} original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories which are equivalent to string <b>theory</b> <b>on</b> anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a definition of string theory in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.|$|E
