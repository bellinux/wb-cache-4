5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E
5|$|Like so much else, {{this is hard}} to say, but {{the balance}} of historians' judgements is that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been bishops based in Llanbadarn for a period, or even periods, in Celtic times. Church {{organisation}} in early medieval (pre-1100) Wales was flexible, {{and there were no}} fixed dioceses. The claim in Padarn's Life that he was bishop of Ceredigion reflects a tradition, but the actual area of the saint's influence was in north Ceredigion and what is now Radnorshire (mid-Powys). Ceredigion south of the river Wyre was David country. Some time after this the church is said to have lost its episcopal privileges. The church is thought to have been annexed, after the dissolution of the see, to that of St David's; although as with much of the early history this is uncertain. Bishops at this time were, in Wales, rather more itinerant than they later became, and diocesan boundaries much more fluid than they were later. Gerald of Wales (Gerald de Barri, better known as Giraldus Cambrensis), reported that he had been told that the bishopric had been lost because at some time past Llanbadarn's bishop had been murdered and the church lands appropriated by his killers, the forerunners of the clas which held the church {{at the time of his}} visit in 1188.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Hambledon Club is lost {{and there is no}} {{definite}} knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756 when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against Dartford, which had been a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. It is not known when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been a patron involved.|$|E
25|$|The gallows {{stood on}} the site of St. Mark's Church not far from Oval tube station.

500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one can only say that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.|$|E
50|$|LPG may be {{used for}} a {{supplemental}} fuel for diesels of all sizes. Diesel contains 128,700 BTU per US gallon, where propane contains 91,690 BTU per US gallon. If LPG is 30-40% less expensive, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> very <b>well</b> be a saving. Any actual savings are dependent on the relative cost of diesel versus LPG. In Australia, where diesel costs substantially more than LPG, savings of 10 to 20% are claimed.|$|R

2500|$|Bronzino {{developed}} {{a style of}} coldly distant magnificence, based on the Mannerist portraits of Pontormo, working almost entirely for Cosimo I, the first Medici Grand-Duke. [...] Bronzino's works, including his striking portraits of Cosimo's Duchess, Eleanor of Toledo were distributed in many versions across Europe, continuing {{to be made for}} two decades from the same studio pattern; a new portrait painted in her last years, about 1560, exists in only a few repetitions.

2500|$|An October 2001 {{report from}} provincial auditor Jon Singleton {{found that the}} Morris-Macdonald board had offered courses of dubious quality, and had overbilled the {{province}} {{by as much as}} four million dollars by claiming students who were not actually enrolled. [...] Caldwell dissolved the board the following month, and authorized the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to launch a criminal investigation. [...] The RCMP later found that there was insufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges. [...] Caldwell said of the matter, [...] "The absolute abrogation of responsibility that took place among these officials is appalling.

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{basis for}} King Arthur {{is a source}} of considerable debate among historians.

Historian David Dumville summed up his position: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The {{fact of the matter is}} that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E

The study examined the outcomes of the 10,000 lower-income people eligible for Medicaid who were chosen by this randomized system, which helped eliminate potential bias in the data produced.

2500|$|The first {{publication}} listing all baronetcies ever created was C. J. Parry's Index of Baronetcy Creations (1967). This listed them in alphabetical order, {{other than the}} last five creations (Dodds of West Chillington, Redmayne of Rushcliffe, Pearson of Gressingham, Finlay of Epping and Thatcher of Scotney). It showed the total number created from 1611 to 1964 to have been 3,482. They include five of Oliver Cromwell, several of which were recreated by Charles II. Twenty-five were created between 1688 and 1784 by James II in exile after his dethronement, by his son James Stuart ("The Old Pretender") and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart ("Bonny Prince Charlie"). These [...] "Jacobite baronetcies" [...] were never accepted by the English Crown, have all disappeared and should properly be excluded from the 3,482, making the effective number of creations 3,457.

2500|$|Even {{though he}} was rarely an experimenter, Poincaré recognizes and defends the {{importance}} of experimentation, which must remain a pillar of the scientific method. According to him, {{it is not necessary}} that mathematics incorporate physics into itself, but must develop as an asset unto itself. This asset would be above all a tool: in the words of Poincaré, mathematics is [...] "the only language in which [...] could speak" [...] to understand each other and to make themselves heard. This language of numbers seems elsewhere to reveal a unity hidden in the natural world, when <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>well</b> be only one part of mathematics that applies to theoretical physics. The primary objective of mathematical physics is not invention or discovery, but reformulation. It is an activity of synthesis, which permits one to assure the coherence of theories current at a given time.
