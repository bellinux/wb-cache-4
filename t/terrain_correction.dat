40|$|Abstract. Analytical, {{numerical}} and combina-tion {{methods are}} today {{available for the}} com-putation of the gravitational eect due to the known mass distribution dened by a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) at an arbitrary point in space. The numerical and combination methods are preferable {{in the case of}} more than one com-putation points and/or gravity stations, mainly when the goal is the computation of the topo-graphic eect at all points of a regular grid. The latter may coincide with the outer boundary of the topographic masses as described by the sur-face relief or may be located at a given ight height above the terrain. The main objective of the present paper is to compare dierent meth-ods for the computation of <b>terrain</b> <b>corrections</b> for a raster of target points.

40|$|The {{computer}} {{calculation of}} gravity terrain corrections from digital elevation models (DEMs) {{is a relatively}} routine task. The conventional approach has been to calculate the gravitational attraction at an observed location by summing the contribution from all DEM nodes. However, even with current high-powered computers, this task can be very time consuming, {{to the point where}} very accurate corrections are often not practical. To address this problem, currently available <b>terrain</b> <b>correction</b> algorithms use some sort of optimization strategy at the cost of accuracy. This paper discusses an optimization method that provides a maximum of accuracy and performance for even very large data sets. The approach combines gravity <b>terrain</b> <b>correction</b> methods described by Kane (1962), Nagy (1966), with new grid-mesh interpolation, zoning and de-sampling techniques. Test results from an area of the Rio Tinto valley in Spain are used to illustrate accuracy and performance against a standard <b>terrain</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm from Geosoft. <b>Terrain</b> <b>Correction</b> Algorithm The <b>terrain</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm described here can be run as either a one-step or two-step process. The choice of process depends on the accuracy required, data volume and operational efficiency (specifically, the need to add more stations and dynamically calculate terrain corrections as a survey progresses). Generally, the one-step process can be used to generate highly accurate results with high performance whereas the two-step process two-step process is optimized for large regional gravity surveys (for example, 100, 000 or more stations) or ongoing surveys. With the one-step process, the algorithm generates the terrain (regional plus local) corrections based on a usersupplied correction distance. With the two-step method (default), the process consists of calculating a one-time regional correction grid, and then calculating local corrections at each station with the same local correction distance and summing the regional and local correction at each station to obtain a total correction. Because the regional correction grid is only calculated once, this method is designed to save significant computational time for large data sets or surveys in which stations are being added dynamically...|$|E

These algoriithms utilize fast Fourier transforms, but, in contrast to methods currently in use, all divergences of the integrals are removed during the analysis. Sequential methods employing a smooth intermediate reference surface were developed to avoid the very large transforms necessary when making computations at high resolution over a wide area. A new method for the numerical solution of Molodensky's problem was developed to mitigate the convergence difficulties that occur at short wavelengths with methods based on a Taylor series expansion. A trial field on a level surface is continued analytically to the topographic surface, and compared with that predicted from gravity observations. The difference is used to compute a correction to the trial field and the process iterated. Special techniques are employed to speed convergence and prevent oscillations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rice is an {{important}} crop in Taiwan because it provides not only livelihoods but also employment {{for a majority of}} rural populations. The size of rice fields in Taiwan is small and fragmented. The optical satellite data, such as Landsat and MODIS data, are easily contaminated by cloud cover that potentially affect the mapping results. The microwave data, which are able to penetrate though cloud cover, can partly overcome such issues of optical data. This study aims to map rice fields using RADARSTA- 2 data for Changhua County in the middle of Taiwan. The data were processed for the 2014 first rice cropping season through four main steps: (1) data pre-processing, including radiometric and <b>terrain</b> <b>corrections</b> and speckle noise filtering of the backscattering coefficient of cross-polarization (VH) data, (2) Normalized Difference Sigma- 0 Index (NDSI) calculation using 2 SAR images of sowing and heading dates selected based cropping calendar, (3) image classification using a threshold of NDSI, and (4) accuracy assessment of the mapping results.

Here, this technique is used to study the deep underground structure of the Lanzarote (Canary Islands). For this purpose, a network of 296 gravity stations distributed over the whole island and a digital terrain model of about 45, 000 terrestrial and oceanic data (to determine the corresponding <b>terrain</b> <b>corrections),</b> are used.

The main quantity of masses (corresponding probably to the main intrusive body) is concentrated under the central area and can correspond to a dilated volcanic activity (of shield formation). The center of this body is located at a depth of about 8 - 10 km.

Several data sources are included for the computations; these include 7447 terrestrial free-air gravity anomalies, 10243 altimeter derived gravity anomalies and 692881 mean digital elevation heights. The EGM 96 global geopotential model to degree 40 is used in order to determine the long wavelength effect of the Co-geoid surface. Co-geoid undulations are determined through implementation of the remove-restore technique by combining the above-mentioned data sets with the geopotential model in a specific manner.

Although marine gravity measurements {{have been made in}} the forearc basin and elsewhere on a number of research cruises (e. g.

The onshore and satellite-derived offshore data were matched at coastlines without undue difficulty, as should be the case because both free-air and Bouguer corrections are zero at sea level. However, gradients tend to be steep at the coasts in the forearc region, partly because of the change from free-air gravity, which is strongly correlated with local bathymetry, to Bouguer gravity, which is corrected for local topography.
