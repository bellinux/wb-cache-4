5|$|In 1948, the ACLU {{prevailed in}} the McCollum v. Board of Education case, which {{challenged}} public school religious classes <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> clergy paid for from private funds. The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so.

However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas <b>taught</b> <b>by</b> Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.|$|E
