5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Andean</b> condor is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. <b>The</b> <b>Andean</b> condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Andean</b> condor is {{the only}} {{accepted}} living species of its genus, Vultur. Unlike the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of , the fossil record of <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> condor recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, {{may have been a}} smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.|$|E
50|$|The {{name comes}} from <b>the</b> <b>Andeans</b> {{contemporary}} to <b>the</b> Conquista, who believed that the wak'as were annoyed by the expansion of Christianity. <b>The</b> wak'as, <b>Andean</b> spirits, began taking possession of the Indigenous people, making them dance to music and announce divine will to restore the pre-Hispanic culture, mythology and politics.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground.

5|$|Activity of Cerro Blanco {{goes back}} 8 mya, when the Maricunga Belt {{in the west}} was active. The volcano is {{responsible}} for a large Holocene eruption with a Volcano explosivity index 7, the largest in <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years. It is comparable to Santorini and Tambora's large eruptions.|$|E
50|$|The {{patterns}} of genetic adaptation among <b>the</b> <b>Andeans</b> are largely distinct {{from those of}} the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, EGLN1 appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and <b>Andeans.</b> Even then, <b>the</b> pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Among <b>the</b> <b>Andeans,</b> there are no significant associations between EPAS1 or EGLN1 SNP genotypes and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans. The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.|$|R

5|$|Nearly 100 Quaternary (Pleistocene- or Holocene-age) {{independent}} volcanoes {{exist in}} the country, in addition to 60volcanic complexes and caldera systems. Of the 200 historically active volcanoes in <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> Range, 36 are found in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz {{lies within}} the Pacific Ring of Fire, {{a region that}} encircles the Pacific Ocean and {{contains}} some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. <b>The</b> <b>Andean</b> Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As {{is the case for}} many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).|$|E

5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E

5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{bears are}} found in sixty {{countries}} primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe.

The Atlas bear, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California.

The experiment was a success, and all <b>the</b> <b>Andean</b> condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|E
