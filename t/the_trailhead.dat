5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailhead</b> at Marlay Park {{is served}} {{by a number of}} Dublin Bus routes. There is no public {{transport}} available to or from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> in Clonegal, with the closest bus routes serving the nearby villages of Kildavin and Bunclody, County Carlow. Some places on or near the route are also served by bus. The St. Kevins (sic) Bus Service stops at Roundwood, Laragh and Glendalough. The Wicklow Way Bus provides services to Laragh, Glendalough, Glenmalure, Iron Bridge and Tinahely.|$|E
5|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> {{at lower}} elevations, alder {{thickets}} are present, {{as well as}} incense cedar, red firs, and western white pine. At higher elevations, groups of mountain hemlock and lupines prevail. Eagles and hawks can be frequently noted on high crags, and squirrels and pika live about the mountain.|$|E
5|$|The {{route to}} Gerlachovský štít {{falls under the}} Tatra National Park ordinance, {{according}} to which hikers who depart from marked trails {{may be subject to}} fines unless they are UIAA members, or are led by an IFMGA-certified mountain guide. Camping is subject to similar restrictions. Rangers and some mountain guides are authorized to collect fines on the spot. Cairns that hikers build to mark <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> are periodically taken apart.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} two <b>trailheads.</b> <b>The</b> older <b>trailhead</b> is on 224th Ave NE. <b>The</b> newer <b>trailhead</b> {{is located at}} 3650 Sahalee Way NE.|$|R

5|$|The Wicklow Way forms part of European walking route E8 {{which runs}} from Dursey Island in County Cork to Istanbul in Turkey. The Irish section {{incorporates}} the Wicklow Way, the South Leinster Way, the East Munster Way, the Blackwater Way {{and parts of}} the Kerry Way and the Beara Way. There is an unmarked link route from Dublin Port (where the E8 connects to Liverpool by ferry) which follows the River Dodder to Rathfarnham and on to the Wicklow Way trailhead at Marlay Park via Saint Enda's Park. Similarly, an unmarked road walk connects Clonegal with <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> of the South Leinster Way in Kildavin, County Carlow.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. <b>The</b> <b>trailhead</b> comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending from a broad ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailhead</b> {{for most}} of the hiking trails is located near the {{campground}} along Crooked Run.|$|E
50|$|There are 37 mi {{of trails}} with eight <b>trailheads.</b> <b>The</b> most used is <b>the</b> Granite Chief <b>trailhead</b> located at Squaw Valley Ski Area parking lot. Talbot {{campground}} is located near <b>the</b> Talbot <b>trailhead,</b> four miles (6 km) north of French Meadows Reservoir and is <b>the</b> only <b>trailhead</b> with a no-fee campground.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} marked trails throughout the refuge. Most of these trails have very limited parking if any immediately by <b>the</b> <b>trailheads.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> are at Onepoto, and Hopuruahine, on the {{southern}} and northern edges of the lake respectively. Most people take 3 to 4 days to complete the trail.|$|R
25|$|Steep {{unofficial}} descent trails back to <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> can {{be found}} on both the north and south ends of the cliff, above Whitney-Gilman and Lakeside, respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailhead</b> {{begins at}} 43.3123337N, 74.2559280W. It passes over Pete's creek by bridge, and runs beside Silver lake. It {{contains}} a few camp sites and old foundations along the path.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailhead</b> of the Dublin Mountains Way {{a long-distance}} walking route across the Dublin {{side of the}} Wicklow Mountains between Tallaght and Shankill begins at Sean Walsh Park near Tallaght Stadium.|$|E
50|$|Gawthorpe {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>trailheads</b> of <b>the</b> Brontë Way, a 43 mi long-distance {{footpath}} {{that crosses}} the South Pennines to Haworth, continuing to Oakwell Hall, Birstall, West Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> are at Cerbère, and Argelès, on the {{southern}} and northern edges of the Vermilion coast respectively. Most people take 1 to 2 days to complete the trails.|$|R
5000|$|The trail can be {{walked in}} either {{direction}} linking <b>the</b> <b>trailheads</b> of Helmsley (...) and Filey (...) in a horseshoe configuration. The trail is waymarked along its length using the standard National Trail acorn symbol.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} renovations, DEC {{installed}} a pit privy in the nearby woods. Later that decade it improved the Spruceton Trail to better allow the equestrian use it already permitted. It added a hitching rack, drinking barrel and mounting chute at the summit near the tower, corresponding with similar facilities elsewhere along the trail and at <b>the</b> <b>trailhead.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beyond it {{the path}} {{becomes even more}} obvious as the {{surrounding}} forest becomes totally boreal, with spruce and fir in every direction. Some gentle ascents alternate with level stretches before a last ascent into the small, viewless summit clearing. Distance is roughly 5miles (8km) from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead,</b> with a vertical gain of 1,455feet (443m).|$|E
25|$|Beyond Pine Plains, {{the forest}} returns {{to a more}} {{deciduous}} character as the trail remains level while becoming decidedly westward in heading, crossing many rivulets or streambeds, some offering picturesque mini-cascades of their own. Finally, at a junction 3.7miles (6km) from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead,</b> the Long Path drops down into Kaaterskill Clove while the snowmobile route heads up a slightly steeper slope. After several hundred feet (about a hundred meters), it reaches the loop.|$|E
50|$|Brigus Head Path is a 6.5 km hike of {{moderate}} difficulty. It takes 2-4 hours (one way) to complete. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> {{are located in}} Brigus South and Admirals Cove. Features Hares Ears rock formation at Hares Ears Point.|$|R
50|$|Biscan Cove Path is a 7.3 km hike of {{moderate}} difficultly. It takes about 2-4 hours (one way) to complete. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> {{are located in}} Cape St. Francis and Pouch Cove. The hike can be challenging but offers views offshore.|$|R
50|$|Bonny Lakes can be {{accessed}} by either <b>the</b> Wallowa Lake <b>Trailhead</b> (10 miles of travel) or <b>the</b> Tenderfoot <b>Trailhead</b> (3.5 miles of travel). The lakes lie on Trail 1802.|$|R
25|$|At {{the last}} fork, a mile (1.6km) from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> a state sign {{indicates}} the distances to Palenville, the next place the Long Path reaches civilization, and other {{points of interest}} {{on the far side}} of the mountain. From this point on the trail becomes narrower as it is barred to all other motor vehicles, and starts to curve to the northeast, into state land. A yellow-blazed spur, the former Nature Friends Trail, only recently added to the state system, leads to the scenic Huckleberry Point overlook after a while.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at mile 50.7 of the Skyline Drive {{near the}} Byrd Visitor Center, Dark Hollow Falls Trail leads {{downhill}} beside Hogcamp Branch to Dark Hollow Falls, a 70-foot cascade. The distance from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> {{to the base}} of the falls is 0.7 mile, although the trail continues beyond that point, crossing the creek and connecting with the Rose River fire road. Various fauna can be viewed along the trail, including occasional sightings of black bear and timber rattlesnake. While the trail is relatively short, parts of it are steep and may prove challenging to some visitors. There is no view from the brink of the falls, and slippery rocks make it inadvisable to leave the trail.|$|E
25|$|Starting from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> {{parking lot}} at the top of Platte Clove, {{recently}} expanded by NYSDEC, hikers follow the old Steenburg Road, now the snowmobile trail, blazed both with large orange plastic discs for snowmobiles (rarely seen) and smaller blue ones for foot users (A color given on all DEC lands to sections of the Long Path not part of other designated trails). The cascades of a nearby tributary of Platte Creek beckon through hemlock stands, but are on private land. Vehicle tracks can still be seen as there are several forks leading to private homes in the area, usually chained off. Elevation gain is noticeable, but comes at a slight though steady pace.|$|E
50|$|Bear Cove Path is a 11.6 km hike of {{moderate}} difficulty. It takes about 4-6 hours (one way) to complete. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> {{are located in}} Kingman's Cove and Renews. The path features two historic sites, a settlement and lighthouse, and seasonal berry grounds.|$|R
50|$|After 1990, {{the rail}} line passing through Pine Grove {{became part of}} a rail trail, the OC&E Woods Line State Trail, managed by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. One of <b>the</b> <b>trailheads</b> on <b>the</b> 100 mi trail is at Pine Grove.|$|R
50|$|Mudder Wet Path is a 2.9 km, easy hike. It takes 1-2 hours (one way) to complete. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> {{are located}} in South West River and Aquaforte. It is a {{peaceful}} walk through the woods with views of tidal estuaries and waterfalls.|$|R
25|$|Hikers {{coming from}} the south also {{have the option of}} taking the train to the trails {{from as far away as}} Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line {{parallels}} NY 9D and the east bank of the river, where request stops have been built at Breakneck Ridge and Manitou, south of Garrison along the river. The former is a short distance from <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> and parking lot; the latter is at river's edge, requiring a short climb up to the Manitoga and Canada Hill areas. Service to those stations is weekends-only, with northbound trains making stops in the mornings and southbound ones taking returning hikers in the evening. At other times hikers can use the Cold Spring station, with regularly scheduled trains.|$|E
25|$|Just {{east of the}} Stony Brook bridge, the Pine Meadow Trail {{begins on}} the {{southeast}} side of the highway. The road loosely parallels Stony Brook as it heads deeper into the park and serves the Reeves Meadow Visitor Center. The center is also a trailhead for the Reeves Brook Trail, with the Pine Meadow Trail passing the facility on its southeast side. Past the visitor center, the parallel alignments of Seven Lakes Drive and Johnsontown Road {{come to an end}} as the latter ends at a cul-de-sac adjacent to the former. The dead end serves as <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> for two hiking trails: the Blue Disc Trail, which starts just before the cul-de-sac; and the White Bar Trail, which begins at the cul-de-sac's northern end. Not far from this point, the Kakiat Trail crosses Seven Lakes Drive on its way toward Kakiat County Park.|$|E
25|$|The parkway {{continues}} to follow Lake Kanawauke to Kanawauke Circle, where it intersects with County Route106 (CR106), formerly part of NY210. Not {{far from the}} junction, Seven Lakes Drive passes two more lakes, Lake Skannatati {{to the west and}} Lake Askoti to the east, as it slowly curves to the north. The highway crosses the Long Path near Lake Skannatati and connects to a parking area near Lake Askoti. Another trail, the Red Cross Trail, traverses Seven Lakes Drive at the northern end of Lake Askoti. About a half-mile (0.8km) north of Lake Askoti is Lake Tiorati, located along {{the eastern edge of the}} road. As the highway runs past the lake, it turns back to the northeast and eventually reaches Tiorati Circle at the northern tip of the lake. The junction serves as the east end of Arden Valley Road, the west end of Tiorati Brook Road, and <b>the</b> <b>trailhead</b> of the Lake Tiorati Trail.|$|E
50|$|The 75 mi long Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge (SRK) Greenway, a hiking trail, {{traverses}} {{the summit}} and subsidiary knobs of <b>the</b> mountain. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> are at Proctor Academy on NH Route 11 in Andover and, {{on the northern}} side, on New Canada Road in Danbury.|$|R
50|$|Island Meadow Path is a 10.1 km hike of {{moderate}} difficulty. It takes 4-6 hours (one way) to complete. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> are located at Renews and Bear Cove. The trail {{is made up}} of primarily woodlands and headlands and features views of Renews Island.|$|R
50|$|Tinkers Point Path is a 5.1 km, easy hike. It takes 2-3 hours (one way) to complete. <b>The</b> <b>trailheads</b> {{are located}} in Mobile and Tors Cove. The path moves from woods to the beachside. Features beach access, picnicking, and {{seasonal}} bird and whale watching.|$|R
