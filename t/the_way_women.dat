25|$|Within the United States, social {{location}} affects <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>women</b> perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research {{indicates that}} whether a woman views menopause {{as a medical}} issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status. The paradigm within which a woman considers menopause influences the way she views it: Women who understand menopause as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who {{view it as a}} life transition or a symbol of aging.|$|E

25|$|In the Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2007, {{health systems}} in many {{countries}} were noted to {{have been unable to}} deliver adequately on gender equity in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women’s health needs can be very different. In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of gender equity in terms of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>women</b> are regarded - as both consumers (users) and producers (carers) of health care services. For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means of something else rather on the well-being of women. In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of fertility control rather than as care for women's well-being. Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence. This significantly reduces the ability and efficiency of female caregivers providing care to patients, particularly female ones.|$|E
500|$|Austen's {{works are}} noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free {{indirect}} speech, burlesque and irony. They critique {{the novels of}} sensibility {{of the second half}} of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen makes fun of [...] "such novelistic clichés as love at first sight, the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents". Austen's plots, though comic, highlight <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>women</b> of the gentry depended on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like the writings of Samuel Johnson, a strong influence on her, her works are fundamentally concerned with moral issues.|$|E
500|$|... "Many {{technological}} systems, when {{examined for}} context and overall design, are basically anti-people," [...] Franklin writes. [...] "People {{are seen as}} sources of problems while technology {{is seen as a}} source of solutions." [...] As a result, people live and work under conditions structured for the well-being of technology even though manufacturers and promoters always present new technologies as liberating. [...] "The dreams of flight, of fast private transportation, of instant communication across continents, and of helpful machines, all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home." [...] But once technologies are accepted and standardized, they often enslave or displace their users. Franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>women</b> traditionally work in running households for example, or in caring for children.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} recontextualize {{the understanding of}} <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>women</b> resist power structures through examining the Chipko Movement. This modern social movement started in the early 1970 s in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand, India. The historical context of this innovative activism is framed {{through the lens of}} post-colonial, Gandhi-style nonviolence. The backbone of the demonstration consisted of women concerned with the preservation of their livelihoods. The assertive actions of these low-caste women created an awakening within the women of India that continues to reverberate with women currently agitating for equal rights. Based upon the scholarship of Vandana Shiva and Shobhita Jain, this research aims to reframe the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>women</b> resisted power structures within recent history...|$|R

2500|$|The song [...] "With Twilight as My Guide" [...] {{appears to}} take place during the Salem Witch Trials, which is {{revealed}} through an interview with opera singer Renée Fleming, who covered the song on her album Dark Hope: [...] "I was especially fascinated by the Mars Volta song, 'With Twilight As My Guide', which is operatic in its scale and musical complexity. I was however a bit concerned about the text, specifically the reference to 'devil daughters'. I said, 'As much as I love this song, I really can't sing it for that reason.' Peter Mensch offered to contact Cedric Bixler-Zavala and asked if the text could be changed, since the overall meaning of the song wasn't completely clear anyway. Cedric responded, [...] "Sure, she can change it. I would just {{like it to be}} known that in no way is the lyric supposed to paint women in a bad light... The song feels like it was written during the Salem Witch Trials, and it sarcastically takes the religious right wing slang of how all women were treated. Our last album, Bedlam in Goliath, was one huge metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>women</b> are treated in Islamic society (honor killings, etc) not just a story about a ouija board... it's meant to make you question the way things are." ...|$|E

For a change, Nigerian women were strong, smart and beautiful. Although the women in this film are flawed, like every other human being, they were also shown to be inherently good and beautiful." [...] Dami Elebe commended the acting skills of the two lead actors in the film: [...] "Nse Ikpe-Etim executed her role in this movie with precision, perfect pronunciation and class. Wale Ojo is not the typical Nollywood leading man. He is not the hot young boy we always want to just stare at, but the mature fine man we also want to hear. He blended in his role perfectly and showed that he is not a one movie wonder but an actor who will last a lifetime in Nollywood". Caitlin Pearson commented on Wale Ojo's acting skills by stating: [...] "Ojo definitely impresses with his versatility as an actor in taking up this role, and manages to balance the austere qualities of Akin’s character with a sense of compassion". She also commended Hafiz Oyetoro's character [...] by stating [...] "the most funny and entertaining performance is by Hafiz Oyetoro who plays Akin’s assistant Alex.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} recontextualize {{the understanding of}} <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>women</b> resist sexual violence and agitate for change of socio-cultural and political practices in India. Modern Indian women’s social movements were revitalized in the 1970 s with the Mathura rape case in Maharastra. The historical context of this impactful activism is framed through analysis of four pivotal rape cases – Mathura, Bhanwari Devi, Imrana and “Nirbhaya,” otherwise known as the Delhi gang rape case. The assertive and innovative resistance of women includes such tactics as sit-down protests, marches, rallies, candle light vigils, street theatre, presentations, ad campaigns, freeze mobs, and social media. The assertive actions of Indian women continue to generate public awareness, spawn alterations of national laws, and advance the examination of patriarchal and hegemonic male centric social systems. Based upon the scholarship of Radha Kumar, Mangala Subramaniam, Debolina Dutta, Oishik Sircar, Himika Bhattacharya and Deepti Misri, this research aims to reframe the understanding of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>women</b> resisted sexual violence within recent history...|$|R
