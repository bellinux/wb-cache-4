5|$|In 1627, Johannes Kepler {{became the}} first person to predict a transit of Venus, by {{predicting}} the 1631 event. His methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that the transit would not be visible in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona.

5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{elected to}} run out the clock and bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the ball on a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At {{the end of the}} first half of play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E

He ordered the {{artillery}} battery to set up on the knoll, and the 1st Battalion to attack Baby 700 and Mortar Ridge from the North-East, while the 2nd Battalion would simultaneously circle around and attack Baby 700 from the West. The 3rd Battalion would for the moment be held in reserve. At 10:30 Kemal informed II Corps he was attacking.|$|E

Collier took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E

Another important aspect <b>to</b> be <b>observed</b> regarding <b>the</b> accelerometer signal was a slight difference in the signal from the accelerometer (H 13) with and without the PZT transducer, especially between 200  Hz and 350  Hz (c.f., Figure  6).|$|R

Their new course takes the ship close to that of E.C.S. Horizon, the cargo vessel where Ensign Mayweather grew up. He then requests permission for a further detour to re-join his family on Horizon as his father is ill and he hasn't been able to visit him in four years. Captain Archer readily agrees, but bad news arrives when Mayweather learns that his father died some six weeks earlier.|$|E

Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin {{is holding a}} horse sale later in the month.

5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>the</b> entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
