Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a <b>total</b> <b>gain</b> of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage. Texas also was hurt by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E

Taylor {{completed}} a 12-yard pass to Coale, then Evans ran 11 yards, advancing {{the ball to the}} 50-yard line. After a pass from Taylor fell incomplete, he completed his next two attempts for a <b>total</b> <b>gain</b> of 19yards and a first down. Virginia Tech then committed a five-yard false start penalty, pushing the Hokies back to the Cincinnati 26-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, however, Virginia Tech running back Josh Oglesby made good the penalty with a 13-yard run to the Cincinnati 23-yard line.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a quantitative analysis of gains from trade {{in a model}} with head-to-head competition using Chinese firm-level data from Economic Censuses in 1995 and 2004. We find {{a significant reduction in}} trade cost during this period, and <b>total</b> <b>gains</b> from such improved openness during this period is 9 : 4 %. The gains are decomposed into a Ricardian component and two pro-competitive ones. The pro-competitive effects account for 25 : 4 % of the <b>total</b> <b>gains.</b> Moreover, the <b>total</b> <b>gains</b> from trade are 17 - 27 % larger than what would result from the formula provided by ACR (Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare 2012), which nests a class of important trade models, but without pro-competitive effects. We find that head-to-head competition is the key reason behind the larger gains, as trade flows do not reflect all of the effects via markups in an event of trade liberalization. One methodological advantage of this paper’s quantitative framework is that its application is not constrained by industrial or product classifications; thus it can be applied to countries of any size...|$|R

500|$|While {{designing}} {{sound for}} the musical Hair, Dugan began {{to appreciate the}} human operator's inability to act quickly enough to control multiple microphones. He saw the show's audio mixing person [...] "working rotary knobs for 16 area mics, 9 hand mics, and 10 mics in the band". Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal, {{more than just the}} room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs), finally developing the [...] "Dugan Music System", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the <b>total</b> <b>gain</b> was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were [...] "continuously and automatically adjusted" [...] by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a [...] "Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems" [...] was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{studies on}} bank takeovers {{have not been}} able to {{distinguish}} among the three competing motives: synergy, agency, and hubris. This paper distinguishes the three competing motives by examining the relations between target <b>gains</b> and <b>total</b> <b>gains</b> and between acquirer gains and target gains. Empirical results show that bank takeovers are primarily motivated by synergy, although there is also strong evidence of hubris. Our results also suggest that hubris may explain the positive target gains and zero or negative acquirer gains found in this and many other bank takeover studies. Lastly, evidence exists to suggest that agency, along with hubris, may explain takeovers with negative <b>total</b> <b>gains</b> (JEL G 21, G 34). Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998. ...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{measures}} of elevation gain {{are important for}} monitoring energy expenditure and physical load. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the accuracy of barometric devices used for measuring elevation gain. Observational validation study. Twenty-eight barometric altimeter devices (SRM and Garmin) were used to measure <b>total</b> elevation <b>gain</b> during cycling over three different climbs (length range: 3. 2 - 18. 4 km), giving a total of 216 climbs. An online mapping tool ([URL] was used to calculate the criterion measure of <b>total</b> elevation <b>gain.</b> Data were categorised into two weather conditions: dry and wet. The standard errors of the estimate for <b>total</b> elevation <b>gain</b> measured by SRM and Garmin devices were 1. 5 % and 1. 9 %, respectively. In dry conditions, SRM devices underestimated the <b>total</b> elevation <b>gain</b> by an average of ~ 5 % while the Garmin devices underestimated it by ~ 2 %. In wet weather conditions the bias worsened to - 25 %. Measurements of <b>total</b> elevation <b>gain</b> recorded with devices of differed brands were similarly accurate in dry weather conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the contribution of a computer simulation to students’ learning of physics concepts (weight and mass). Our simulation was produced using the software Modellus. This study evaluates progresses in understanding made by students (grade 7; 12 - 13 years old) after one lesson (90 minutes) in three different scenarios: using only “hands-on” activities, using only a computer simulation, and using both. The progresses were measured through pre- and post-tests. The results show that the <b>total</b> <b>gains</b> were higher when students used the computer simulation, alone or together with “hands-on” activities. However, we found that the <b>total</b> <b>gains</b> obtained depend on the teachers pedagogy when using the computer simulation to teach the concepts of weight and mass...|$|R

This study was conducted at New Donnington Farm to evaluate the effects of dried poultry litter (26 % Crude Protein) as a substitute of cotton seed cake (31 % Crude Protein) on average daily <b>gain,</b> <b>total</b> weight <b>gain,</b> feed conversion ratio and costs of formulating rations of Brangus steers. Thirty steers aged 18 months weighing 300 Â± 5 kg were randomly allocated to 5 treatments, 24 steers were fed dried poultry litter based rations and 6 steers were fed the control ration for 90 days in a completely randomised design experiment which was replicated six times. Formulated rations were Isoenergetic (12. 50 MJ ME/ kg) and Isonitrogenous (16 % Crude Protein). The final average daily <b>gains,</b> <b>total</b> weight <b>gains</b> and feed conversion ratios were significantly different (p> 0. 05) for all treatments.

In 1976, Dugan was granted a patent for an automatic microphone mixing process whereby the <b>total</b> <b>gain</b> of the system remains constant. He began manufacturing his first automixer system, the Model A, based on his two patents. Dugan built 60 units, with the first, hand-assembled one taken to Bell Labs to be installed in their conference room for Harvey Fletcher. The algorithm was simple and effective: Each individual input channel is attenuated by an amount, in dB, equal to the difference, in dB, between that channel’s level and {{the sum of all}} channel levels. Dugan licensed the system to Altec who released several automixer models including the 1674A, -B and -C series and the 1684A, all focusing on speech applications. (The 1684A became an Electrovoice product and is currently administered by their Commercial division.) The earliest Altec product implementation was regarded as inferior within the commercial audio contractor industry, and other manufacturers began to design their own automixer products.|$|E
