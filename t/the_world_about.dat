They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>about</b> Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
