40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the contamination index of metals and pesticides in pregnant women, and to relate this to perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Descriptive, retrospective, exploratory study, developed from existing secondary data analyses at Level III maternity center. A total of 40 mothers with their newborns (NB), {{living in a}} rural area in Botucatu- Brazil and surrounding region. Blood samples from mothers and newborn were collected to determine the <b>total</b> <b>contamination</b> index for metals and pesticides. The concentrations of each metal and each pesticide were determined in blood samples of mothers and their newborns by Rudge's results. After obtaining these concentrations, the <b>total</b> <b>contamination</b> index in mother and NB was calculated, along with its correlation with clinical parameters of NB. RESULTS: There was no correlation (p> 0. 05) between maternal contamination index with NB clinical parameters, and NB contamination index versus NB clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: The maternal contamination index of metals and pesticides was not related to perinatal outcomes, but it could be used as baseline parameter in future toxicological studies, regarding to long-term toxic characteristics as persistent organic pollutants, its long half-lives, bioacumulative, and expected to impose serious health effects on humans.

The mean concentrations of PFCs in whole blood were 20 to 50 {{times higher than the}} total concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB] and p, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene. Similarly, the PFC concentrations were 300 to 450 times greater than for hexachlorbenzene and the sum of the six chlordanes and the three polybrominated diphenyl ethers. However, the PFCs and the POP that were measured behaved differently in regard to their distribution in the body, making an additional comparison of <b>total</b> body <b>contamination</b> necessary. PFCs are mainly found in the blood and the liver, whereas polychlorinated and polybrominated POPs are chiefly present in the fat tissue and blood lipids. The reason for these differences appears {{to be related to the}} different basic structures and the binding behavior in blood of these substances [40, 79, 80]. Whole blood contains about 0.5 % blood lipids, and thus represents only a small part of the <b>total</b> body <b>contamination</b> of PCB for example.

The 3 -D, transient model is based on energy and biomass conservation complemented by primary and secondary predictive notations, allowing one to virtualize the combined effect of bacterial growth and migration, under any possible handling and storage conditions.
