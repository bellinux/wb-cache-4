Many of these applications require common video representations {{that should be}} oriented towards how people describe video content.

We then introduce a computational framework for high-level video representation that evolves towards how people describe video content. Our framework represents a video shot {{in terms of its}} moving objects and <b>their</b> related <b>semantic</b> <b>features</b> such as events and other high-level motion features. To achieve higher applicability, content should be extracted independently of the type and the context of the input video. Our representation system, implemented on 6371 images with multi-object occlusion and artifacts, produces stable results in real-time. This is due to the adaptation to noise, the compensation of estimation errors at the various processing levels, and the division of the processing system into simple but effective tasks. 1.

40|$|M. A. (African Languages) The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} morphological reduplication in the word class nouns, verbs and ideophones in Zulu, and to describe them according to <b>their</b> formal and <b>semantic</b> <b>features.</b> An outline is given in chapter 1 of the status of the morpheme within the word morphology according to general linguistic principles, theories concerning the morpheme as well as the character or nature of morphological reduplication. According to the literature on this subject it appears that morphological reduplication performs widely, even universally. In chapter 2 attention is given to reduplication in the most important languages and dialects in the Nguni language group apart from Zulu. These languages and dialects include the following: Swati, Bhaca, Phuthi, Northen Transvaal Ndebele, Lala, Xhosa, Southern Transvaal Ndebele and Mpondo. It is found that all these languages and dialects present a common character with regard to morphological reduplication. Zulu, as the main concern of study in respect of morphological reduplication, is studied in detail in chapter 3. The word classes of Zulu are looked at according to Van Wyk's word class grouping, whilst special attention is given to nouns. It is found that morphological reduplication in Zulu nouns shows an extention of the <b>semantic</b> <b>features</b> represented in the single noun. The reduplicated forms have the <b>semantic</b> <b>features</b> of especially abundance, numerousness and completeness. The formal features of the reduplicated noun in Zulu are studied with special reference to the monosyllabic noun, the disyllabic noun and the polisyllabic noun. Their possible combination (in their reduplicated form) with a suffix as well as the formal features of the reduplicated suffix, are studied at length. In chapter 4 the morphological reduplication of verbs (in this instance also monosyllabic, disyllabic and polisyllabic stems) is discussed. The verb can be reduplicated as a whole or only partially with the <b>semantic</b> <b>features</b> of, inter alia, intensity or thoroughness. The verb can also be reduplicated in combination with a suffix with the result that the <b>semantic</b> <b>feature</b> of the suffix acts complementary to the <b>semantic</b> <b>features</b> of the reduplicated verb. In chapter 5 the morphological reduplication of ideophones is discussed. The <b>semantic</b> <b>features</b> of reduplication are characterised as intense, complete, purposeful and final. The formal features show that only disyllabic ideophones represent morphological reduplication that may be fully or only partially reduplicated...|$|R
