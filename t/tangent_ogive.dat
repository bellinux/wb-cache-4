Based on a slender body theory, the resulting simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations in a cross-flow plane are solved with Broyden's modified Newton-Raphson method. Total force coefficients are obtained through momentum principle with new expressions for nonconical flow. It is shown through the method of function deflation that multiple solutions exist at large enough angles of attack, even with symmetric separation points.

50|$|If this arc {{is drawn}} {{so that it}} meets the shank at zero angle (that is, the {{distance}} of the centre of the arc from the axis, plus the radius of the shank, equals the radius of the arc), then it is called a <b>tangent</b> or spitzer <b>ogive.</b> This is a very common ogive for high velocity (supersonic) rifle bullets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{profile of}} this shape is also formed by {{a segment of}} a circle, but {{the base of the}} shape is not on the radius of the circle defined by the ogive radius. The rocket body will not be tangent to the curve of the nose at its base. The Ogive Radius [...] is not {{determined}} by R and L (as it is for a <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive),</b> but rather is one of the factors to be chosen to define the nose shape. If the chosen Ogive Radius of a Secant Ogive is greater than the Ogive Radius of a <b>Tangent</b> <b>Ogive</b> with the same R and L, then the resulting Secant Ogive appears as a <b>Tangent</b> <b>Ogive</b> with a portion of the base truncated.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the chosen}} [...] {{is less than}} the <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive</b> , then the result will be a Secant Ogive that bulges out to a maximum {{diameter}} that is greater than the base diameter.

The profile of this shape is formed by a {{segment of a circle}} such that the rocket body is tangent to the curve of the nose cone at its base, and the base is on the radius of the circle.

50|$|Haack shapes or Sears-Haack {{bodies are}} not ogives or {{constructed}} {{from any other}} geometric figures. The shapes are instead mathematically derived streamlined bodies of revolution {{for the purpose of}} minimizing drag. Minimal projectile-shape variations can change the air-resistance and hence the effective range of high powered gun projectiles considerably, especially when they change velocity from the supersonic to the transonic and eventually to subsonic air flow regimes or vice versa during flight. For this kind of applications the Haack shape offers significantly improved characteristics compared to the <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive</b> or even the secant ogive often used for very-low-drag bullets and artillery shells. Only after the end of World War II have Haack shaped projectiles for artillery guns and sniper rifles been produced. Besides that Haack shapes are also applied in modern fast flying aircraft. Fighter aircraft are probably good examples of nose shapes optimized for the transonic region, although their nose shapes are often distorted by other considerations of avionics and inlets. For example, an F-16 nose appears to be a very close match to a Haack shape.|$|E

A computer code based on the method of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) has been developed to study numerically the supersonic flow around these cone shapes in rarefaction condition. In order to verify the computer code, the flow field in the slip regime is solved and compared with the results of Navier Stokes equation with the slip boundary condition.

Both models have base diameters of 3. 5 inches, and were tested in laminar flow conditions at angles-of-attack in the 30 - 60 deg range.

Surface pressure measurements and flow visualization results were obtained. Aft blowing was observed to alleviate the degree of vortex asymmetry at all angles of attack.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted in the Ames 12 -Foot Wind Tunnel to determine the subsonic aerodynamic characteristics of four forebodies at high angles of attack. The forebodies tested were a <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive</b> with fineness ratio of 5, a paraboloid with fineness ratio of 3. 5, a 20 deg cone, and a <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive</b> with an elliptic cross section. The investigation included the effects of nose bluntness and boundary-layer trips. The tangent-ogive forebody was also tested {{in the presence of}} a short afterbody and with the afterbody attached. Static longitudinal and lateral/directional stability data were obtained. The investigation was conducted to investigate the existence of large side forces and yawing moments at high angles of attack and zero sideslip. It was found that all of the forebodies experience steady side forces that start at angles of attack of from 20 deg to 35 deg and exist to as high as 80 deg, depending on forebody shape. The side is as large as 1. 6 times the normal force and is generally repeatable with increasing and decreasing angle of attack and, also, from test to test. The side force is very sensitive to the nature of the boundary layer, as indicated by large changes with boundary trips. The maximum side force caries considerably with Reynolds number and tends to decrease with increasing Mach number. The direction of the side force is sensitive to the body geometry near the nose. The angle of attack of onset of side force is not strongly influenced by Reynolds number or Mach number but varies with forebody shape. Maximum normal force often occurs at angles of attack near 60 deg. The effect of the elliptic cross section is to reduce the angle of onset by about 10 deg compared to that of an equivalent circular forebody with the same fineness ratio. The short afterbody reduces the angle of onset by about 5 deg...|$|E

Angle of attack was varied from 36 deg to 88 deg at zero sideslip. It was found that at low Reynolds numbers the forebody {{does not have a}} side force att high angles of attack; however, at Reynolds numbers above about 2 x 1 million, a side force occurs in the angle of attack range from 45 deg to 80 deg.

Three different span to body diameter ratios were tested with aspect ratios of 0. 022, 0. 044 and 0. 067. Aerodynamic loads were obtained and flow visualization was performed to gain an understanding of the lee side flow features. It was found that the global loads were independent of Mach number as is expected at incompressible speeds. The numerical centre-of-pressure predictions were validated experimentally for angles of attack higher than 6 degrees. The correlation below 6 degrees was only reasonable due to the relative higher balance uncertainties. Vortex separation was observed for all three span to body diameter configurations, whose locations did not correlate to that of an impulsively started flow for a flat plate. This indicated possible configuration specific phenomena or body-wing interactions...|$|E

Aerodynamic force and moment characteristics were measured for a cylindrical body with <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive</b> noses of fineness ratio 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5, and 5. 0. The cylindrical body was tested with an ogive nose having a rounded tip and an ogive nose with two different nose strake arrangements.

The data demonstrate that the aerodynamic characteristics for a body of revolution can be significantly affected by changes in nose fineness ratio, nose bluntness, Reynolds number, Mach number, and, of course, angle of attack. Nose strakes increased the normal forces but had little effect on the side forces that developed at subsonic Mach numbers for alpha greater than about 25.

A 3. 0 caliber <b>tangent</b> <b>ogive</b> body fitted with a cylindrical afterbody was tested in a wind tunnel under subsonic, laminar flow test conditions. Asymmetric blowing from both a single nozzle and a double nozzle configuration, positioned near the body apex, was investigated. Aft blowing was observed to alter the vortex asymmetry by moving the blowing-side vortex closer to the body surface while moving the non-blowing-side vortex further away from the body. The effect of increasing the blowing coefficient was to move the blowing-side vortex closer to the body surface at a more upstream location. The data also showed that blowing was more effective in altering the initial vortex asymmetry at the higher angles of attack than at the lower. The effects of changing the nozzle exit geometry were investigated and it was observed that blowing from a nozzle with a low, broad exit geometry was more effective in reducing the vortex asymmetry than blowing from a high, narrow exit geometry...|$|E
