Madgwick journeyed to England and the United States <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> agriculturalists, veterinarians, and specialists in animal husbandry. While Madgwick was gone, his deputy warden, James Belshaw, read a letter in the Australian Veterinary Journal from Gordon McClymont, a researcher in animal nutrition for the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, which advocated {{the establishment of a}} multi-disciplinary approach to farm science combining animal husbandry and agronomy.|$|E
5|$|Even after {{becoming}} a bishop, Bloet continued to witness royal writs, witnessing six of Rufus' writs while bishop, {{to add to}} his 11 witnessed writs during his chancellorship. Bloet {{was one of the}} bishops in 1097 that attempted to persuade Anselm when the archbishop was in a dispute with Rufus over travelling to Rome <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> the papacy.

In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem.

5|$|On June 21, the Congressional {{committee}} {{met again}} at the State House {{with members of the}} Pennsylvania Executive Council, including its president, John Dickinson.

Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to co-operate on hill {{design and}} event organisation, the venues at Kulm, Oberstdorf and Planica formed the KOP working group in 1962 (KOP being an {{abbreviation}} of Kulm/Oberstdorf/Planica).

5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} {{over what he}} saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned instead to the Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence.

5|$|The French foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, {{disapproved of}} Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, and Henry Laurens were {{appointed}} {{to collaborate with}} Adams; nevertheless, Jefferson {{did not go to}} Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic. Jay, Adams, and Franklin played the major part in the final negotiations. Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners.|$|E
60|$|This little visit {{had been}} an {{important}} one to Miss Panney; it had enabled her to understand Dora's character much better than she had understood it before; and she perceived {{that in this case}} of matchmaking she must not only do {{a great deal of the}} work herself, but she must do it without Dora's knowing anything about it. She liked this, for she was not much given <b>to</b> <b>consulting</b> <b>with</b> people.|$|R

5|$|With legal appeals, {{petitions}} from {{subjects and}} judicial queries of magistrates and governors, the emperors were careful <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> the jurists (iuris consulti), who were usually secretaries drafted from the equestrian order. From {{the reign of}} Augustus (27BC–AD14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial edicts (constitutiones), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship {{gave rise to the}} earliest law school system of the Western world, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.|$|E

As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.|$|E

5|$|Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was {{cut short}} by some ten months when he {{accepted}} an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice-regal appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and he took office on 21March. He succeeded Sir Alan Mansfield. Hannah {{did not have a}} strong connection with Queensland {{at the time of his}} appointment, and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951. He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) Charles Read.|$|E
5|$|King Philip, who {{ascended the}} Spanish throne in 1556, {{acknowledged}} {{the new political}} reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, {{who had grown up}} in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> Elizabeth.

Captain Edmund Beardsley Underwood was selected as Sebree's replacement, but that decision was not made official immediately, and Underwood remained in Washington <b>to</b> <b>consult</b> <b>with</b> Sebree and President Roosevelt on the governance of the territory. Underwood's selection was not announced until May 1903.|$|E

50|$|The Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which {{comprises}} the Small Animal Hospital and the Harry T. Peters, Jr. Large Animal Hospital, provides care to {{clients in the}} surrounding area. Since the hospital focuses on teaching, residents and interns work closely with clinical faculty members to provide care to small and large animals. Veterinary students in the DVM program participate in three-week clerkships designed to give them hands-on experience; these students welcome patients, record a case history, and conduct the initial examination of the animal prior <b>to</b> <b>consulting</b> <b>with</b> the supervising veterinarian.|$|R
