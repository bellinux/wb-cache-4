40|$|The five OAM flows are the following: F 5 : OAM {{information}} flows between network elements performing VC functions. From {{the perspective}} of a BISDN configuration, F 5 OAM operations are conducted between B-NT 2 /B-NT 1 endpoints. F 5 deals with degraded VC performance, such as late arriving cells, lost cells, cell insertion problems, etc. F 4 : OAM information flows between network elements performing VP functions. From {{the perspective of}} a BISDN configuration, F 4 OAM flows between B-NT 2 and ET. F 4 OAM reports on an unavailable path or a virtual path (VP) that cannot be guaranteed. F 3 : OAM information flows between elements that perform the assembling and disassembling of payload, header, and control (HEC) operations, and cell delineation. From {{the perspective of a}} BISDN configuration, F 3 OAM flows between B-NT 2 and VP cross connect and ET. F 2 : OAM information flows between elements that <b>terminate</b> <b>section</b> endpoints. It detects and reports on loss of frame synchronization and degraded error performance. From the perspective of a BISDN configuration, F 2 OAM flows between B-NT 2, B-NT 1, and LT, as well as from LT to LT. F 1 : OAM information flows between regenerator sections. It detects and reports on loss of frame an...|$|E

50|$|The STS-1 payload is {{designed}} to carry a full PDH DS3 frame. When the DS3 enters a SONET network, path overhead is added, and that SONET network element (NE) {{is said to be}} a path generator and terminator. The SONET NE is line terminating if it processes the line overhead. Note that wherever the line or path is <b>terminated,</b> the <b>section</b> is <b>terminated</b> also. SONET regenerators <b>terminate</b> the <b>section,</b> but not the paths or line.|$|R

2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating <b>section</b> and a <b>terminating</b> <b>section,</b> connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a line relay on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone off-hook, and a cutoff relay to keep the line relay from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the multiple switchboard, could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The final selector performed a sleeve test to detect a busy line when a subscriber was called.|$|R

5000|$|If a {{woman is}} fond of her {{children}} and brings them up all right, then I don't care if she sleeps with ten men a night. Jessie Vasey Perhaps the most controversial clause in the Repatriation Act was Section 43 which stated that a pension could be refused or terminated if the Board felt that the grant or continuance was undesirable. Any widow who remarried could expect to have her pension <b>terminated.</b> <b>Section</b> 43 was wielded as a morality clause against those found {{to be living in}} sin. Any widow suspected of having an affair was liable to have her pension terminated. To Vasey, this was an intolerable intrusion on the privacy of war widows, stripping them of their dignity. Vasey and Barnard publicly clashed over the issue between May and September 1949 and the offending clause was ultimately removed from the act.|$|R

40|$|Using {{transform}} techniques, a time dependent {{study has}} been made of the evanescent wave in a waveguide or similar dispersive medium, Firstly, the field created by the application of a unit step modulated carrier wave to an unterminated waveguide, cut-off with respect to the carrier frequency, has been investigated as a function of time and the distance from the point of application. The behaviour of the transverse electric and magnetic field components and the resulting Poynting vector has been presented graphically. Secondly, the interaction of nanosecond microwave carrier pulses with a <b>terminated</b> <b>section</b> of cut-off waveguide was investigated theoretically and experimentally. This waveguide was cut-off with respect to the carrier frequency and was interposed between two identical propagating guides. Under certain conditions it is possible to predict reflection and transmission times for the pulse on interaction with the cut-off guide. These reflection interaction times have been correlated with those measured experimentally. This time dependent study forms an extension of the steady state microwave analogue of the quantum mechanical tunnel effect...|$|R

25|$|The {{new line}} was {{initially}} not profitable, because Schøyens Bilcentraler had kept its concession to operate buses in the area. Not until the break-out of the Second World War was the bus route <b>terminated.</b> The <b>section</b> from Makrellbekken to Røa had initially been built with single track. This was upgraded to double track on 6 July 1939, {{at which time}} an overrun track was also installed. A level crossing with Sørkedalsveien was completed on 15 December.|$|R
50|$|The New Markham Vale Loop Road {{has been}} {{completed}} and opens up the former Markham coal field areas to development, linking the town to a new junction (29A) on the M1 motorway, this junction opened in early July 2008. This is part funded by European Union regeneration money. The scheme also reinstates part of the former Chesterfield Canal which crosses the route. There is a long term project to reinstate the canal from Chesterfield to Kiveton where it currently <b>terminates.</b> <b>Sections</b> from Chesterfield to Brimington were reinstated as part of previous stages of the Chesterfield Bypass and opencast schemes on part of the former Staveley Coal and Iron Company site {{which was part of}} British Steel Corporation following Nationalisation. The new Staveley Town Basin was officially opened on 30 June 2012 and forms the centre piece of the imaginative redevelopment of the Chesterfield Canal in Staveley. The basin is designed to provide facilities to enable the economic development of the isolated section in advance of full restoration. It will provide secure short- and long-term moorings, slipway, car parking, cycle racks, toilets and showers as well as a large open play area which can also be used for major waterway events and festivals.|$|R

40|$|We study {{inflation}} and entropy generation in a recently proposed pre-big-bang model universe produced in a collision of gravitational and dilaton waves. It is shown that enough inflation occurs provided the incoming waves are sufficiently weak. We also find that entropy {{in this model}} is dynamically generated {{as the result of}} the nonlinear interaction of the incoming waves, before the universe enters the phase of dilaton driven inflation. In particular, we give the scaling of the entropy produced in the collision in terms of the focusing lengths of the incoming waves. Comment: 10 pages, latex. 1 postscript figure included.

40|$|Interpretation Data flow {{analysis}} {{can be viewed}} as a form of abstract interpretation [15]. This is particularly useful for understanding type inferencing. A "concrete" interpreter for a language implements the standard (operational) semantics of the language, producing a sequence of states, where a state consists of an execution point, bindings of program variables to values, and so forth. An abstract interpreter does not implement the semantics, but rather computes information related to the semantics. For example, abstract interpretation may compute the sign of an arithmetic expression rather than its value. Often it computes a "conservative" estimate for the property of interest rather than computing exact information. Data {{flow analysis}} is simply a form of abstract interpretation that is guaranteed to <b>terminate.</b> This <b>section</b> presents a sequence of approximations to Icon semantics, culminating in one suitable for type inferencing...|$|R
