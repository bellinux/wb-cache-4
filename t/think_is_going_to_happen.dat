Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What you <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

5000|$|... "Having Missy Elliott on our track {{literally}} means {{everything to}} us. She's been my idol since I was little, I literally adore her, {{and every single}} interview that would ask who's your dream collaboration to work with, I'd always say Missy Elliott. We've all {{wanted to work with}} her, she's just a legend. And something you dream of, that you never <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> and then when it did, I cried my eyes out, we were just in shock. To actually just hear her and see her and then when we first heard the rap, I cried." [...] —Jesy Nelson talking to Joanne Dorken of MTV News UK about the group's collaboration with Missy Elliott on the song. Following the release of the third single from DNA, [...] "Change Your Life", Little Mix aspired to release [...] "How Ya Doin'?" [...] as the album's fourth single, but with a different marketing strategy to that of the previous single's release. In an interview with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy, Jade Thirlwall mentioned, [...] "It was tricky with 'Change Your Life' because a lot of fans already had it from the album, it's hard to push songs that have been available to buy for months already, whereas 'How Ya Doin'?' is a bit different." [...] The group were keen on the track featuring a guest appearance from another recording artist. Jesy Nelson told Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, [...] "We just wanted to change {{it up a little bit}} and make it more funky and, yeah, just give something a little bit different." [...] She added, [...] "And plus we've never had a feature on any of our singles." [...] An opportunity to have American rapper Missy Elliott feature on [...] "How Ya Doin'?" [...] then arose, which Little Mix pushed for. Speaking to Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror, Nelson said, [...] "As soon as we thought there might be a chance Elliott would appear on the track we did literally everything we could to make sure it happened." [...] A collaboration between the group and Elliott was then arranged by Little Mix's A&R team. Despite featuring on the group's song, Elliott never met up with Little Mix for the collaboration. Instead, the rapper recorded and co-wrote her verse in the United States in 2013. Elliott is considered an idol for Little Mix and her feature on the song was met with shock and disbelief from the group. Media outlets were also surprised by the feature, some noting Elliott's support of Misha B, Little Mix's fellow contestant, during their season on The X Factor, as reasoning. [...] "How Ya Doin'?" [...] was chosen as a single to sonically depict the group's old school music roots, who they were inspired by and a change in sound from their previous singles. Little Mix consider the song as [...] "a brilliant single that makes you want to dance." ...|$|E
40|$|The phrase “impact {{pathways}} ” (IPs) {{describes how}} project strategies and activities {{are expected to}} produce changes in the knowledge, attitudes, skills and practices of stakeholders. These changes {{are referred to as}} behavioral changes or outcomes. IPs may also include projections about how these outcomes are expected to contribute to social, environmental or economic change. “Participatory Impact Pathways Analysis ” (PIPA) is a practical planning, monitoring and evaluation approach developed for use with complex projects in the water and food sectors. It goes beyond the traditional use of logic models by engaging stakeholders in a structured process, promoting learning, and provides a framework for ‘action research ’ on change processes. Guided by structured questions a group of project participants and stakeholders describe what they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> during their project and beyond. This is done by examining two things: 1) why the problem the project is designed to solve exists, and 2) what the stakeholder’s relationships are and influence they have on the problem and each other. This tool describes the use of PIPA by researchers who face the following challenges: How to harness the project’s development potential from an early stage...|$|E
