500|$|Cratering is seen on {{both types}} of terrain, but is {{especially}} extensive on the dark terrain: {{it appears to be}} saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely <b>through</b> <b>impact</b> events. The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution. The density of cratering indicates an age of 4billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain). Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4billion years ago {{similar to that of the}} Moon. If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since. Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible. Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a [...] "ghost" [...] of a crater known as a palimpsest.|$|E

3000|$|The {{subsidies}} have {{an impact}} on utilization of services in two ways: (i) <b>through</b> their <b>impact</b> on expanding capacity and availability of services, and (ii) <b>through</b> their <b>impact</b> on affordability of services. In the model, investment grants {{have an impact}} on enrollments only <b>through</b> their <b>impact</b> on capacity. The “benefit”—in terms of financial gain—of the investment grant is fully realized by the service provider. The vouchers on the other hand increase affordability of the services for households and the assumption is that their benefit is fully realized by the household. The impact of the vouchers on enrollment is mainly <b>through</b> their <b>impact</b> on affordability of existing services for households; hence, we assume in the short term there will be no capacity impact of the vouchers in the system. 9 The operational grants fall somewhere in between in terms of their impact on enrollments. While the operational grant is received on a per child basis by the service provider, the model assumes that there is a “pass-through” of the operational grants to the households {{in the form of a}} reduction in prices. In other words, in our model, operational grants lead to decreases in the prices but the decrease in price is a portion (in this case assumed at 50 %) of the operational grant per child. 10 The benefits from the operational grant are assumed to be “shared” between the households and the service providers, hence the operational grant has an impact on enrollments both <b>through</b> its <b>impact</b> on enhanced capacity (through benefits realized by the service provider) and <b>through</b> its <b>impact</b> on affordability (<b>through</b> benefits realized by the household). 11 [...]...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{continue}} our investigations into robotic air hockey by studying the problem of controlling the trajectory of a puck subject to impacts. Impacts are modeled using the Routh two-dimensional impact model, which incorporates the effects of spin and friction. Using this model, we derive an explicit mapping between preimpact and postimpact velocities of the puck {{as a function of}} the velocities of the impacting objects and the coefficients of restitution and friction. We will see that this mapping depends fundamentally on whether or not relative sliding between the objects occurs throughout the duration of the impact event, or terminates during the impact. We then present results on planning of puck trajectories and control of the puck <b>through</b> <b>impacts</b> with a mallet or striker, which is essentially the problem of inverting the mapping between preimpact and postimpact velocities. Our results confirm the intuitive notion that a large coefficient of friction between the mallet and puck, and between the puck and table walls, enhances the ability to control puck motion <b>through</b> <b>impacts.</b> KEY WORDS—impacts, Routh model, impulsive manipulation, visual servoing, redundant manipulator, air hocke...|$|R
