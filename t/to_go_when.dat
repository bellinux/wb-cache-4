5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed {{into each other}} and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for the}} final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15m behind with only 50m <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>when</b> all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Grand Prix {{was led by}} Schumacher {{with only}} 16 laps <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>when,</b> {{for the first time}} since the 2000 French Grand Prix, Schumacher's car {{suffered}} an engine failure. Alonso won the race, giving himself a ten-point championship lead. With only one race left in the season, Schumacher could only win the championship if he won the season finale and Alonso scored no points.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>When</b> one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E

5|$|Micaëla {{enters with}} a guide, seeking José and {{determined}} to rescue him from Carmen ("Je dis que rien ne m'épouvante"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. José's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight ("Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ("Holà, holà José"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most evident on the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E

At Martinsville, he led 79 laps and was leading with ten laps <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> a caution came out for a wreck between Kyle Larson and Marcos Ambrose. On the resulting restart, Earnhardt was running 5th. During the restart, he slipped through the pack and overtook Tony Stewart for the lead in turn 4. He continued to hold the lead to win the race ahead of Jeff Gordon. It was Earnhardt's first career win at Martinsville.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal was run in wet {{conditions}} and provided many retirements, {{but also a}} new winner. Senna was comfortably leading with only three laps <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> engine problems forced him to retire, handing Boutsen his first victory. Patrese came home second {{to make it a}} 1–2 finish for Williams, the first time a team other than McLaren had achieved this since Ferrari in Monza the previous year. Making up for his Phoenix indiscretion, Andrea de Cesaris picked up third for Dallara, the first ever podium finish for the small Italian team.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, popular hosts Ed Coleman and Dave Sims {{had their}} show cancelled. WFAN then {{announced}} that New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica and WNBC-TV sports anchor Len Berman would co-host the new midday program. The show seemed all set <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when,</b> {{at the last}} minute, Berman decided {{to back out of}} the show. He cited {{that he would have to}} work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his WNBC-TV duties, which consisted of him appearing on all three of the station's evening newscasts. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed.|$|E

25|$|After this, Napoleon gave Spain to {{his brother}} Joseph Bonaparte and forced the Royal family into exile in Fontainebleau. Maria Luisa {{requested}} a separate residence and moved with her children to a house in Passy, but was soon moved to Compiegne on June 18. She was plagued by frequent sickness and shortage of money and, not owning any horses, was forced to walk wherever she needed <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>When</b> at last Napoleon sent 12,000 francs as the promised compensation, the expenses of her trip to France were discounted. She wrote a letter of protest, saying that prisoners were never made {{to pay for their}} removal, but she was advised not to send it out. She was promised to retire to the Palace of Colorno in Parma with a substantial allowance, but once in Lyon, under the pretext of conducting her to her destination, she was escorted to Nice, where she was kept under strict vigilance.|$|E
25|$|In the Kansas City Regional, both top seeds {{were upset}} in the {{semifinal}} round. Kentucky, led by 21 point from A'dia Mathies, {{opened up a}} lead ant he second half, extended it to 19 points, and were victorious, beating Nebraska 76–67 {{to advance to the}} regional finals. The regional semifinal game was a second of the season for Oklahoma and Notre Dame, a game the Irish has won in the regular season. In this game the score was tied early, while Oklahoma took a slim lead at the half. They extended the lead to eight points in the second half, but Notre Dame took the lead back at 50–49. With less than a minute to play, Oklahoma took a three-point lead, but Skyler Diggins hit a three-pointer to tie the game at 66 points each. Oklahoma had the ball for the last possession, but never got a shot off, so the game went to overtime. The game was tied with 72 points for each team with seconds <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> Oklahoma had another chance. This time, Nyeshia Stevenson hit a three-pointer, giving the Sooners a three-point lead with just over four seconds to go. Notre Dame tried a long inbounds pass, but were unsuccessful, and Oklahoma won 77–72.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{the day at}} 80/0, Australia {{lost both}} Simon Katich and Shane Watson LBW in quick {{succession}} within the first five overs. Ponting and Hussey then built an impressive partnership, sharing a stand of 127 runs before Ponting was run out by a direct hit from Andrew Flintoff fielding at mid-off, which marked an important {{turning point in the}} match. Michael Clarke was then run out in the very next over following some sharp fielding from Andrew Strauss at slip, while Marcus North was next <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> he left his ground to reach for a Greame Swann delivery but missed, allowing keeper Matt Prior to stump him before he could get back. Hussey and Haddin steadied the innings as Hussey reached his first century in 28 Test innings after earlier being dropped by Paul Collingwood on 55, but Haddin was eventually out for 34 attempting a big shot over mid-wicket, where he was caught in the deep by Strauss. Harmison took the wicket of Mitchell Johnson for a duck in the next over, and then removed Siddle and Clark in consecutive balls. Hilfenhaus survived the hat-trick ball, but the match only lasted another two overs as Hussey was caught by Cook at short leg off the bowling of Swann. England won the match by 197 runs, to claim a 2–1 series win.|$|E

500|$|Smythe {{applied to}} coach the Toronto St. Pats, but was {{rejected}} in favour of Mike Rodden. He continued to coach for the University of Toronto and took on a new senior team made up of University of Toronto players, called the Varsity Grads. The team won the Allan Cup, and represented Canada at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz the following year. Smythe refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>when</b> two Varsity Blues players he had promised {{could be part of}} the team were blocked by what he described as a [...] "pressure play" [...] from two Grads players to get relatives placed on the team instead.
