5|$|There {{are three}} types of Force powers; light, dark and neutral. Light Force powers provide nonviolent {{advantages}} such as being able to restore health or persuade enemies to ignore the player. Dark Force powers are violent and give the ability to throw objects or choke enemies. Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities such as being able to jump higher or run faster. There are fourteen powers in total, four of each type and a bonus power in each light and dark if the Jedi stays true to <b>that</b> <b>path.</b> Players earn stars to allocate toward Force powers by completing specific levels. By finding all the secrets in a level, players can also gain one bonus star to use. Between levels, the player can choose which Force powers to enhance by allocating stars to that power.

The receiver was granted partial approval to sell the project in April; 13 bids were received for the property and/or project, including from local firm Vulcan Real Estate, Las Vegas-based Molasky Group, and Chinese developer and original investor Binjiang Tower Corporation. On May 20, 2016, Judge James Robart approved a plan submitted by the receiver on behalf of Molasky and Binjiang, committing $30 million to the project and allowing for construction to resume pending final approval by foreign investors; Dargey approved the plan after a deal was struck with the new developers to pay $1.8 million of the attorney fees he had accrued during the trial.|$|E

25|$|Nigamananda {{pointed out}} that the path shown by Gouranga, who practiced and preached {{unconditional}} devotion and love for God, was rather narrow, inasmuch as it was directed to Sri Krishna as the only God. In order to broaden <b>that</b> <b>path,</b> Nigamananda suggested taking the master as an embodiment of Sri Krishna (or any other deity whom the aspirant loved), in which case the guide himself becomes the goal. In this way Nigamananda convincingly reconciled the two apparently contradictory creeds of Shankaracharya and Gauranga who advocated the principle and practice of apparent duality between the devotee and God. After all, Nigamananda {{pointed out that}} in the path of devotion and love the aspirant has to subdue or tame his ego adequately and hence he attains to the same stage as that of the monastic aspirant whose ego loses its identity on attaining to his goal. In the former case, the devotee's individuality is reduced to a trifle, overpowered by personal god-consciousness, whereas in the latter the aspirant loses his self-consciousness in the ocean of impersonal universal consciousness.|$|E
25|$|At {{certain times}} of the year these beaches can be covered with dried seaweed from the {{extensive}} marine vegetation under the waters of Western Port, however when the seaweed is not in season, all of Somers beaches boast clean sand. The South Beach has an intricate system of rock pools, this is both of great interest to beachcombers, and something of a curse, as the beach is a difficult place to swim. The Merricks Creek Inlet is a tidal creek that flows with the tides of Western Port. About 50cm {{below the surface of the}} sandbed of the creek lies a darker sand that gives off a hydrogen sulphide smell when disturbed. Sand all these beaches is generally fine grain mixed with crushed sea shells. Small reefs exist in a few places and can be seen at low tide, but these are only rocky reefs incapable of supporting coral. At low tide these reefs can make navigation near the beach difficult for watercraft and are clearly marked with buoys. A succession of big storm tides came in on 24 March, 25 March, 22 April, 23 April and 15 June 2011, severely eroding the sand dunes east the Merricks Creek. In 2012, the wooden wall that had fixed <b>that</b> <b>path</b> of the Merricks Creek since 1974, was taken down, as it was deemed unsafe and not adequately performing its job anymore. Starting in July 2012 and finishing in September 2012, a new rock wall was built, to fix the creek on a path straight into Westernport. For the three and a half years the wall has been in place, a noticeable buildup of sand has occurred east of the wall, while considerable erosion has occurred west of the wall. In November 2015, the entrance to the Merricks Creek was filled in with a sand groyne, as a short term solution to the constant hydrogen sulphide odour caused by the breakdown of sea grasses within the creek. As of June 2016, the sand groyne is still in place, and as such the surrounding beaches have benefitted with the buildup of sand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{metabolic}} {{network is}} an aggregation of enzyme catalyzed reactions that converts one compound to another. Paths in a metabolic network are {{a sequence of}} enzymes that describe how a chemical compound of interest can be produced in a biological system. As {{the number of such}} paths is quite large, many methods have been developed to score <b>paths</b> so <b>that</b> the k-shortest <b>paths</b> represent the set of <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> are biologically meaningful or efficient. However, these approaches do not consider whether the sequence of enzymes can be manufactured in the same pathway/species/localization. As a result, a predicted sequence might consist of groups of enzymes that operate in distinct pathway/species/localization and may not truly reflect the events occurring within cell. Results We propose a path weighting method CMPF (Class-switching Minimized Pathfinder) to search for routes in a metabolic network which minimizes pathway switching. In biological terms, a pathway is a series of chemical reactions which define a specific function (e. g. glycolysis). We conjecture that routes that cross many pathways are inefficient since different pathways define different metabolic functions. In addition, native routes are also well characterized within pathways, suggesting <b>that</b> reasonable <b>paths</b> should not involve too many pathway switches. Our method can be generalized when reactions participate in a class set (e. g., pathways, species or cellular localization) so <b>that</b> the <b>paths</b> predicted have minimal class crossings. Conclusions We show that our method generates k-paths that involve the least number of class switching. In addition, we also show <b>that</b> native <b>paths</b> are recoverable and alternative paths deviates less from native paths compared to other methods. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>paths</b> ranked by our method could be a way to predict <b>paths</b> <b>that</b> are likely to occur in biological systems. </p...|$|R
