5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees worked in <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment,</b> and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum {{to discuss the}} patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E

50|$|In 1913, Dr. Van Hoosen became {{head of the}} {{gynecological}} {{staff at}} Cook County Hospital in Chicago. Though she was a physician at multiple hospitals, she continued her private practice. She taught sex education, and wanted the use of scopolamine-morphine anesthesia for childbirth. She spoke against <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment's</b> discrimination against women and created a meeting among medical women, which led to <b>the</b> American <b>Medical</b> Women's Association in 1915.|$|R

25|$|Torrey was {{for many}} years an active advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Parents felt that he spoke up for them when much of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment</b> had {{previously}} held that parenting was responsible for schizophrenia.

25|$|Attlee's Health Minister, Aneurin Bevan, {{fought hard}} against the general disapproval of <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment,</b> {{including}} the British Medical Association, by creating the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. This was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all {{at the point of}} use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8Â½million dental patients and dispensed more than 5million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.|$|E
50|$|When the {{government}} was planning a governing organisation for doctors in 1847, Bernard lobbied to have dentistry included in the law that would establish the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada. This effort was unsuccessful largely due to <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment's</b> negative view of dentistry at that time. The Dental Association of the Province of Quebec was eventually formed in 1869 with Bernard as its founding President.|$|R

25|$|Jenner {{continued}} his research and reported {{it to the}} Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases. Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. <b>The</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment</b> deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolationthe use of smallpox to induce immunityand provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge.

25|$|Horrobin was {{an author}} on over 800 publications, {{including}} about 500 scientific papers, {{many of which}} appeared in journals he edited. Horrobin's belief in a connection between fatty acids and schizophrenia guided much of his career. From 1970, Horrobin was medical adviser to the Schizophrenia Society of Great Britain. He later served as the Society's president. Horrobin also wrote on other scientific issues. He considered research with animal models of human disease to {{be a waste of}} resources, and believed that large-scale clinical trials were unnecessary and unethical. However, in at least one case, he defended modern medicine by writing a critique of Ivan Illich's famous attack on <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment,</b> Medical Nemesis.|$|E
25|$|Douglas's {{number one}} {{concern was the}} {{creation}} of Medicare. He introduced medical insurance reform in his first term, and gradually moved the province towards universal medicare {{near the end of his}} last term. In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the going rate for service that doctors charged. <b>The</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment</b> claimed that Douglas would import foreign doctors to make his plan work and used racist images to try to scare the public.|$|E

50|$|The {{beliefs of}} Praxagoras held sway for centuries. For example, for nearly 500 {{years after his}} death, many still {{believed}} that arteries did not contain blood but pneuma.

25|$|The {{new school}} had {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment.</b> Jordan's {{aim was to}} reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise {{would have to go}} to London if they wanted to obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would comply with the requirements of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|E
25|$|Some awards {{have been}} controversial. This {{includes}} one to AntÃ³nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal leucotomy, bestowed despite protests from <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment.</b> Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who {{was included in}} the award. The 1952 prize to Selman Waksman was litigated in court, and half the patent rights awarded to his co-discoverer Albert Schatz who was not recognized by the prize. The 1962 prize awarded to James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for their work on DNA structure and properties did not acknowledge the contributing work from others, such as Oswald Avery and Rosalind Franklin who had died {{by the time of the}} nomination. Since the Nobel Prize rules forbid nominations of the deceased, longevity is an asset, one prize being awarded as long as 50 years after the discovery. Also forbidden is awarding any one prize to more than three recipients, and since in the last half century there has been an increasing tendency for scientists to work as teams, this rule has resulted in controversial exclusions.|$|E
25|$|Local {{doctors and}} medical {{officials}} had noticed {{for a long}} time an abnormally high frequency of cerebral palsy and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals including Masazumi Harada (later to receive an honour from the United Nations for his body of work on Minamata disease) set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients, but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> <b>establishment</b> believed the placenta would protect the foetus from toxins in the bloodstream, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with methylmercury: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the foetus.|$|E
