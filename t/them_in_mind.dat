5|$|As Hayes {{prepared}} to leave office, several delegations of reform-minded Republicans urged him to run against the incumbent Republican, John Sherman, for United States Senate. Hayes declined the offers, preferring to preserve party unity and retire to private life. Hayes especially looked forward to spending time with his children, two of whom (daughter Fanny and son Scott) {{had been born in}} the past five years. Initially, Hayes tried to promote railway extensions to his hometown, Fremont. He also managed some real estate he had acquired in Duluth, Minnesota. Not entirely removed from politics, Hayes held out some hope of a cabinet appointment, but was disappointed to receive only an appointment as assistant U.S. treasurer at Cincinnati, which he turned down. He agreed to be nominated for his old House seat in 1872 but was not disappointed when he lost the election to Henry B. Banning, a fellow Kenyon College alumnus. In 1873, Lucy gave birth to another son, Manning Force Hayes. That same year, the Panic of 1873 hurt business prospects across the nation, including Hayes's. Sardis Birchard died that year and the Hayes family moved into Spiegel Grove, the grand house Birchard had built with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo. His process for composing the music consisted of him reading the game's story, {{to get an}} as full as possible understanding of the setting and the character personalities. He considered his first impressions of the game's emotional flow and events to be very important: he would write them down together {{with the kind of}} music he would want to use for each scene, and keep <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when composing the music. He said that this approach, while taking longer than if he had just designated songs to various places in the game, made for higher quality music with a better relation to the game's worldview.|$|E

500|$|For the Xbox 360 version, {{the team}} {{introduced}} a feature {{to reduce the}} colour saturation {{in the game and}} allow players to decide how much colour they wanted to have. Levius acknowledged that this feature [...] "is a big thing for me and Petr as we always wanted to also have a black and white version of the game in style of Jules Verne's illustrations". He also commented that several other features, such as more animations and leaderboards, were left out {{due to a lack of}} time, but he kept <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for a possible sequel.|$|E
500|$|Development of Silent Hill 2 {{began in}} June 1999, {{directly}} {{after the completion}} of its predecessor. The game was created by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The story was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), with individual members of the team collaborating on the actual scenario. The main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato who provided the dialog for the female characters. Silent Hill 2s budget has been estimated at US$7–10 million by Sato, in contrast with the previous installment's estimated cost of US$3–5 million. The decision to produce a sequel to Silent Hill was partly a financial one, as it had been commercially successful, and partly a creative one, as the team had faced difficulties while working on the original game. The team was given a small window to settle on a platform. As it was unable to gather information on the then-unannounced GameCube and Xbox consoles, they began production of the game for the PlayStation 2. Producer Akihiro Imamura stated that the decision was also influenced by [...] "a wish from the business section that we move rapidly on the PS2. You know, it is currently the market focus". Imamura read all comments about the original game and kept <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> while working on Silent Hill 2. He estimated that a total of fifty people worked on the game: while the creative team from the first game remained, they had to bring in thirty people from Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. Developed at the same time, the PlayStation 2 version of Silent Hill 2 and its Xbox port debuted at the March 2001 Tokyo Game Show to positive reactions.|$|E

60|$|The cosmogony {{from which}} such an idea was derived was simple enough.

Men must have forms and ceremonies to put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> of the spiritual truths which they cannot see or handle. Men cannot get on without them; and those who throw away the Church forms have to invent fresh ones, and less good ones, for themselves.|$|E
