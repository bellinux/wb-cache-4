5|$|Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who {{described}} Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded {{much of the}} Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in his description of Egypt in The Histories, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided a summary of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in his Bibliotheca historica. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote the most complete ancient account of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis of Egyptian religious beliefs. Plutarch's account of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of Egyptian beliefs. For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations of Egyptian belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> contains portions with no known parallel in Egyptian tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work {{as a whole was}} not based directly on Egyptian sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.|$|E

5|$|Both {{civilian}} and military authorities considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian contribution to the German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to <b>the</b> <b>myth)</b> only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes {{that could not be}} denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> of the clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
6000|$|When Christianity became powerful, the Christian writers {{naturally}} attacked heathen religion {{where it}} was most vulnerable, {{on the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>myths,</b> and of <b>the</b> mysteries which were dramatic representations of <b>the</b> <b>myths.</b> [...] "Pretty gods you worship," [...] said the Fathers, in effect, [...] "homicides, adulterers, bulls, bears, mice, ants, and what not." [...] The heathen apologists for the old religion were thus driven in the early ages of Christianity to various methods of explaining away <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> of their discredited religion.|$|R

50|$|Classical mythology {{is a term}} {{often used}} to {{designate}} <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> belonging to <b>the</b> Greek and Roman traditions. <b>The</b> <b>myths</b> {{are believed to have}} been acquired first by oral tradition, entering since Homer and Hesiod (ca. 700 BC) the literate era; later works by those who studied or collected <b>the</b> <b>myths,</b> or sometimes all literary works relating to mythology, are known as mythography and those who wrote them as mythographers. A classical myth as it appears in later Western culture is usually a syncretism of various versions from both Greek and Latin sources.|$|R

5|$|In {{spite of}} these facts, <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> lived on: in his Histoire de la révolution française, Adolphe Thiers wrote an account repeating Barère's version, where Vengeur refused to surrender. In 1847 Alphonse de Lamartine even invented the story that Renaudin had been killed heroically, cut in half by a cannon shot like Dupetit-Thouars.|$|E
5|$|Other {{types of}} {{religious}} texts give evidence for <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to {{events in the}} annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death {{as well as the}} resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date back to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages in the development of <b>the</b> <b>myth.</b> Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.|$|E
5|$|Parts of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> {{appear in}} a wide variety of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account of <b>the</b> <b>myth,</b> and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E
