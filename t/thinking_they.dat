5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had no idea what she was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. <b>Thinking</b> <b>they</b> were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man patrol northward to locate the North Koreans. Near Poun, the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching. The platoon took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons. The North Koreans halted their advance, <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> had encountered a major position, and held back until daylight. When they turned back, the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E

Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown {{with the intention of}} reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> would not encounter any problems, assuming all the Confederates surely had heard of Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise they encountered Confederates that did not know of Lee's surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started <b>thinking,</b> <b>they</b> would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Home Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} a DVD and Blu-ray disc combo pack in the United States on March 20, 2012. Bonus features include a commentary from Fincher, featurettes on Blomkvist, Salander, the sets and locations, etc. The disc artwork for the DVD version of the film resembles a Sony brand DVD-R, {{a reference to the}} hacker Lisbeth Salander. This caused a bit of confusion in the marketplace with consumers <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> had obtained a bootleg copy. The release sold 644,000 copies in its first week, in third place behind The Muppets and Hop. The following week, the film sold an additional 144,000 copies generating $2.59 million in gross revenue. As of January 2014, 1,478,230 units had been sold, grossing $22,195,069.|$|E

5|$|The {{synonyms}} {{are other}} binomial names that were given {{over time to}} this taxon by authors who were unaware that the specimens they were describing belonged to a species already described by Linnaeus; in some cases, local variations in colour and form may have misled these authors into <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> had a different species. Strombus vanicorensis is a subsequent, changed spelling of Strombus vanikorensis {{by one of the}} original authors. There is some disagreement in the literature {{as to whether or not}} this taxon and the similar-looking Laevistrombus turturella are actually separate species. Leo Man In 'T Veld and Koenraad de Turck (1998) considered that L.canarium and L.turturella are distinct (yet sympatric) species, based mainly on the shell morphology and a radula comparison. However, when Zaidi Che Cob reviewed a number of Strombus species in 2009, examining both shell characters and anatomical data including details of the genitalia, operculum and radula, he concluded that L.turturella was simply a morphotype, and therefore a synonym of L.canarium.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and rhenium. Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E

5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{planned to}} {{fight their way}} out eastward but—using a local double agent, usually known by his cover of François Toli—attempted to deceive Bonaparte into <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> would try to march north, cross the Po, and head for Milan, joined by the {{remaining}} troops marching up from Genoa. The spy would advise Bonaparte to march via Sale on the northern side of the plain, {{so that he could}} be engaged by the Austrian left wing; meanwhile the main force would move through Marengo village in the centre, turn north, and fall into the French left flank. Ott arrived from Montebello of 13 June in a war council. The senior generals of the Austrian army strongly approved this plan, as the alternative would have meant that the Austrian army would have had to retreat along the river Po and leave Piedmont to the enemy without a fight. Nonetheless, by abandoning the San Giuliano plain, where the superior Austrian cavalry could have given him an edge, Melas probably made a serious mistake.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, <b>thinking</b> <b>they</b> were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E
