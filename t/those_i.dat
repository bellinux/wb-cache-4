One by one they passed in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all <b>those</b> <b>I</b> had been afraid of, all <b>those</b> <b>I</b> once could have laughed at, all <b>those</b> <b>I</b> had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E

I chased them and shot them down—such a horrible thing to do. Now, I go to the kindergarten every day and interact with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.|$|E

He wrote of [...] through the stacks of that great library like some damned soul, never at restever leaping ahead from the pages I read to {{thoughts}} of <b>those</b> <b>I</b> want to read"; his alter ego Eugene Gant read with a watch in his hand, [...] "laying waste of the shelves." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2002 Scripps Treasure Coast Publishing interview, Raucher lamented never {{hearing from}} {{her again and}} {{expressed}} his hope {{that she was still}} alive. Raucher's novelization of the screenplay, with the dedication, [...] "To <b>those</b> <b>I</b> love, past and present," [...] serves more as the tribute to Seltzer that he had intended the film to be, with the focus of the book being more on the two boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy. Consequently, the book also mentions Seltzer's death, which is absent from the film adaptation.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{used the}} phrase in {{concluding}} a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden on October 31, 1968. Recalling the visit to Deshler, the Republican candidate stated, [...] "There were many signs like <b>those</b> <b>I</b> see here. But one sign held by a teenager said, 'Bring Us Together Again'. My friends, America needs to be brought together." [...] However, Nixon's use of the phrase received little coverage until after the election. Deshler school officials heard of the speech, and asked students about the sign, but no one came forward.|$|E

[...] "Marty [...] had started writing before me, and sent me some of his ideas," [...] Salvatori said. [...] "I picked a few that I felt I could add some magic to, and worked on <b>those.</b> <b>I</b> also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that {{he put his hands}} on." [...] Once the duo felt they had enough material, the Chicago-based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after <b>those.</b> <b>I</b> was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E
500|$|A {{letter to}} Hagenauer dated 16 August {{indicated}} that Leopold wished {{to proceed to}} Turin, then across northern Italy to Venice, and home via the Tyrol. [...] "Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses", he wrote, but added: [...] "...I have said I shall go [...] home and I shall keep my word". The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: [...] "I wrote for him [...] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, {{thought it was a}} miracle. The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for <b>those</b> <b>I</b> had written". This claim, that Wolfgang improvised when faced with passages he could not play, appears to be the only adverse comment from all those called upon to test him.|$|E

500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script of The Orphanage was written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996. Sánchez was not sure why he chose to write a genre film for the screenplay, as he explains, [...] "I ended up writing a film {{in the style of}} <b>those</b> <b>I</b> liked as a kid, movies like Poltergeist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby which I ruined on the first VCR we owned at home." [...] Sánchez {{revealed}} the literary influences underlying his writing of the script, such as The Turn of the Screw and Peter Pan. Sánchez originally wanted to direct the script but he was repeatedly turned down by various Spanish production companies. While Sánchez was working on the short film 7337 in 2004, he met with director Juan Antonio Bayona and offered him the script to direct. Bayona accepted the opportunity [...] because he felt that a fantasy themed script like that of The Orphanage would allow him freedom as a director, saying the fantasy genre was a great tool for learning as it [...] "allows manipulation of space and time as we wish or the use of certain camera moves with an immediate efficiency".|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing <b>those,</b> <b>I</b> think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{statement}} {{met with}} strong criticism, {{as the film}} deals mainly with the Holocaust.

In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say." ...|$|E
