5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E

25|$|Monday night games {{early in}} the season are often highly {{anticipated}} since records are new, teams usually are showcasing fresh talent and potential, and storylines coming into the season are often played out as fans <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if these hyped teams are up to form. Since no one knows during the first month of the season if a team is indeed good, or will rebound from a difficult start, interest is usually high for the first few weeks of the MNF season.|$|E
25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do everything possible to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E
500|$|Gilliam {{used the}} same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), {{including}} the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses). The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology. You <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear.

500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land. Like images about old age and {{experience}} found in East Coker, this image reinforces the {{need to look at the}} whole of life and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things beyond the limitations of time. Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour.

Rodman was not able to meet with Kim Jong Un, but met instead with the nation's Minister of Sports and handed off several gifts for Kim Jong Un, including two signed basketball jerseys, two soap sets, and a copy of Donald Trump's 1987 book, [...] "". Other gifts believed to be intended for the leader's daughter, included a [...] "Where's Waldo?" [...] book and a jigsaw puzzle of a mermaid.|$|E
500|$|Nolan's work explores existential, {{ethical and}} {{epistemological}} themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, {{the nature of}} time, causality and construction of personal identity. [...] "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, {{that we are all}} stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on what we all agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one {{of the ways in which}} we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things from the same point of view". Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. [...] "Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes." ...|$|E

500|$|After half time, Dortmund {{were handed}} a {{way back into}} the match when Márcio Amoroso was brought down by Patrick Paauwe. Paauwe was spared Kohler's fate as he only {{received}} a yellow card. Amoroso scored the following penalty and the score was 2–1. Two minutes later, Amoroso was cautioned for diving in an attempt to win another spot kick. Just three minutes after Dortmund scored, Jon Dahl Tomasson who was playing his last game for Feyenoord before his move to Milan, [...] scored after beating the offside trap, and being put through by Shinji Ono. Dortmund once again found a {{way back into the}} match when Jan Koller volleyed home his shot from 25 metres on 58 minutes, after capitalizing on a weak defensive header. [...] Dortmund now assumed the ascendancy with attack after attack, whilst Feyenoord seemed content to sit back and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the game out. Dortmund tried everything to find the equaliser replacing Lars Ricken with Jörg Heinrich, and Ewerthon was replaced by Otto Addo, however it was to no avail as Feyenoord saw the game out to win 3–2 and continue their streak of never losing a European final.|$|E
