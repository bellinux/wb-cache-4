5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics {{is a blend of}} Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> the English-speaking world.|$|E

5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf,</b> <b>and</b> that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.|$|E

5|$|The major {{application}} of uranium {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted uranium (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} status as the largest {{warships}} in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not {{just in terms of}} a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> off the coast of Somalia.|$|E

The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> Red Sea in September–November 1933.

5|$|During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 {{flights and}} about 4,100 flight hours, {{with a mission}} {{availability}} rate of over 90 percent. Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy surface-to-air missiles, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an attrition rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the F-117 Nighthawk and AH-64 Apache—that {{played a crucial role}} in the war. In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch.

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> Red Sea in September–November 1933.

The ship was refitted at Sheerness Dockyard between 3 September and 23 October 1934 for service on the China Station with the 8th (later the 21st) Destroyer Flotilla and arrived there in January 1935. She {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in the Red Sea from September 1935 to May 1936 during the Abyssinian Crisis and made port visits in Bombay and East Africa before returning to Hong Kong on 7 August. On one occasion in 1937 Diana investigated why a lighthouse near Amoy was not lit and discovered that it had been attacked by pirates. She remained in the Far East until the rise in tensions before World War II began prompted her recall in August 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Navy {{participated in a}} number of {{conflicts}} {{after the end of the}} Cold War. After diplomatic efforts failed, the Navy was instrumental in the opening phases of the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq; the ships of the navy launched hundreds of Tomahawk II cruise missiles and naval aircraft flew sorties from six carriers in <b>the</b> <b>Persian</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>and</b> Red Sea. The battleships Missouri and Wisconsin fired their 16-inch guns for the first time since the Korean War on several targets in Kuwait in early February. In 1999, hundreds of Navy and Marine Corps aircraft flew thousands of sorties from bases in Italy and carriers in the Adriatic against targets in Serbia and Kosovo to try to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. After a 78-day campaign Serbia capitulated to NATO's demands.|$|E
