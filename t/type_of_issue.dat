500|$|Niki Payne of the Philadelphia Examiner said [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] was [...] "probably {{one of my}} all-time {{favorite}} episodes of South Park right now" [...] {{because it was so}} on point concerning the double standards between men and women.

2500|$|Four years earlier, he {{had been}} unsure if a {{mutually}} agreeable non-abusive same sex relationship would be acceptable within the general principles of Buddhism. However, he had difficulty imagining the mechanics of homosexual sex, saying that nature had arranged male and female organs [...] "in such {{a manner that is}} very suitable... Same-sex organs cannot manage well." [...] The Dalai Lama has repeatedly said to LGBT groups that he can't rewrite the texts. He thinks that this is the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> that would need to be discussed by a council of Buddhist elders from all Buddhist traditions. Only such a council could amend issues concerning Vinaya and ethics. The Dalai Lama also recommends the issue of the equality of women, particularly in monastic rituals and ceremonies, to be reconsidered and revised.|$|E

50|$|A problem {{occurs when}} looking at current issues versus {{long-term}} issues. Ideally the tasking should be 50/50 {{so that no one}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> gets more analysis than the other. In an ever changing world {{there is a tendency to}} place more emphasis on tactical/current issues. This hinders the operational/long term issues by putting analysis of them off in favor of current issues.|$|E
5000|$|As {{stated by}} Saunders,"This {{multitude}} of issues makes modern conflict sites...multi-layered landscapes...that require robust interdisciplinary approaches."(Saunders, pg. x). Conflict archaeology addresses any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> regardless of size or effect, more importantly the residual effects felt from the conflict itself upon the surrounding populations. [...] "In this view the constantly shifting multidimensional aftermaths of conflict {{are as important}} as the conflict themselves." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, {{marriage}} and family therapists perform assessment and treatment over mental and emotional problems in families and couples. LCPC employed as {{marriage and family}} therapists utilize techniques of family systems to help clients get over crisis and improve communication. They also give treatment to families dealing with drug use and mental disorders. Group therapy is often incorporated with individual therapy in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

50|$|Vehicle Instability: An {{unstable}} vehicle may {{be subject}} to rollover accidents. During the 1990s and early 2000s, there were a large number of accidents that involved vehicle's rolling over. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> led to a product liability claims against a number of SUV models, which had a higher-than-normal center of gravity. Because they are taller and narrower, SUVs, or sports utility vehicles, are {{three times more likely to}} roll over in an accident than are other passenger cars.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> that {{is closely}} studied is the {{browning}} of seafood. Seafood, in particular shrimp, is a delicacy consumed by {{people all over}} the world.The browning of shrimp which is actually referred to as Melanosis, creates a great concern for food handlers and consumers. Melanosis mainly occurs during postmortem handling and refrigerated storage. Recent studies have found a plant extract that acts as an anti melatonin polyphenol oxidase inhibitor and serves the same function as sulfites but without the health risks.|$|E

50|$|Prevention Science is the {{application}} of a scientific methodology that seeks to prevent or moderate major human dysfunctions before they occur. Regardless of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> on hand, the factors that lead to the problem must be identified and addressed. Prevention research is thus focused primarily on the systematic study of these potential precursors of dysfunction, also known as risk factors; as well as components or circumstances that reduces the probability of problem development in the presence of risk, also known as protective factors. Preventive interventions aim to counteract risk factors and reinforce protective factors in order to disrupt processes or situations that give rise to human or social dysfunction.|$|E
5000|$|Large help desks have {{a person}} or team {{responsible}} for managing the incoming requests, called [...] "issues"; they are commonly called queue managers or queue supervisors. The queue manager {{is responsible for the}} issue queues, which can be set up in various ways depending on the help desk size or structure. Typically, large help desks have several teams that are experienced in working on different issues. The queue manager will assign an issue to one of the specialized teams based on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> raised. Some help desks may have telephone systems with ACD splits ensuring that calls about specific topics are put through to analysts with the requisite experience or knowledge.|$|E
50|$|A {{manifest}} {{like the}} one above is parsed into an activation context by the SxS loader. There is a stack of activation contexts for each thread or fiber. An API allows programmatic manipulation of these contexts. It may be necessary for a library (DLL) to change its activation context, for example if it requires a specific version of another library for its own consumption instead of using the activation context of its caller. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> is sometimes called (activation context) pollution. To prevent polluting its activation context, a DLL can have a manifest embedded as a resource, which is parsed when the DLL is loaded. This manifest must be at resource id 2 in the image file for the loader to find it.|$|E

50|$|There are six {{residence}} halls {{on campus}} (South, East, Francis E. Hazard, McConnell, Sycamore, Ross, and Hickory Halls). Urbana's residence halls emphasize civic responsibility, mutual respect, mature interpersonal relationships, multicultural understanding, and community engagement. Students living on campus forge friendships that {{last a lifetime}} while learning about different cultures, backgrounds and ideas, gaining an understanding {{of being part of}} a community, and developing their leadership skills. Residential living provides students with life skills which are transferable to careers and other aspects of independent living after graduation. Advice and guidance are available from trained upperclass student resident assistants and undergraduate hall directors. Resident assistants live on each floor of each residence hall and serve as a resource for students dealing with any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> The University's Student Conduct programs were recognized as Ohio's most innovative Student Affairs program in 2014 by the Ohio College Personnel Association.|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to contributing from analysis of empirically framed scholarship to illuminating {{the area of}} new mediascapes, what do {{the findings of this}} study offer in terms of mundane political languaging or the “ways-with-words” (Heath 1983) and the concomitant identity-positions or “ways-of-being” (Bagga-Gupta 2014) across GSN settings? Furthermore, in {{addition to}} making relevant a multi-theoretical and multi-disciplinary stance, what new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> have been made visible when empirical datasets across GSN settings are focused upon within the same analytical framings? Going beyond decolonial framings where global-North hegemonies are commonly articulated, does an engagement with decoloniality (in particular in an empirical study) contribute in specific ways to current concerns regarding communication and diversity in the global-North? These are the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> that this study has attempted to explore and can contribute towards. These are discussed broadly in this final section.|$|R
