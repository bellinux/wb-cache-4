5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1839. Its subsequent taxonomic history has been complex, riddled with confusion with Trachylepis maculata and other species, homonyms, and other problems. The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus Trachylepis and {{is thought to have}} reached its island from Africa by rafting. <b>The</b> <b>enigmatic</b> Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, may well be the same species.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly to an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E

5|$|One Ferugliotherium tooth {{is thought}} to be a first upper molariform (MF1). It is almost {{rectangular}} and bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. There are five cusps in the middle row, which is oriented obliquely, four cusps in one of the rows {{on the side of the}} tooth, and two or three in the other row on the side. As in the lower molariforms, the cusps are connected by transverse ridges and separated by furrows. LACM 149371, <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> possibly ferugliotheriid tooth from Peru, is a triangular tooth bearing six or seven cusps, which are connected by crests and surround two deep fossae (basins) and a third shallower fossa.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force {{opens with}} Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated {{that they have}} not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. When it seems as if Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{described}} in 1903 by Guillaume Grandidier from subfossil material collected in the cave of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar. The Hypogeomys material {{was similar to the}} living Hypogeomys antimena, but distinct enough for Grandidier to recognize it as a separate species, different in size and some morphological details. Grandidier described another subfossil Hypogeomys species in 1912, H.boulei, but the material that species was based on was later identified as <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> mammal Plesiorycteropus. In 1946, Charles Lamberton illustrated another femur (upper leg bone) of H.australis; the origin and current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown. In 1996, Steven Goodman and Daniel Rakotondravony reviewed the distribution of Hypogeomys and confirmed that H.australis is a distinct species. H.australis and H.antimena are classified together within the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rose deduces {{that she}} and Mickey were kept alive because their touch can {{activate}} the Genesis Ark. Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the Ark because it is stolen Time Lord technology. He demands that Rose open it, but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives. The Doctor realises that these Daleks are <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> Cult of Skaro, and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber. As the Cybermen attack the Daleks, Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping. The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. The Doctor and his companions flee into the tower. Along the way, Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis Ark open and millions of Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War pour out and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below, though humanity is {{caught in the crossfire}} and many are killed while running for cover.|$|E
5|$|Sora {{returns as}} the game's protagonist. Donald Duck and Goofy are less {{involved}} in the gameplay and story. Like the first game, Chain of Memories features numerous characters from both the Final Fantasy series and the Disney animated features canon. Being a direct sequel, many of the characters from the first Kingdom Hearts reappear in this game. As each world and the related characters are recreated from Sora's memories, they interact with Sora {{as if they had}} never met before. The game also introduces a handful of new characters. Several are members of <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> Organization. Other new characters include Naminé, a young girl capable of manipulating memories, and DiZ, a mysterious man concealed by red robes and bandages. Riku appears as a playable character in the second story mode. After being sealed in the realm of darkness, Riku heads to the basement of Castle Oblivion. He is aided by King Mickey and DiZ.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} dipterans known {{are from the}} Middle Triassic (around 240 million years ago), and they became {{widespread}} during the Middle and Late Triassic. Modern flowering plants did not appear until the Cretaceous (around 140 million years ago), so the original dipterans {{must have had a}} different source of nutrition other than nectar. Based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets, {{it has been suggested that}} they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap-sucking bugs which were abundant at the time, and dipteran mouthparts are well-adapted to softening and lapping up the crusted residues. The basal clades in the Diptera include the Deuterophlebiidae and <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> Nymphomyiidae. Three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record. Many new species of lower Diptera developed in the Triassic, about 220 million years ago. Many lower Brachycera appeared in the Jurassic, some 180 million years ago. A third radiation took place among the Schizophora at the start of the Paleogene, 66 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, in Wings of Liberty, Kerrigan and the Zerg {{suddenly}} vanish {{from the}} Koprulu Sector, allowing the Protoss {{to once again}} take on a passive role in the galaxy. Meanwhile, Raynor forms a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor liberates the local population from Dominion control and also discovers a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. The Zerg suddenly reappear and overrun Mar Sara, forcing Raynor to arrange an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion. The Raiders embark {{on a series of}} missions to undermine Mengsk, stop frequent Zerg infestations on Terran worlds, gather psychic individuals for military assets, and find the remaining pieces of the Xel'Naga artifact, which they sell to <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Soon after, Zeratul delivers a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out the Terrans and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond. After collecting more artifact pieces, the Raiders forge an alliance with Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus' son, who is their secret benefactor from Moebius Foundation. After recovering the final artifact piece, Valerian and Raynor work together to invade the Zerg world of Char and use the artifact to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg at the cost of much of the Dominion fleet. An agent of Arcturus makes an attempt on Kerrigan's life, and Raynor defends her and takes her in for medical examination.|$|E
5|$|The game {{proceeds}} {{according to}} the Courier's decisions and involves many different events, factions, and characters. The main storyline follows the Courier's pursuit of Benny to both settle the score and retrieve the Platinum Chip. Along the way, the Courier encounters many groups of people with various problems that they can choose to assist with, ignore, or otherwise sabotage, resulting in positive or negative karma. Eventually, after finding Benny and the Chip, the Courier finds themselves {{in the middle of}} a conflict between three major factions: Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers, the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist democratic federation, and Mr. House (voiced by René Auberjonois), <b>the</b> <b>enigmatic</b> de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. It is revealed that Mr. House, a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber, ordered the Platinum Chip's delivery before the war. The Chip is a data storage device with a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness, and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man.|$|E
