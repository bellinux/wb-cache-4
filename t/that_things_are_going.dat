5|$|Johnson's wife Shelly {{is having}} breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay {{the idea of}} {{shooting}} Johnson, while they toy with Shelly's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelly attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss their spouses. Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> nowhere, leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where Laura and Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.|$|E

25|$|Most battles {{confirm the}} way <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> already; Plevna {{is one of}} the few engagements which changed the course of history. It is {{difficult}} to see how the Ottoman Empire could have survived in Europe...if the Russians had reached Constantinople in July; probably it would have collapsed in Asia as well. Plevna...gave the Ottoman Empire another forty years of life.|$|E
60|$|For six nights, I {{had been}} worried this in Master B.'s room, when I began to {{perceive}} <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> wrong.|$|R
60|$|It was evident, indeed, as they entered, <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{well with}} the wounded man, who was talking merrily to his daughter.|$|R

25|$|In Henry's suite, {{he realizes}} <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> too fast, and {{afraid of what}} might happen, he sneaks out and heads back to his house in the suburbs. Upon his return to their home, he is upset {{by the fact that}} Helen is not at home. In Helen's suite, she is {{confused}} by the effect that McKenzie's attention is having on her. Putting him off, she tells him that she will give him an answer in the morning. After he leaves, she is afraid of her feelings, and she heads back to her home. After she arrives, she and Henry realize that the two really love each other, and they reconcile.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> so {{hard for}} you, in a {{financial}} way, it would be some satisfaction to feel that your daughter's future was safe," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|However, Dorothy now {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> {{different with}} her uncle and aunt {{from this time}} forth, so after giving the matter deep thought she decided to ask Ozma to grant her a very great favor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, to hear it, Major, and I {{hoped that}} you would have {{something}} of the sort to tell me. There was a look about you both that I took to mean <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To me," [...] Hamel {{declared}} frankly, [...] "you look worried. If I hadn't {{heard so}} much of the success of your political career {{and all the rest of}} it, I should have thought <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> badly with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course I am glad <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> well. Your {{accident}} {{this afternoon}} was lucky, too, in a way, was it not? It will interest {{people in the}} play.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Mr Considine," [...] he said, {{putting on}} his hat, [...] "are you {{disposed}} for a ride? I take a look round the farm every morning to see <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> straight. Will you join me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Because,' said he, `now <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> smooth, I {{must go to}} England by {{the first}} ship that sails, and get my affairs there put on a better footing, so you must stay here to look after my business, and to--to--take care of Lizette.' ...|$|E
50|$|This song {{is about}} young {{people living in}} the Northeast of America. Their lives are miserable because the steel {{factories}} are closing down. They desperately want to leave... but they stay because they were brought up to believe <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get better. Maybe that sounds familiar.|$|R
60|$|He {{found him}} {{gambling}} {{in a low}} place with the men, who were bound to have his money; and {{by the look of}} relief on Blair's anxious face when he saw him Dan knew without words <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> badly with him, and he saw the peril too late.|$|R
25|$|Back in Europe, {{interest}} in the new Technikum was kept high. In 1909 Dr. Chaim Weizmann, who would later become President of the State of Israel, reported to a Zionist conference in Manchester <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> well with the “National Polytecnikum”. Wealthy Jews from many lands were already promising generous support.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's no {{judging from}} her joyous surface, but I have thought him looking more careworn and anxious than I liked. Mr. Dutton, don't answer if I {{ought not to}} ask, but is it true <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> wrong? I know you have been seeing Mr. Greenleaf, so perhaps you are in his {{confidence}} and cannot speak.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on well, at present, Patsey. You see, we are {{fighting}} on our own ground, and fifty thousand men can be called to arms {{in the course of}} a few hours, by the ringing of the church bells. We have no baggage, no waggons, no train of provisions; we are ready to fight at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mahmud {{has many}} cares. The men are furious {{because he will}} not lead them out to fight. Even the emirs are sullen; and Osman Digna, who was on bad terms with him a short time ago, and who, Mahmud suspects, is {{intriguing}} with them against him, is foremost in urging that an attack should take place; though everyone knows he is a coward, and never shows himself in battle, always running away directly he sees <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> against him. Still, he has five thousand followers of his own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brawly," [...] said he. [...] "Andie picks {{him up at}} Gillane Sands to-morrow, Wednesday. He was keen to say good-by to ye, but the way <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> I <b>was</b> {{feared the}} pair of ye was maybe best apart. And that {{brings me to the}} essential: how does your {{business}} speed?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went back}} to his work {{on the other side of}} the river, where his crew was working. He was called home a few weeks later, and he never saw husband or wife again. He learned from Wilber, however, in a short letter <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> much the same as ever.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1981, Benatar's {{video for}} [...] "You Better Run" [...] {{was the second}} clip aired by MTV, after the Buggles song [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star". The Benatar video was {{specifically}} chosen by MTV to echo {{the message to the}} radio industry contained in [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star", <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to change.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Get {{out of the}} car. Don't let it stay here. It may be hit.' These {{words from}} a staff officer give you the first idea <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Up to then {{you might have been}} driving through the black country in the Walsall {{district}} with the population of Aldershot let loose upon its dingy roads. 'Put on this shrapnel helmet. That hat of yours would infuriate the Boche'--this was an unkind allusion to the only uniform which I have a right to wear. 'Take this gas helmet. You won't need it, but it is a standing order. Now come on!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunting, indeed! How should he, when he hadn't a {{horse that}} he could ride upon? And Bob knew nothing of sport. The better for him, seeing the way <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> now. No, he never was out hunting, poor fellow. But for downright innocence and {{kindness}} and gentleness of heart, {{there is no one}} left like him. And now they have murdered him! What is {{to be the end of}} it? There is Persse telling me to hold on by the hounds, when I couldn't keep a hound in the kennels at Ahaseragh if it were ever so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] said Kinsley, with a sigh, [...] "I {{am afraid}} there is. It's very seldom I talk as plainly as this to any, one {{but you are}} just the person one can unburden oneself to a little; and {{to tell you the}} truth, it's rather a relief. As you say, these {{eighteen}} arrests in one week do mean something. Half of the Englishmen who have been arrested are, to my certain knowledge, connected with our Secret Service, and they have been arrested, in many cases, where there are no fortifications worth speaking of within fifty miles, on one pretext or another. The {{fact of the matter is}} <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on in Germany, just at the present moment, the knowledge of which is of vital interest to us." ...|$|E
60|$|Eleanor {{brought the}} spectacles, while {{her father was}} trying, in {{ambiguous}} phrases, {{to explain to her}} too-practical brother-in-law that it might be as well not to say anything about Bold before her, and then retreated. Nothing had been explained to her about Bold and the hospital; but, with a woman's instinct she knew <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> wrong.|$|R
5000|$|... "I couldn’t sleep all night. I felt <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on <b>were</b> hurting my soul, {{the soul}} of my family {{and all of us}} here (...) Now Jews too have behaved like Nazis and my entire being has been shaken." ...|$|R
60|$|Let me by a {{few words}} prove this statement. They will give you, beside, a fresh proof of Sir Charles Lyell's great {{geological}} rule-- {{that the best way}} to explain what we see in ancient rocks is to take for granted, as long as we can do so fairly, <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on then very much as they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> on now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh, Prince Casamassima is {{a veritable}} prince! He {{is a very}} good young man. He is not brilliant, nor witty, but he 'll not let himself be made a fool of. He 's very grave and very devout--though he does propose to marry a Protestant. He will handle that point after marriage. He 's as you see him there: a young man without many ideas, but with a very firm grasp of a single one--the {{conviction}} that Prince Casamassima is a very great person, that he greatly honors any young lady by asking for her hand, and <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> very strangely when the young lady turns her back upon him. The poor young man, I am sure, is profoundly perplexed. But I whisper to him every day, 'Pazienza, Signor Principe!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Mrs. Conway, <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{even better}} than we hoped. The foreman said that from what little talk he had with the servants, he thought {{they had all been}} {{attached}} to Mr. Penfold, and that his sisters were by no means popular among them. He said very often one or other of them would come into the room where they were working and make suggestions, and hunt about themselves {{to see if they could}} find anything. But the best part of it is that one of the carpenters, a steady fellow of twenty-five, took up, as he calls it, with the upper housemaid, and he believes there is a talk about their being married some day. If this is so it would be the very thing for you. You could help him to get married, and the girl could help you to get her place." ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{shall we}} picture John the Baptist to ourselves? Great {{painters}} have exercised their fancy upon his face, his figure, his actions. The best which I can recollect is Guido's--of the magnificent lad {{sitting on the}} rock, half clad in his camel's-hair robe, his stalwart hand lifted up to denounce he hardly knows what, save <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> all wrong, utterly wrong to him--his beautiful mouth open to preach he hardly knows what, save {{that he has a}} message from God, of which he is half conscious as yet--that he is a forerunner, a prophet, a foreteller of something and some one who is to come, and which is very near at hand. The wild rocks are round him, the clear sky over him, and nothing more, [...] . and he, the noble and the priest, has thrown off--not in discontent and desperation (for he was neither democrat nor vulgar demagogue), but in hope and awe--all his family privileges, all that seems to make life worth having; and there aloft and in the mountains, alone with God and Nature, feeding on locusts and wild honey and clothed in skins, he, like Elijah of old, preaches to a generation sunk in covetousness, party spirit, and superstition--preaches what?--The most common--Morality. Ah, wise politician! ah, clear and rational spirit, who knows and tells others to do the duty which lies nearest to them! [...] . who in the hour of his country's deepest degradation had divine courage to say, our deliverance lies, not in rebellion but in doing right.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, {{after two}} failed record deals, {{frustration}} with {{management and the}} general feeling <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> nowhere, Osander and Bevo decided they'd had enough and left the band. They were later replaced by Peter Levin (keyboards), Jason Crosby (keyboards/fiddle) and Aubrey Dayle (percussion). They continued touring with this new lineup until the band collectively reached the decision to finally dissolve itself in 1999.|$|R
60|$|In front {{the battle}} {{had broken out}} again, as furiously as ever; and ere long wounded men began to come down again. They brought cheering news, however. The Prussians were still {{pressing}} forward, the cavalry had thrown the Austrian line into terrible confusion. No one knew exactly where any of the Prussian battalions had got to, but all agreed <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on well.|$|R
2500|$|At an {{internment}} camp after the war, known as [...] "CSDIC Camp 11", the British bugged Dornberger, who {{in conversation with}} Generalmajor Gerhard Bassenge (GOC Air Defences, Tunis & Biserta) {{said that he and}} Wernher von Braun had realized in late 1944 <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> wrong and consequently was in touch with the General Electric Corporation through the German Embassy in Portugal, with a view to coming to some arrangement.|$|R
