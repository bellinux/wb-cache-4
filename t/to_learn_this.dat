25|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{study of}} sleep in small invertebrates is complicated. Insects go through circadian rhythms of activity and passivity but some {{do not seem}} to have a homeostatic sleep need. Insects {{do not seem to}} exhibit REM sleep. However, fruit flies appear to sleep, and systematic disturbance of that state leads to cognitive disabilities. There are several methods of measuring cognitive functions in fruit flies. A common method is to let the flies choose whether they want to fly through a tunnel that leads to a light source, or through a dark tunnel. Normally, flies are attracted to light. But if sugar is placed in the end of the dark tunnel, and something the flies dislike is placed in the end of the light tunnel, the flies will eventually learn to fly towards darkness rather than light. Flies deprived of sleep require a longer time <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> and also forget it more quickly. If an arthropod is experimentally kept awake longer than it is used to, then its coming rest period will be prolonged. In cockroaches that rest period is characterized by the antennae being folded down and by a decreased sensitivity to external stimuli. Sleep has been described in crayfish, too, characterized by passivity and increased thresholds for sensory stimuli as well as changes in the EEG pattern, markedly differing from the patterns found in crayfish when they are awake.|$|E

He sought realism in acting, settings, costumes and movement, if not in content of his plays (although he did write a romantic comedy in the [...] "naturalist" [...] style, as a tribute to Robertson, Sweethearts), shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.|$|E

In this paper, we describe and evaluate an improved version, implemented in a comprehensive user-modeling framework that streamlines the application of the various phases of the modeling process...|$|R

2500|$|Teaching is {{a highly}} {{specialized}} aspect of learning in which the [...] "teacher" [...] (demonstrator) adjusts their behaviour to increase the probability of the [...] "pupil" [...] (observer) achieving the desired end-result of the behaviour. For example, killer whales are known to intentionally beach themselves to catch pinniped prey. Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and encouraging them to attack the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behaviour to help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching. Teaching {{is not limited to}} mammals. Many insects, for example, have been observed demonstrating various forms of teaching to obtain food. Ants, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called [...] "tandem running," [...] in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food. It has been suggested that the pupil ant is able <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>this</b> route to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants.This behaviour of teaching is also exemplified by crows, specifically New Caledonian crows. The adults (whether individual or in families) teach their young adolescent offspring how to construct and utilize tools. For example; Pandanus branches are used to extract insects and other larvae from holes within trees.|$|E

Blampied’s prints were first shown at an exhibition of students’ work in March 1914, where his etching of an ox cart was noted by the correspondent of The Times. [...] The first print believed to have been published was an etching entitled At the wings (illustration removed) which was reproduced in the Annual Report of Bolt Court in 1914. Blampied later recorded his method of working on zinc for etching and copper for drypoint in Ernest Stephen Lumsden's treatise The Art of Etching. Blampied wrote: [...] "I generally chose from amongst my various drawings one which would tend to produce a successful plate. I do not trace on to the copper, but copy a few important lines on to the bare metal with litho-chalk. I then sketch over this with an ordinary sewing needle and rub in a little black oil-colour[...] [...] From the first my efforts are to improve on the sketch until I consider the plate finished[...] [...] In very few cases do I touch a plate after the first proof, so the majority have but one state. If I am dissatisfied with either the composition or details, I prefer to start afresh upon another plate rather than make radical alterations." ...|$|E
