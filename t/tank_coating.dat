40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{geometry of}} free edges on steel structures have a notable {{influence on the}} corrosion protection performance of coating systems. A badly prepared edge, whether thermally or mechanically generated, will be {{a starting point for}} coating deterioration and subsequent steel corrosion. A research program on how edge geometry and coating type affect the corrosion protection performance of organic coatings on edges involved the use of different edge preparation tools and of different coating systems. The investigations included the use of thermal cutting tools, because these {{are an integral part of}} construction lines in modern shipbuilding yards as well as mechanical (milling, grinding) and thermal methods (laser, plasma). Testing methods included the long-term testing of samples in a specially designed ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating</b> test chamber, condensation chamber tests, electric impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and dry film thickness (DFT) measurements on polished cross sections of coated edges. It was found that the edge geometry parameter does not help to control the corrosion protection performance of organic coatings under simulated water ballast tank conditions. Other effects like edge treatment method/tool and coating application are more important. It seems that DFT, or barrier resistance, is not a suitable parameter to control the deterioration of the coating systems, nor does it control their corrosion protection capability. More complex processes, such as combined mechanical, physical, and thermal loads, are responsible for the corrosion protection action of the systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{subsurface}} holographic radar using a multi-frequency signal {{has been}} developed for inspecting dielectric construction materials. The characteristic feature of this device {{is the ability to}} obtain one-sided radar soundings/images with a high sensitivity and high resolution (2 cm) in the frequency band of 3. 6 – 4. 0 GHz. One promising application of the device is non-destructive evaluation of the heat protection system and other materials on the U. S. Space Shuttle, and proposed crewed exploration vehicle (CEV). The advantages of this continuous-wave holographic radar over traditional impulse subsurface radars are discussed and illustrated by experimental results. The disastrous loss of the space shuttle Columbia, as well as even more recent dangerous incidents that were thankfully resolved, have aroused interest in possible new methods and devices for non-destructive testing and evaluation of the Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System, the external fuel tank insulating foam, and other materials and structures on the shuttle (see Figure 1), proposed CEV, and other space vehicles. Voids in or under the external tank insulating foam are considered potential sites for “cryopumping ” where water seeps in and then evaporates explosively at altitude, pulling the foam from the tank (Figure 2). One of the possible means for non-destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation of structural ma-terials is subsurface radar. This method is based on the propensity of electromagnetic waves to be reflected at permittivity contrasts. Up to now, the use of radar for NDT has been hindered by Figure 1 : Suspect flaws on the external hy-drogen <b>tank</b> <b>coating</b> [1].

40|$|This {{research}} paper addresses the biodegradation process for ballast tank coatings in marine environments. As {{part of this}} new approach, a commercially available ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating</b> was exposed to bacteria obtained from a culture collection and to a natural bacterial community isolated from a real ballast tank. The natural community was chosen to explore the interaction of natural biofilms with the coating, an aspect, which is not covered in standard procedures. It is shown that biological activity significantly affects the coating properties. Micro-cracks and holes have been identified using AFM. Acidic bacteria generated holes with 0. 2 - 0. 9 μm in depth and 4 - 9 μm in width. Whereas the natural community additionally caused cracks of 2 - 8 μm in depth and 1 μm in length. The overall effect of this degradation was examined using the EIS technique. However, the bacterial affected coatings (exposed to acid producing bacteria and a natural community) show a decrease in corrosion resistance. Impedance IZI values decreased over time from 1. 18 × 109 to 1. 87 × 107 Ω for acidic bacteria and from 1. 71 × 109 to 2. 24 × 107 Ω for the natural community, indicating a clear loss in coating resistance over time. It is also revealed that the coating corrosion resistance declines after 40 days of exposure for the natural community, leading {{to the formation of}} blisters. Bacterial settling could be linked to some specific biofilm patterns affecting different types of coating attack. It can be concluded {{that it is necessary to}} include natural communities in coating degradation studies to identify possible degradation mechanisms and the severity of the attack over time. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|Failure of {{ballast tank}} {{coatings}} {{is an increasing}} problem in today’s shipping industry. The consequences of coating failures (fracture) are corrosion of the steel {{which can lead to}} early occurrence of fatigue cracks and fast fatigue crack propagation. Inspections of coatings in water ballast tanks of ships have shown that fracture of many coatings occurs earlier than their design life (which is around 8 - 12 years), although the coatings have been maintained regularly and properly. From a financial perspective, maintenance and repair of a coating is very expensive (810 million USD for the US marine shipping industry in 2006) and should be reduced. This can be achieved by better methods that can assist in the identification of critical locations in water ballast tanks regarding coating failure. With such a method, the preparation for maintenance and repair procedures can be made more efficiently. The aim of this thesis is to suggest a method (simulation procedure) which can be used to identify local areas inside a ballast tank where coating fracture may occur as a result of large strains and ageing of the coating’s mechanical properties. The methodology proposed is to use a finite element sub-modelling technique that involves full ship analysis to find local areas which thereafter are refined to better represent ballast tank areas and locations with high strain levels. These areas are then modelled into more detailed local models in order to perform non-linear finite element analyses where the ship steel is allowed to exceed its yield stress in e. g. cut-outs. Fracture of a coating is assumed to occur when the strain level of the ship steel exceeds the fracture strain of the aged coating. Different sea state conditions are simulated where the significant wave height, the wave heading angle and the ship’s speed are varied. Six different local areas are studied in detail with regard to the strain response of the steel (substrate). The computed strains in the substrate are compared against fracture strains of un-aged and aged water ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating</b> samples from uniaxial tensile tests. The results show that the strain in the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of aged coatings in several locations, i. e. the coating will fracture. The most critical areas and locations of the case study vessel are {{at the bottom of the}} ballast tank, in the cut-outs that intersect a longitudinal stiffener and a transverse web frame. It is concluded that the method proposed is suitable for finding local areas where the strain of the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of the coating. It is also concluded that high mesh density in local details is necessary in this method in order to carry out realistic simulations and resolve the strain gradients in cut-out details and thereby be able to compare strains in the substrate with coating fracture strains...|$|E
40|$|Microbiologically {{influenced}} corrosion (MIC) {{is known}} to be a dangerous process in ship tanks due to its rapid and yet unpredictable occurrence, leading to extremely fast local corrosion, possibly jeopardizing the structural integrity, in a relatively short time. This project focuses on a fundamental understanding of MIC processes in ship ballast tanks (SBTs) as a basis for the development of effective counterstrategies that offer an appropriate protection against MIC attack. Local conditions typically consist of oxic-anoxic environments where both aerobic and anaerobic biofilms develop resulting in aggressive corrosion. Fundamental understanding of the dominant parameters considering material, environment and microbes were addressed. In chapter 1 a review of the conditions in ship ballast tanks, possible MIC mechanisms and practical counterstrategies is presented. Chapter two deals with the impact of MIC in a real scale SBT to understand community characteristics within SBTs. The study highlights the impact of attached biofilms on local corrosion in a ship ballast tank environment. The application of molecular techniques in combination with electrochemical techniques provides a better and synergistic monitoring tool in the enclosed seawater environment. The work in this chapter provides a systematic future research and analysis approach to build up a database of bacterial species, which are involved in corrosion or coating degradation on-board of ships. A more effective treatment system for treating biofilms on sidewalls of ship ballast tanks will help to reduce costly material replacements. In chapter three the usability of electrochemical techniques for monitoring MIC is discussed in detail. Three individual approaches were studied in the lab comprising: (i) corrosion impact of a dual species biofilm, (ii) implementation of a simulated ship tank model system and (iii) the study of the biodeterioration of a ship ballast <b>tank</b> <b>coating.</b> The fourth chapter comprises different highly sensitive and spatially resolved techniques to study MIC on a very local scale. The first step included the development of a novel analysis approach for the preparation and visualization of metal surfaces, suitable for combined imaging by epifluorescent microscopy (EFM), AFM and SEM. By combining three different microscopes, the complementary use of these high-resolution techniques to study surface changes and accumulation of biological substances on stainless steel surfaces was proven. The last experimental part of the thesis covers the use of local electrochemical techniques. The scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) and scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) were used for their high spatial resolution close to the metal/solution interface. By combing these techniques in-situ changes at metal/solution interfaces in the presence and absence of aerobic bacteria could be followed up. Therefore it was possible to demonstrate that the application of local scanning electrochemical techniques with high-spatial resolution is a powerful tool for a better understanding of microbial activity on metal systems providing in-situ information of the processes taking place at the metal/biofilm/solution interface. Chapter five summarises the conclusions drawn in the preceding chapters. In addition, the general discussion in this chapter links together some of the preceding results and suggestions. The last part of the thesis gives a future outlook on MIC monitoring and prediction and reviews options to mitigate MIC failures based on a multidimensional approach.

[...] The methods used to avoid having these invasive species surviving in ballast tanks however greatly increased the rate of corrosion. Therefore ongoing research attempts to find water treatment systems that kill invasive species, while not having a destructive effect on the ballast tank coatings. As double-hulled tankers were introduced it meant that there was more ballast tank area had to be coated and therefore a greater capital investment for ship owners.

50|$|The type of tank used to melt solder and tar is very {{different}} from one that is used to melt waxes, especially organic waxes such as soy, for making scented and colored candles. For example, tanks used for adhesives may need to heat up to 500degrees(°) Fahrenheit(F), while an organic soy wax will be ruined at over 140°F and should never be heated above 200°F. A delicate soy wax used to make candles would be burned and destroyed if not heated in an even, lower temperature than solder or tar. Also, since soaps and candles are scented and colored, the tanks designed for melting these substances need to be specially polished so there is no cross-contamination between different scents of candles or soaps.

Although Tachikawa Hikoki successfully managed to enter into large-scale production of the Ki-43, the 1st Army Air Arsenal was less successful - hampered by a shortage of skilled workers, it was ordered to stop production after 49 Ki-43s were built. Nakajima eventually ceased production in mid-1944 in favor of the Ki-84, but the Tachikawa Hikoki continued to produce the Ki-43.|$|R
40|$|The instabilities {{that occur}} in the {{pressure-driven}} extrusion of molten polymers are fascinating from the scientific perspective but troublesome and sometimes catastrophic from the industrial one. Flow anomalies like sharkskin, Stick-Slip and Gross Melt fracture can occur in common extrusion operations such as the manufacture of polymeric rods, tubes, sheets, films, <b>tanks</b> or wire <b>coating.</b> Over the years, processors have learned to work around these processing defects by a variety of means: slowing the manufacturing rate, increasing the melt temperature or by- addition of processing additives. All these solutions can be proven extremely costly, thus a significant interest and effort is put in designing and manufacturing polymers with better processing-properties and lower potential to flow-instabilities. Sharkskin, here defined as periodic surface distortions of low amplitude and high frequency, is most commonly observed in polyethylene’s of sufficiently narrow molecular weight. One reason why sharkskin is of great importance is that as the extrusion flow rate increases, it is in many cases the first instability to occur, it is challenging to suppress and affects an important product quality parameter, namely the surface appearance. FT Rheology can be used to study different PE industrial samples with respect to their behavior under the LAOS flow. The resulting non-linearities showed a dependency on both the molecular weight and topology [1]. Filipe et al. [1] found out that for strain amplitudes above a critical value, the stress time signal exhibited an amplitude decay that indicates slip in qualitative agreement with Chen et al. [2] and Hatzikiriakos and Dealy [3]. The second harmonic was thus found to become significant (above noise level) {{at the onset of the}} stress amplitude decay and it is found to be a useful indicator of secondary flows or generally instabilities.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi {{investigar}} os fatores que inibem o uso de Técnicas Ambientais nos Postos de Combustíveis da cidade de Natal/RN. Para isso, foi utilizado um procedimento de pesquisa do tipo Survey (levantamento) com o auxílio de um questionário, identificado como sendo o instrumento de pesquisa. Utilizou-se a amostra por conveniência, não probabilístico. Para coleta dos dados, utilizou-se a aplicação do questionário diretamente aos Gerentes ou Sub-gerentes dos Postos, de acordo com a sua disponibilidade ou presença. Os dados foram coletados em todas as regiões de Natal (Norte, Sul, Leste e Oeste). A população de acordo com os dados da ANP de Setembro 2005 é de 111 postos (atualizados) e a amostra coletada foi de 86. Para realizar a análise dos dados desta pesquisa foram utilizados os softwares Excel e Statistica versão 5. 0, para Windows. A análise de dados é dividida em duas partes: análise descritiva e análise de agrupamentos (clusters). Os resultados mostraram que maior parte dos entrevistados têm entre 30 e 39 anos de idade; têm 2 º grau completo; declararam ter entre pouco e razoável conhecimento quanto ao uso de TL em postos de combustível; e uma pequena parte dos entrevistados informaram ter muito conhecimento quanto as resoluções do CONAMA estabelecidas para os Postos de combustível. Dos postos pesquisados, a maioria é nacional (76, 7 %); as práticas ambientalmente corretas mais usadas nos postos são: coleta seletiva de óleo usado ou contaminado e tanques ecológicos - revestidos com fibra de vidro reforçada; grande parte dos entrevistados (33, 8 %) informou que nunca fazem planejamento de ação futura referente a TL; cerca de mais da metade dos entrevistados (84, 9 %) declararam que os seus funcionários têm de nenhum a um razoável nível de treinamento para lidarem com problemas que comprometem o meio ambiente; a maioria dos postos (72, 1 %) funcionam há mais de 6 anos. Observa-se que quase todos os entrevistados (96, 5 %) avaliam como sendo importante ou muito importante a implantação de TL em Postos de combustível e a grande maioria (82, 1 %) avalia a dificuldade em se implantar essas tecnologias em postos como sendo fácil ou muito fácil. Na análise de cluster, verificou-se a existência de dois agrupamentos (tantos nas variáveis das barreiras e benefícios), sendo que dentro de cada clusters existe homogeneidade e entre clusters existe heterogeneidade. Na verdade, tudo é importante ou muito importante na opinião dos entrevistados. Existe apenas uma pequena diferença significativa que os separa em clustersThe {{objective of}} this work {{was to investigate the}} factors that inhibit the use of Environmental Techniques in the Gas Station of the city of Natal/RN. For this, a survey {{with the aid of a}} questionnaire was used like research instrument. It s used a sample for convenience, not probabilistic. For collection of the data, it was used directly application of the questionnaire to the Managers or Assistant managers of the gas station, in accordance with its availability or presence. The data was collected in all the regions of Natal (North, South, East and West). The population in accordance with the data of the ANP of September 2005 is of 111 ranks and the collected sample was of 86. To carry through the analysis of the data of this research had been used softwares Excel and Statistic version 5. 0, for Windows. The analysis of data is divided in two parts; descriptive analysis and analysis of groupings (clusters). The results showed that bigger part of the interviewed ones has between 30 and 39 years of age; they have second grade completed; they had declared to have little between and reasonable knowledge how much to the use of Clean Technology (CT) in gas station; and a small part of the interviewed ones had informed to have much knowledge how much the resolutions of the CONAMA established for the Gas Station. Of the searched ranks, the majority is national(76. 7 %); the most accurate practice environmental used in the gas station are: it collects selective of oil used or contaminated and ecological <b>tanks</b> - <b>coated</b> with strengthened fibre glass; great part of the interviewed ones (33. 8 %) informed that never the TL makes planning of referring future action; about of the half of the interviewed ones (84. 9 %) they had more declared that its employees have of none to a reasonable level of training for deal with problems that compromise the environment; the majority of the ranks (72. 1 %) functions has for more then six years. It is observed that almost all the interviewed ones (96. 5 %) evaluate as being important or very important the implantation of CT in Gas Station and the great majority (82. 1 %) evaluates the difficulty in if implanting these technologies in Gas Station as being easy or very easy. In the analysis of cluster, it was verified existence of two groupings (as much in the variable of the barriers and benefits), being that inside of each clusters exists homogeneity and between clusters exists heterogeneity. In reality, everything is important or very important in the opinion of the interviewed ones. There only exists a small significant difference that separates them in cluster...|$|R
40|$|Industrialized {{society is}} linked to the {{transport}} of hazardous materials by road and rail, among other. During transportation, accidents may occur and propagate among the tankers leading to severe fires, explosion or toxic dispersions. This may increase the level of individual and social risk associated to those activities, since the transport network often crosses densely populated area. The escalation of a primary event, in this case the fire, is typically denoted as domino effect, and the triggered secondary events typically are amplified. In the framework of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) transportation, severe fire and explosion hazards are associated to the possible catastrophic rupture of tankers, which may be induced by domino effect of accidental fires. Heat resistant coatings may protected tankers against the fire, reducing the heat load that reaches the tank shell wall and the lading. Indeed, the rupture {{is the result of the}} double effect of thermal weakening of the tank material and the increasing pressure due to LPG evaporation. However, this protection systems are not ideal and undergo defects due to both material degradation and accidental damage. Therefore, protection may be ineffective. The present work is aimed at characterizing the performance of defective coatings. The first part of the work is devoted to the characterization of past accidents occurred in the framework of road and rail transportation of hazardous materials. The ARIA and MHIDAS databases are adopted as data sources, identifying 245 road and 220 rail accidents involving hazardous materials. The analysis highlighted the importance of protecting tank from heat load to avoid the rupture and related severe scenario. For these reasons, in North America the installation of a heat resistant coating is used to protect dangerous good tankers from accidental fire exposure. In Europe, ADR and RID regulations govern transnational transport of hazardous materials by road and by rail, respectively, and still not include any section about thermal protection systems of tankers. Possible concerns related to the installation of these systems is due presence of defects that may be formed accidentally in the fireproofing layer. It is therefore important to establish what level of defect is acceptable in order to avoid the failure of tankers, in the prospective of a wider implementation of tankers fire protections in the European framework. Since large scale bonfire tests are expensive and difficult to be carried out in order to verify the thermal protections adopted, modelling the behaviour of pressurized insulated tankers when exposed to the fire is a possible solution to test the adequateness of defective protections. In order to describe the thermal behaviour of real scale LPG tanks exposed to fire, a lumped model (namely, ‘RADMOD’) and a Finite Elements Model (FEM) are developed. The models are validated against available experimental data and allow predicting the thermal behaviour of tankers with defective coating when exposed to fire, with the aim to assess the thermal protection performance. The phenomena taking place through the vessel in presence of defects are investigated and characterized, in order to reproduce the experimental data on thermal behaviour of defective thermal protection systems exposed to fire. The FEM model allows to determine the wall temperature profile and the stress distribution over the vessel, determining, in the end, a critical defect size that lead to the tank failure, with respect different fire conditions. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the FEM model in order to identify the parameters that mostly affect the heat exchanges of the system. This analysis highlights the main relevance of the flame temperature against other parameters, such as convective heat transfer coefficients and emissivity of flame and steel. The complex analysis performed by FEM model, requires high computational times, which may be prohibitive when a wide number of runs is required. The RADMOD code is a simplified lumped model, which allows to assess the behaviour, among other, of the pressure and the fluid temperature with lower, and thus acceptable, computational time. Another plus of the RADMOD model is that it can be run for a wide range of materials, substances, geometries and fire scenario, estimating a conservative but credible time to failure of the tank. The novel mathematical code for defective thermal protection system is added to the previous version of the RADMOD model, which was implemented for unprotected or completely <b>coated</b> <b>tanks,</b> thus all the phenomena related to the defect enclosure are characterised. In addition, other phenomena, already present in the RADMOD model, are revised to enhance the potentiality of the code. The comparison of results with available experimental data on medium-scale shows that the model proposed in this thesis work can reasonably predict the thermal response. The application of the modelling tool to different geometries is performed considering real-scale defects. Thus, several case-studies were defined in order to reproduce medium- and large-scale tanks varying a few parameters, such as defect size and liquid filling level, for testing the reproducibility of the new model. The results from the case studies highlight the potentiality and the flexibility of the RADMOD code in modelling the thermal response. The ultimate goal would be to apply the data collected from RADMOD code about temperature and pressure of lading, as boundary condition in the FEM model for an improved modelling of thermal behaviour of real-scale LPG tanks in fire scenarios even if there is a defective thermal protection system...|$|R
