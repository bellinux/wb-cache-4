5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover. The street was <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey dashed up the North Korean coast raiding {{transportation}} facilities from 1 to 6 November. She struck at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, Iowon, Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly <b>torn</b> <b>up,</b> and many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong {{and near the}} Chang-San-Got Peninsula 11 and 13 November, New Jersey completed her first {{tour of duty in}} Korea.|$|E

60|$|He stumped away, but on {{his return}} {{preferred}} to let Kate carry the soiled, <b>torn</b> envelope <b>up</b> to the young folks. The letter had palpably been tampered with. It had been opened and doubtless read, and the flap clumsily glued down again.|$|R
5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|NC98 Bus. {{was first}} created running along Wait Avenue through Downtown and met NC98 at the US1A roundabout. This was a {{renumbering}} of NC98 {{as the first}} sections of the Wake Forest bypass were put into place. As NC98 was expanded to US1, NC98 Bus. expanded to cover all of the previous NC98 routing east of US1 and west of Jones Dairy Road. In September 2010 the third segment of NC98 was opened from US1 to Thompson Mill Road with the old routing between Thompson Mill Road and Fawn Drive being <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> and replaced with new routing which became NC98 Business.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was in such}} a state of disrepair by the 1980s that it was almost demolished, and the nearby tracks were <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> and sold for scrap by 1984. However, the station avoided demolition and was renovated in 1988. It was used as a real estate office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. In 1999, the station became an Italian restaurant and received its current name, La Stazione. The {{building was}} expanded in 2003 and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 mob film.|$|E
60|$|Norman of <b>Torn</b> looked <b>up</b> in unfeigned surprise, {{and then}} there {{came back to him}} the scene in the Queen's {{apartment}} the night before. It was all a sore perplexity to him; he could not fathom it, nor did he attempt to.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{knew where}} that letter was, for having seen {{it on her}} desk he had, without reading it, <b>torn</b> it <b>up</b> and thrown it into the waste-paper basket, {{thinking}} the less that remained to remind her of the young philosopher the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "you needn't have <b>torn</b> 'em <b>up</b> on my account. I {{travel on}} the pass which the Northeastern gives me as a legislator, and I'm {{thinking}} seriously of getting Mr. Flint {{to send me}} an annual, now that I'm in politics and have to cover the State." ...|$|R
5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> {{on the old}} main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} Chicago were mostly shot on location, as Bay {{believed}} the plates had {{to really be}} shot in the actual city. Farrar was always fascinated {{with the idea of}} shooting on location, and then blending the film with computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team used aerial plates of the city's actual buildings and added destruction elements such as smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, and <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> streets. Four ILM employees also travelled to Chicago and photographed buildings from top to bottom at six different times of the day {{in order to create a}} digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes. ILM's crew designed many major action scenes, with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.|$|E
5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E

60|$|His {{attitude}} therefore {{was much}} the same toward women as it was toward men, except that he had sworn always to protect them. Possibly, in a way, he looked up to womankind, {{if it could be}} said that Norman of <b>Torn</b> looked <b>up</b> to anything: God, man or devil--it being more his way to look down upon all creatures whom he took the trouble to notice at all.|$|R

5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them {{that only the}} thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> by the creature at the river.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E

2500|$|The 972 manuscripts {{found at}} Qumran were found {{primarily}} {{in two separate}} formats: [...] as scrolls and as fragments of previous scrolls and texts. [...] In the fourth cave the fragments were <b>torn</b> into <b>up</b> to 15,000 pieces. These small fragments created somewhat of a problem for scholars. G.L. Harding, director of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, began working on piecing the fragments together and after forty years of work he was still not finished.|$|R

25|$|In {{the last}} year {{before the end of}} the war, the Confederate {{railroad}} system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} new {{extensions}} and branches were built under his ownership. The New York and Long Beach Railroad opened in 1880, from Lynbrook south to Long Beach, and it was operated by the LIRR. The Long Beach Marine Railway built a line on Long Beach to Point Lookout in 1881 and was bought by the LIRR in 1886, only to be <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> in 1895.|$|E
25|$|An {{outbreak}} of diphtheria in Jersey quickly {{led to the}} island running out of antitoxin, it was contained by isolation and bans on public gatherings. Medical supplies where possible, were made locally, bandages made from <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> sheets, moss was an alternative for cotton wool, with some medicines sourced from France. A few supplies, such as insulin, came through after 1942 from the Red Cross, but too late for 30 patients in Jersey.|$|E

25|$|All {{nine of the}} {{previously}} known Uranian rings were studied by the instruments of Voyager 2. These measurements showed that the Uranian rings are distinctly different from those at Jupiter and Saturn. The Uranian ring system might be relatively young, {{and it did not}} form {{at the same time that}} Uranus did. The particles that make up the rings might be the remnants of a moon that was broken up by either a high-velocity impact or <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> by tidal effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{next two}} stops, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, are roughly eight miles (13km) apart, the longest {{distance}} between any two {{stops on the}} Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era {{that had not yet}} been <b>torn</b> <b>up</b> were renovated and the line was extended to Tenmile River and its new northern terminus, Wassaic. A small yard where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.|$|E
