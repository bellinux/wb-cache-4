5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
25|$|In severe or {{untreated}} cases, <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> may perforate, {{allowing the}} pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, {{it is almost}} always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of acute otitis media in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.|$|E

25|$|The tensor tympani acts {{to dampen}} the noise {{produced}} by chewing. When tensed, the muscle pulls the malleus medially, tensing <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and damping vibration {{in the ear}} ossicles and thereby reducing the perceived amplitude of sounds.|$|E
25|$|An {{option for}} severe {{acute otitis media}} in which analgesics are not {{controlling}} ear pain is to perform a tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} ear, {{the energy of}} {{pressure}} waves is translated into mechanical vibrations by the three auditory ossicles. Pressure waves move <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> which in turns moves the malleus, the first bone of the middle ear. The malleus articulates to incus which connects to the stapes. The footplate of the stapes connects to the oval window, {{the beginning of the}} inner ear. When the stapes presses on the oval window, it causes the perilymph, the liquid of the inner ear to move. The middle ear thus serves to convert the energy from sound pressure waves to a force upon the perilymph of the inner ear. The oval window has only approximately 1/18 the area of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and thus produces a higher pressure. The cochlea propagates these mechanical signals as waves in the fluid and membranes, and then converts them to nerve impulses which are transmitted to the brain.|$|E

50|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear, which consists of the auricle (also pinna) and the ear canal. It gathers sound energy and focuses it on <b>the</b> eardrum (<b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane).</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{hearing loss}} is mainly due to fluid {{in the middle}} ear or rupture of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Prolonged {{duration}} of otitis media is associated with ossicular complications and, together with persistent tympanic membrane perforation, contributes to {{the severity of the}} disease and hearing loss. When a cholesteatoma or granulation tissue is present in the middle ear, the degree of hearing loss and ossicular destruction is even greater.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM {{is related to}} {{childhood}} anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who have}} Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging or a lack of movement of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> from a puff of air. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|The stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E

There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. <b>The</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This {{preservation}} allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

[...] Additionally, other {{names for the}} daouli, {{depending}} on the area, include toumpano, tymbano, or toumbi, which stem from the ancient Greek word tympano; this word exists in English in the word tympani for the drum section in the modern classical orchestra and <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> for the eardrum.|$|E
2500|$|Motorcycle {{and other}} power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal {{to do so}} to avoid {{excessive}} road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and intercom speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,Pa (...) Standard atmospheric pressure is 101,325Pa. 2 x 10−5 / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10−9, a ratio of less than a billionth. hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and {{this leads to a}} small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the acoustic reflex).|$|E

2500|$|The tympanic reflex {{helps prevent}} {{damage to the}} inner ear by {{muffling}} the transmission of vibrations from <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to the oval window. [...] The reflex has a response time of 40 milliseconds, not fast enough to protect the ear from sudden loud noises such as an explosion or gunshot. [...] Thus, the reflex most likely developed to protect early humans from loud thunder claps which do not happen in a split second. [...] The reflex works by contracting {{the muscles of the}} inner ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius. [...] This pulls the manubrium of the malleus inwards and tightens it. This tightening prevents the vibrations from disturbing the perilymph. Withdrawal from drugs such as benzodiazepines had been known to cause tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS) during withdrawal. The tympanic reflex will also activate when loud vibrations are generated by the person themselves. The tensor tympani can often be observed vibrating while shouting at an increased volume, dampening the sound somewhat.|$|E
2500|$|For solids and liquids like bone, {{muscle and}} blood, this added {{pressure}} {{is not much}} of a problem; but it is a problem for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, paranasal sinuses and lungs. This is because the air in those spaces reduces in volume when under pressure and so does not provide those spaces with support against the higher outside pressure. Even at a depth of [...] underwater, an inability to equalize air pressure in the middle ear with outside water pressure can cause pain, and <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> (eardrum) can rupture at depths under 10ft (3 m). The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10m (33ft) is 100% (100 kPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30m (100ft) to 40m (130ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).|$|E
2500|$|The horse's {{respiratory}} system {{consists of the}} nostrils, pharynx, larynx, trachea, diaphragm, and lungs. Additionally, the nasolacrimal duct and sinuses {{are connected to the}} nasal passage. The horse's {{respiratory system}} not only allows the animal to breathe, but also is important in the horse's sense of smell (olfactory ability) as well as in communicating. [...] The soft palate blocks off the pharynx from the mouth (oral cavity) of the horse, except when swallowing. This helps prevent the horse from inhaling food, but also means that a horse cannot use its mouth to breathe when in respiratory distress—a horse can only breathe through its nostrils, also called obligate nasal breathing. [...] For this same reason, horses also cannot pant as a method of thermoregulation. [...] The genus Equus also has a unique part of the respiratory system called the guttural pouch, which is thought to equalize air pressure on <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Located between the mandibles but below the occiput, it fills with air when the horse swallows or exhales.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{how much the}} method of observation agrees with a standardised review of evidence of clinical examination, {{for the assessment of}} clinical otoscopic competence. Methods: 65 medical students took part in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) station using patients with real pathology. Examiners assessed otoscopic competency in <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> examination solely by distant observation. An external examiner later reviewed candidates’ documented findings on a schematic drawing of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes.</b> Observed agreement of the two methods and Cohen’s kappa coefficient were calculated. Results: Mean otoscopy scores for examiner 1 and examiner 2 were 67. 7 % and 29. 4 % respectively. There was a significant difference using the Mann-Whitney U-test. OSCE observation declared 47. 7 % of candidates (31 / 65) to be clinically competent. Drawing-based analysis however deemed only 4. 6 % (3 / 65) to have achieved this competency. This represented more than a ten-fold overestimation of clinical competency by OSCE assessment. Observed agreement between assessment methods was 59. 6 %. Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 0. 1. Conclusions: OSCE observational assessment of otoscopic clinical competency correlates poorly with review of evidence from clinical examination. If evidence review is acceptable as a better marker for competency, observation should not to be used alone in OSCE assessment. Evidence review itself is vulnerable to candidate guesswork. OSCE could possibly explore candidate demonstration with explanation of findings, by use of digital otoscopy offering a shared view of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membranes,</b> as an improved standard of clinical competency assessment.

6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and external auditory meatus (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane,</b> separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the sound vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> to the endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E
