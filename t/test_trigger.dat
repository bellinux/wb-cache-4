40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{model for a}} timer-driven {{triggering}} and alerting system. Such a system {{can be used with}} relational and object-relational databases systems. Timer-driven trigger systems have a number of advantages over traditional trigger systems that <b>test</b> <b>trigger</b> conditions and run trigger actions in response to update events. They are relatively easy to implement since they can be built using a middleware program that simply runs SQL statements against a DBMS. Also, they can check certain types of conditions, such as "a value did not change" or "a value did not change by more than 10 % in six months. " Such conditions may be of interest for a particular application, but cannot be checked correctly by an event-driven trigger system. Also, users may be perfectly happy being notified once a day, once a week, or even less often of certain conditions, depending on their application. Timer triggers are appropriate for these users. The semantics of timer triggers are [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A (build) target {{specifies}} {{the information}} {{that is needed to}} automatically build a software artifact. Managing the de-pendencies between the targets of a large code base is chal-lenging. This paper focuses on underutilized targets—an im-portant dependency problem that we identified at Google. An underutilized target is one with files not needed by some of its dependents. Underutilized targets result in less mod-ular code, overly large artifacts, slow builds, and unneces-sary build and test triggers. To mitigate these problems, programmers decompose underutilized targets into smaller targets. However, manually decomposing a target is tedious and error-prone. Although we prove that finding the best target decomposition is NP-hard, we introduce a greedy algo-rithm that proposes a decomposition through iterative uni-fication of the strongly connected components of the target. Our tool found 19, 994 decomposable targets in a set of 40, 000 Java library targets at Google. A decomposable target is one that can be decomposed to at least two targets. Our tool found that decomposing any of the 5, 129 decomposable tar-gets would save at least one build or <b>test</b> <b>trigger.</b> The eval-uation results show that our tool is (1) efficient because on average, it analyzes a target in two minutes and (2) effective because for each of 1, 010 targets, it would save more than 50 % of the total execution time of the tests triggered by the target. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purposes: Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the synchronization of different ventilators with spontaneous breathing under non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) delivered by helmet interface to the diseased lung. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate ventilator synchronization under pathological conditions by testing the difference of trigger sensitivity between an ordinary ICU ventilator and an NPPV ventilator which are used in our intensive care unit. Methods: A simulator was used to set three lung conditions: (1) normal: compliance (C) of 50 mL/cmH 2 O and airway resistance (R) of 5 cmH 2 O/L/sec; (2) obstructive: C 50, R 20; and (3) restrictive: C 20, R 5, respectively. To <b>test</b> <b>trigger</b> sensitivity, pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode and spontaneous/time (S/T) mode were selected for the ordinary and NPPV ventilators. We tested multiple positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP; 5, 10, 15 cmH 2 O) and pressure support (PS; 5, 10, 15 cmH 2 O) settings, and recorded the inspiratory and expiratory trigger delays under each lung condition. Results: With an ordinary ICU ventilator, neither inspiratory nor expiratory trigger delays were significantly affected by PEEP or PS under any lung conditions. In contrast, with an NPPV ventilator, auto-triggers were frequently recorded for some combinations of PS and lung conditions at 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP; inspiratory trigger delays worsened at peak inspiratory pressures ≥ 25 cmH 2 O, and under obstructive conditions, expiratory trigger delays were prolonged in accordance with increasing PS. Conclusions: An ordinary ICU ventilator is superior to an NPPV ventilator in achieving synchronization with spontaneous breathing, especially under obstructive condition and with combination of low PEEP and high PS. We consider that an ordinary ventilator is better choice for such situation than an NPPV ventilator...|$|E

We characterised the personality of seabass with the commonly used restraint and open field tests and assessed the link between personality traits and individual triggering activity towards the self-feeder apparatus.
