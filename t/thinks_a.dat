5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E

500|$|Holloway {{highlighted}} Michael's {{review of}} Angela, wherein {{he tells her}} [...] "You're adequate", as the best line in the episode. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the quotes for the episode. The site ranked Angela's monologue about how much she loves being judged, as well as Jim's revelation that Dwight <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> Thursday is really a Friday, a four out of five. TV Fanatic awarded the conversation between Stanley and Michael—wherein Stanley tells Michael how to properly listen for subtext in a voicemail—as well as Dwight's frustration that {{he went out and}} got drunk with his laser tag team, a five out of five.

He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of a blue-collar kind of guy who doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} BWV 51 {{during a}} period when he composed church cantatas only irregularly, {{some of them to}} complete his earlier cycles. According to the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff, Bach may have written the cantata shortly before 1730 for an unknown occasion. The performance material survived but does not reveal further detail, other than indicating one later performance. Hofmann sees a connection to the court of Weißenfels where a scoring of solo soprano and trumpet was popular, and assumes that the work may have been originally intended for a performance at court by a professional female singer. Bach had written two birthday cantatas for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. He was invited to the birthday celebration of 1729 and returned with the title of [...] ("court director of music of Saxe-Weissenfels"), and Hofmann <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> connection between the title and cantata [...] "highly probable".|$|E

500|$|Polly Shulman of The New York Times finds Quicksilver hard {{to follow}} and amazingly complex {{but a good}} read. However she notes that the {{complicated}} and clunky dialogue between the characters is a distraction. [...] She <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> full appreciation {{of the work is}} only possible {{within the context of the}} remaining novels of The Baroque Cycle, and compares the novel to works by Dorothy Dunnett, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, calling it [...] "history-of-science fiction". In the post-publication review for The New York Times, Edward Rothstein remarks that the scope of the novel is at times detrimental: [...] "Unfortunately, in this novelistic cauldron it can sometimes seem as if mercury's vapors had overtaken the author himself, as if every detail he had learned had to be anxiously crammed into his text, while still leaving the boundaries between fact and invention ambiguous". He considers the novel to be an [...] "experiment in progress", although the historical background is compelling.|$|E
500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{desires to}} have a baby, but her {{adoption}} process is taking a long time. She begins to act [...] "baby-crazy" [...] when she is around little children. While outside of 30 Rock, Liz pats a boy {{in front of her}} [...] on the head, only to discover {{that it is not a}} child but a dwarf man, Stewart LaGrange (Peter Dinklage). To cover up, Liz lies to Stewart, telling him that the reason she pat his head was to get his attention, which he accepts and the two go on a date. During their date, Liz tries to pick Stewart up to stop him from touching fire. Stewart asks Liz if she first thought he was a child when they first met, [...] and she admits this is true, displeasing him. The next day, she calls him to apologize and asks that he give her a second chance and meet her at the Brooklyn Bridge. At the bridge, however, Liz mistakenly <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> boy is Stewart, which prompts him to realize this will never work between them.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, Clark {{is forced}} to find all three stones, which results in the {{creation}} of the Fortress of Solitude in the season five premiere. There, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to begin his training in order to complete his destiny, but Clark interrupts the training to go back to Smallville, which forces Jor-El to strip Clark of his powers. When Clark is killed in his mortal body in season five's [...] "Hidden", Jor-El resurrects Clark with his powers; as a result, Jonathan's life is traded for Clark's in the episode [...] "Reckoning". Clark's consistent disobedience forces Jor-El to imprison his son in a block of ice in the season seven episode [...] "Blue", but after learning a clone of Clark has returned to Smallville in [...] "Persona", Jor-El frees his son so he can take care of the creature. When Clark <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> world without him would be better, Jor-El sends Clark to an alternate reality to show him the world would be worse if he did not exist in it. By the start of season nine, Jor-El begins fully training Clark for his ultimate destiny. As part of that training, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to tune his Kryptonian intuition. To do so, Jor-El gives Clark the ability to read people's thoughts, only to take it away at an important moment and force Clark to apply what he has learned about human behavior. A clone of Jor-El is released on Earth in the episode [...] "Kandor", but he is murdered before he can fully reunite with Clark and is only able to share a single moment with his son before dying.|$|E

500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because {{it would be useful to}} them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. We may not be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and <b>thinks</b> <b>a</b> surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E
