However, elucidating these interactions and their underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging since both host and pathogen need to be fully genetically accessible organisms.

We provide a complete toolset, including an annotated fungal genome and methods for genetic manipulation of the fungus and its host plant. This toolset will enable researchers to easily study biotrophic interactions at the molecular level on both the pathogen and the host side. Moreover, our research on the fungal life cycle revealed a mating <b>type</b> <b>bias</b> phenomenon. U. bromivora harbors a haplo-lethal allele that is linked to one mating type region.

Classically, analysis of cytokine expression patterns has been performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for each separate analyte. A new technology, Luminex MAP ®, facilitates the simultaneous evaluation of multiple immune mediators with advantages of higher throughput, smaller sample volume, and lower cost. Validation of this technology has been limited to small sample sets, limited use of clinical study specimens, and use of non-commercial reagents. Methods: Ninety-six specimens from women over the course of their respective pregnancies were evaluated for cytokine concentrations using commercially available ELISA kits and commercially available Luminex MAP ® kits according to the manufacturers' directions. Correlations between data sets were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results: Excellent correlations were demonstrated for IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 10, IFN γ, and TNF α, in contrast to IL- 12 p 70 and IL- 13. Conclusions: Luminex multiplex technology has distinct advantages and is a valid alternative method to ELISA for the evaluation of the majority of cytokines tested and for the characterization of immune system status. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The findings of this research suggest that while significant diversity is still evident, there is a bias in the Myers‐Briggs personality profiles of accounting students towards preferences for sensation over intuition, thinking over feeling, and judgment over perception. Research in psychology and education has shown that different Myers‐Briggs personality preferences are associated with significant differences in how people prefer to learn, and the types of learning experiences under which they perform best, that is personality types are associated with distinct learning styles. These outcomes suggest that accounting educators should cater to the variety of personality types among their students by adopting a diversified teaching approach. Such an approach should provide a balance of learning experiences and teaching strategies by attempting to challenge the weaknesses of the personality bias of accounting students in the intuition, feeling and perception areas, and building upon their strengths in the sensation, thinking and judgment areas...|$|E
40|$|Maps of the {{peculiar}} velocity field derived from distance relations {{are affected by}} Malmquist <b>type</b> <b>bias</b> and selection effects. Because of {{the large number of}} interdependent effects, they are in most cases difficult to treat analytically. Monte Carlo simulations are used to understand and evaluate these effects. In these simulations the "true" spatial distribution and relevant properties of galaxies as well as selection effects and observational uncertainties are realistically modeled. The results of the simulation can directly be applied to correct observed peculiar velocity maps. The simulation is used to investigate biases in samples of measured peculiar velocities by Lynden-Bell et al. (1988), Willick (1990) and the new sample of spiral galaxies by Haynes et al. (1993). Based on the results obtained from the application of our method to toy models we find that the method is a useful tool to estimate the bias induced both by inhomogeneities and selection effects. This is a crucial step for the analysis of the Haynes sample which was selected with a redshift dependent criterion.

Accordingly, these traits {{may influence the}} multiplicity of infection (MOI) of Plasmodium falciparum {{and the presence of}} distinct parasite genotypes. In 840 febrile children in northern Ghana, we typed the P. falciparum merozoite surface protein genes (msp 1, msp 2) and examined effects of the Hb variants on MOI and parasite diversity. HbAC, HbAS, heterozygous, and homozygous alpha(+) -thalassaemia occurred in 21, 5, 29 and 4 % of the children, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum was detected in 95 %. The haemoglobinopathies did not influence MOI, nor did the Hb <b>type</b> <b>bias</b> the distribution of the msp allelic families. However, IC type parasites were most common among patients with homozygous alpha(+) -thalassaemia (93 %), less frequent in heterozygotes (89 %), and least frequent in alpha-globin normal children (84 %, P(chi 2 trend) = 0. 03). The opposite was seen for Mad 20 type parasites (34 %, 47 %, 53 %, P(chi 2 trend) = 0. 02). Only a few of the 72 individual msp alleles were selected by the haemoglobinopathies. HbC and alpha(+) -thalassaemia are frequent in northern Ghana. In symptomatic children, the effect of Hb variants on parasite multiplicity and diversity appears to be limited.

40|$|The total dose {{radiation}} and annealing {{responses of the}} back transistor of Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) pMOSFETs have been studied by comparing {{with those of the}} back transistor of SOI nMOSFETs fabricated on the same wafer. The transistors were irradiated by 60 Co γ-rays with various doses, and the front transistors are biased in a Float-State and Off-State, respectively, during irradiation. The total dose radiation responses of the back transistors are characterized by their threshold voltage shifts. The results show that the total dose radiation response of the back transistor of SOI pMOSFETs, similar to that of SOI nMOSFETs, depends greatly on their bias conditions during irradiation. However, with the Float-State bias, rather than the Off-State bias, the back transistors of SOI pMOSFETs reveal a much higher sensitivity to total dose radiation, which is contrary to those of SOI nMOSFETs. In addition, it is also found that the total dose radiation effect of the back transistor of SOI pMOSFETs irradiated with Off-State bias, {{as well as that of}} the SOI nMOSFETs, exhibits an increasing trend as the channel length decreases. The annealing response of the back transistors after irradiation at room temperature without bias, characterized by their threshold voltage shifts, indicates that there is a relatively complex annealing mechanism associated with channel length and <b>type,</b> <b>bias</b> condition during irradiation. In particular, for all the transistors irradiated with Off-State bias, their back transistors show an abnormal annealing effect during early annealing.

40|$|MAXENT is now {{a common}} species {{distribution}} modeling (SDM) tool used by conservation practitioners for predicting the distribution of a species from a set of records and environmental predictors. However, datasets of species occurrence used to train the model are often biased in the geographical space because of unequal sampling effort across the study area. This bias may {{be a source of}} strong inaccuracy in the resulting model and could lead to incorrect predictions. Although a number of sampling bias correction methods have been proposed, there is no consensual guideline to account for it. We compared here the performance of five methods of bias correction on three datasets of species occurrence: one "virtual" derived from a land cover map, and two actual datasets for a turtle (Chrysemys picta) and a salamander (Plethodon cylindraceus). We subjected these datasets to four types of sampling biases corresponding to potential types of empirical biases. We applied five correction methods to the biased samples and compared the outputs of distribution models to unbiased datasets to assess the overall correction performance of each method. The results revealed that the ability of methods to correct the initial sampling bias varied greatly depending on bias <b>type,</b> <b>bias</b> intensity and species. However, the simple systematic sampling of records consistently ranked among the best performing across the range of conditions tested, whereas other methods performed more poorly in most cases. The strong effect of initial conditions on correction performance highlights the need for further research to develop a step-by-step guideline to account for sampling bias. However, this method seems to be the most efficient in correcting sampling bias and should be advised in most cases...|$|E

40|$|The {{filtered}} cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) {{technique is}} a well established deposition method for wear resistant mechanical coatings. More recently, this method has attracted attention for growing ZnO based transparent conducting films. However, the potential of FCVA deposition to prepare ZnO layers for electronic devices is largely unexplored. This thesis addresses the use of FCVA deposition for the fabrication of active ZnO based electronic devices. The structural, electrical and optical characteristics of unintentionally doped ZnO films grown on different sapphire substrates were systematically investigated. The potential of FCVA to grow both polar and non-polar ZnO films was demonstrated. The resulting films showed considerable promise for device applications with properties including high transparency(> 90 %), moderate intrinsic carrier concentrations (10 ¹⁷ - 10 ¹⁹ cm⁻³), electron mobilities up to 110 cm⁻²/Vs, low surface roughness (< 5 nm) and well-structured photoluminescence. Post-growth annealing in oxygen at temperatures up to 800 C produced significant improvements in the electronic and optical properties of these films, due {{to the formation of}} larger grains with lower inter-grain potential barriers. Silver oxide (AgOᵪ) and iridium oxide (IrOᵪ) Schottky diodes fabricated on annealed FCVA ZnO films showed ideality factors as low as 1. 20, barrier heights up to 0. 85 eV and high sensitivity to ultraviolet light (up to ̴ 10 ⁻⁵ at - 2 V). Transparent and opaque MESFETs fabricated on these films showed well defined field effect characteristics, channel mobilities up to 70 cm⁻²/Vs and insensitivity to 1 mW/cm⁻² visible light. These devices were further subjected to extensive bias and temperature stress tests. MESFET stability appeared to be strongly dependent on Schottky gate <b>type,</b> <b>bias</b> conditions and ZnO film morphology. Positive bias stress of AgOᵪ gated devices resulted in irreversible damage, that is thought to be due to Ag electromigration across the gate interface. Mapping of the surface potential of the ZnO channel material with Kelvin probe force microscopy suggested a strong relationship between the defect density at grain boundaries and both channel mobility and current stability. Interval growth techniques were found to reduce the density of defects at grain boundaries and produced MESFETs with higher current stability. IrOᵪ gated devices showed superior bias stability and temperature resilience from 25 C- 195 C...|$|E
40|$|Mitigation {{climate change}} is an urgent and crucial {{challenge}} for a sustainable earth-system. Curbing tropical deforestation, and increasing absorption of carbon by (new) tropical forests is being considered as a relevant mitigation strategy because of the assumption {{that it can be}} implemented quickly and more cost-effective than other strategies. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) {{has become one of the}} initiatives most prominently present in research and international climate policy. The idea is to create incentives for developing countries and forest users to reduce carbon emissions by keeping their forests standing, reducing forest degradation, managing forests sustainably and increasing forest carbon stocks. However, in order to make the mechanism work and to design effective, efficient and equitable REDD+ policies, adequate information is needed on several aspects of the local land system where one wishes to intervene: this entails the current land use and land use evolutions, its drivers, and the socio-economic and carbon outcomes of different land use systems. Despite its importance in terms of forest cover and rising deforestation rates, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been underrepresented in studies that address these aspects, especially at subnational scales. In this thesis, we aimed at achieving a better understanding of two aspects of the shifting cultivation land system in Tshopo province: (1) the effects of biophysical conditions, land use and land management on ecosystem services delivery, in particular carbon sequestration, and (2) the drivers of the evolutions of land use and land management, including options for future transitions. In chapter 3, we analysed variation in aboveground carbon and forest structure in old-growth forests in the central Congo Basin, and assessed its implications for carbon mapping. We found that aboveground carbon (AGC) differed significantly within the region and between forest types. With an estimated aboveground carbon stock of 189 ± 40 Mg C ha- 1 mixed forest stored significantly less carbon than monodominant forest, storing 225 ± 58 Mg C ha- 1. The difference in AGC between the two forest types was due to differences in mean wood density and mean tree heights and not basal area. Our observations confirm generally lower aboveground carbon stocks in the central Congo Basin as compared to the outer fringes. Environmental drivers of AGC correlate to a large extent to environmental conditions determining the occurrence of the two forest types, with higher AGC on sandier soils, but drivers of AGC in mixed forest remain inconclusive. Taking differences in forest structure across forest types into account will benefit forest carbon mapping at different scales. Full inventory plot AGC estimations can benefit from improved accuracy when using forest type specific height:diameter relationships. We further tested the capacity of Asner’s LiDAR universal model in predicting regional level AGC in old-growth forest and found that AGC could be predicted with an 80 % precision. We also found that when differences in forest type are not taken into account, a forest <b>type</b> <b>bias</b> would be induced. In chapter 4, we evaluated the importance of management history and plant community properties on biomass stocks and biomass productivity in fallow systems in the central Congo Basin. The sampled fallows (aged 8. 7 ± 5. 5 years) had 62. 5 (± 47) Mg ha- 1 aboveground dry biomass (AGB), on an average. AGB was positively related to fallow age and negatively related to the number of previous cultivation cycles. Fallows in the fourth cycle stored significantly less carbon. We explored the relations between management history, landscape characteristics, woody plant community properties and annual biomass increment (ABI) in fallows aged 5 to 10 years. Three hypotheses on how woody plant community properties could affect ABI were tested: functional diversity, functional identity and vegetation quantity. Stem density was the strongest predictor of mean annual biomass increment (ABI), while also the community weighted mean of traits associated with pioneer species (low WD and low adult stature) was positively related to biomass recovery rates. Management history strongly determined these community properties, with the number of previous cultivation cycles negatively affecting stem density and community-weighted pioneer trait values, and with the biomass of remnant trees negatively related to community-weighted pioneer trait values. Our results imply that management intensity, i. e. mainly the number of previous cultivation cycles associated with repeated burning and weeding and with Chromolaena odorata invasion leads to a decrease in biomass recovery, with the main effect occurring through a reduction in the density of regenerating individuals. In chapter 5 we assessed the variation in deforestation rate and drivers at different scale levels, among which the village and household level. We detected considerable variation in deforestation rate at each scale levels, with highest variation at village and household level, which has gone unaddressed so far in DRC’s REDD+ strategy and projects. Village level deforestation rates were best predicted by the distance to Kisangani, the distance to the forest, the village ethnicity and the village population density. Individual household contributions to deforestation were also strongly unevenly distributed. Our results demonstrated that not the poorest households, but those with certain means in terms of social and human capital are more likely to participate in primary forest clearing. About half of the deforestation was attributed to only 8 % of households. For those households, deforestation is part of their development strategy, with both short and mid-term benefits (increased harvests), and long-term benefits (ownership over lands to be passed on to their children). In chapter 6 we examined to what extent the concept of local forest cover transitions can provide a framework to identify appropriate land use interventions. Using land cover, population and population density and the importance of different livelihoods, we identified three village level forest transition types: (i) high forest cover-low population, (ii) low forest cover-low population and (iii) low forest cover-high population. Perceptions of forest cover change and the evaluation of forest availability vary between these types. In general, forests were mostly valued for provisioning services and as a land reserve for future agricultural development. The most valued forest products were perceived to be in decline and scarce (except wood products), irrespective of the local forest transition type. We conclude that (i) local ownership of the purpose of forest conservation is not met in a majority of villages due to a perception of abundant forest cover, (ii) restricting forest conversion under REDD+ without readily available, acceptable and better functioning alternatives could result in maladaptive changes in land and resources management and negative livelihood and environmental outcomes, and (iii) interventions supporting higher agricultural outputs per ha will be best received in low forest-high population villages.
