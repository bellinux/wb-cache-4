40|$|BioREGIO Carpathians is a <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation</b> project, co-financed {{under the}} second {{call of the}} EU South East Europe <b>Transnational</b> <b>Cooperation</b> Programme, {{priority}} <b>area</b> "Protection and Improvement of the Environment". BioREGIO Carpathians run for three years (2011 – 2013) and is a flagship project for the Carpathian Convention (article four dealing with landscape and biological diversity), its Biodiversity Protocol and the Biodiversity Working Group. The project is built on the conservation, restoration and valorisation of the Carpathians ecological continuum to enable large herbivores and carnivores to live in coexistence with modern society. The Carpathian countries are expecting a massive pressure to modernize and extend their road infrastructures. If not considering the requirements of ecological network, this run-to-development will enhance landscape fragmentation, limit dispersal and genetic exchange of wildlife species. BioREGIO applied a multi-disciplinary approach (physical, legal and socio-economic) {{in order to identify}} the most influencing barriers regarding connectivity throughout the Carpathians. Using two ArcGIS 10. 0 tools in a three-step approach and a series of site visits, the continuity and connectivity analysis identified not only physical barriers but also legal aspects and socio-economic behaviour that are influencing ecological connectivity and playing a major role to conserve wildlife population. The investigation on the ground together with local experts and stakeholders enabled the adaptation of the GIS results and the development of feasible solutions to overcome the detected barriers with recommended priorities for implementing appropriate measurements to maintain connectivity and to sustain large carnivores, herbivores and biodiversity in the Carpathians...|$|R

This thesis will try to understand how far-right parties in European Parliament come together and cooperate despite their nationalist agenda and what is this cooperation’s impact on politics in Europe. This thesis assumes that contemporary far-right parties discard nationalistic concerns and aspirations in favor of <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In accordance with this purpose, definitions of ideology, fascism and far-right will be defined and then these definitions would help to understand which parties could be accepted as far-right parties.

40|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing debate about how (or through what mechanisms) global {{environmental}} norms have influenced domestic political debates {{that give rise to}} green policy choices. In particular, effective international environmental <b>cooperation</b> between <b>transnational</b> and domestic NGOs has been recognized as a key to successful environmental movements. In this regard, the central question guiding research on the politics of environmental norms is, under what condition(s) <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation</b> among NGOs {{would be more likely to}} be sustained so as to achieve its goals. This article proposes that one of the mechanisms missing from the debate is a bottom-up approach through which <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation</b> can be forged by the initiation of domestic NGOs. Drawing on social movement literature, it is hypothesized that domestic environmental NGOs with more resources, challenging ideologies, and more contentious modes of protest to dominant paradigms is more likely to nurture, develop, and sustain effective <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation</b> for environmental norms. The validity of this hypothesis is demonstrated through the examination of wetland recLAMation projects in Japan and Korea...|$|R

We examine both {{similarities and differences}} between the Nordic countries and between unions in different sectors, and make some comparisons with unions in other European countries. As a background, we first present the Nordic model(s) of industrial relations, and some important national and sectoral differences. Thereafter follows an analysis based on a survey carried out in 2010 - 11. The results show strong similarities between the Nordic countries regarding <b>transnational</b> union <b>cooperation</b> and union action, but also that there is greater diversity between sectors than between countries. The internationally exposed manufacturing sector is the most engaged in <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation,</b> followed by the construction industry. The more sheltered services sector has a somewhat lower degree of cooperation, and the professional/academic unions are the least engaged. This implies that, besides variation between countries, variation between sectors {{must be taken into account}} when analyzing the existence of a common Nordic approach to <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper first {{provides}} a short introduction of regionalism, i. e. international cooperation, {{and the concept}} of regional policies is presented. Then we introduce the concept of <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation,</b> which is a process quite distinctive, yet parallel to processes of international regionalism cooperation tending toward supranational integration. Origins of <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation,</b> i. e. states' regional cooperation across international borders, are discussed. The phenomenon of the process of regionalism and regionalization within Europe is dealt with. This trend is only seemingly opposed to the trend of international regionalism as manifested by integration processes between states. The nature of the state, though, does change since functions are delegated to the supranational and the subnational level. Both of these processes (regionalism and regionalization), as well as <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation</b> of states, furthers the awareness of subnational regions as political units responsible for their own social and economic development. Transfrontier cooperation has triggered the idea of international subnational regional cooperation. The study provides examples of both phenomenon. Integration processes and the importance of the decision-making process on the supranational level for the well-being of the subnational level tends to cause the subnational regions to join in their own international political organizations to exercise pressure on the international level. Supranational bodies, for their own reasons, have accepted regions as specific partners. This paper provides examples of these international political organizations...|$|R

Cooperation among Danube countries has particular importance as regards to coordination of Research and Innovation (R&I) activities since they contribute significantly to competitiveness and economic growth of the macro-region and are at the same time the <b>areas</b> where <b>cooperation</b> and knowledge sharing across borders may crucially contribute to achieving best results. The purpose of this Policy Brief is to identify and examine the key issues that can contribute to the enhanced R&I cooperation in the Danube macro-region. On the other hand the report also briefly summarizes discussions among the experts at the workshop organised by DG REGIO and DG JRC in Brussels in April 2014. The report thus aims to take a stock of the state-of-the art of the current Danube cooperation activities and provide some guidance to the stakeholders on how to best enhance R&I cooperation in the Danube macro-region. The guide attempts to highlight some concrete suggestions on how to better implement governance mechanisms of <b>transnational</b> R&I <b>cooperation,</b> to revise the existing financing tools of cross-border and <b>transnational</b> <b>cooperation</b> in support of the project holders, and points out some synergies between EU funding sources that may be exploited to facilitate <b>transnational</b> R&I <b>cooperation</b> in the Danube macro-region.
