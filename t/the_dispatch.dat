5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. <b>The</b> <b>Dispatch</b> published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of <b>the</b> <b>Dispatch</b> learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of <b>the</b> <b>Dispatch</b> and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E

5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the single}} {{objective}} Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) {{the problem is}} usually separated in two sub-problems : the commitment problem which aims to fix the on/off scheduling of each unit and <b>the</b> <b>dispatching</b> problem which goal is to schedule the production of each turned on unit. <b>The</b> <b>dispatching</b> problem is a continuous convex prob-lem that can easily be solved exactly. For the first sub-problem genetic algorithms (GA) are often applied and usually handle binary vectors rep-resenting the solutions of the commitment problem. Then the solutions are decoded in solving <b>the</b> <b>dispatching</b> problem with an exact method to obtain the precise production of each unit. In this paper a multi-objective version of the UCP taking the emission of gas into account is presented. In this multi objective UCP <b>the</b> <b>dispatching</b> problem re-mains easy to solve whereas considering it separatly remains interesting. A multi-objective GA handling binary vectors is applied. However for a binary representation there {{is a set of}} solutions of <b>the</b> <b>dispatching</b> prob-lem that are pareto equivalent. Three decoding strategies are proposed and compared. The main contribution of this paper is the third decoding strategy which attaches an approximation of the Pareto front from <b>the</b> associated <b>dispatching</b> problem to each genotypic solution. It is shown that this decoding strategy leads to better results in comparison to the other ones...|$|R

Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems. It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.|$|E

30|$|The {{study in}} [3] focuses on proposing {{a method to}} {{schedule}} <b>the</b> <b>dispatched</b> power of <b>the</b> wind farm-dual BESS scheme, so as to meet the prevailing power market requirements. However, various {{studies have shown that}} BESS is an excellent power system asset for providing system frequency regulation function [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Indeed frequency regulation is even recognized as the most profitable application of energy storage in power system [12]. It is in the context of providing frequency control that the proposed scheme has excellent potential. The variable nature of wind has often resulted in <b>the</b> <b>dispatched</b> output power of the dual-BESS scheme at levels much less than the rated power of the wind farm/converters. Therefore, the capacity margin between <b>the</b> <b>dispatched</b> power and <b>the</b> rated power of the converters can be used to support the frequency regulation function: an ancillary service which is also profitable to the wind farm operator, in addition to the sale of <b>the</b> <b>dispatched</b> power [1].|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, Bridgwater {{was also}} home {{to a number of}} iron foundries. George Hennet's Bridgwater Iron Works worked on bridges, {{railways}} and machinery for Brunel and Robert Stephenson. This location allowed the import by boat of raw materials from Wales and <b>the</b> <b>dispatch</b> of finished work to south Devon using the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The carriage workshops for the latter were on an adjacent site. The works passed to his son and then traded as Hennet, Spink & Else. Some of the ironwork was produced for the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash, Cornwall. In 1873 it became the Bridgwater Engineering Company Limited but this failed in 1878. W Wills Ltd produced steam locomotives and fingerposts.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-450s the Athenians {{launched}} an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, {{which led to}} a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the Nile Delta. The campaign culminated in disaster; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed. In 451–450 BC the Athenians sent troops to Cyprus. Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus, although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that <b>the</b> <b>dispatch</b> of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon's policy.|$|E

3000|$|The setup of {{low-voltage}} starting differential {{current protection}} of OCS at SS [...] i [...] {{is to meet}} the quick-action requirement.

The MSS or <b>the</b> <b>dispatching</b> center can set up backup protection based on acquired OCS voltages and currents from each of SSs.

5|$|By 11 a.m., it {{was clear}} that a {{breakthrough}} was not forthcoming and the advances by Sherman and McPherson were failures. Just then, Grant received a message from McClernand, which stated that he was heavily engaged, the Confederates were being reinforced, and he requested a diversion on his right from McPherson's corps. Grant initially refused the request, telling McClernand to use his own reserve forces for assistance; Grant was mistakenly under the impression that McClernand had been lightly engaged and McPherson heavily, although the reverse was true. McClernand followed up with a message that was partially misleading, implying that he had captured two forts"The Stars and Stripes are flying over them."—and that another push along the line would achieve victory for the Union Army. Although Grant once again demurred, he showed <b>the</b> <b>dispatch</b> to Sherman, who ordered his own corps to advance again. Grant, reconsidering, then ordered McPherson to send Quinby's division to aid McClernand.|$|E
5|$|In 1353, John and {{his family}} were granted Venetian citizenship, which hints that his domain was under the {{protection}} of Venice. The premature death of Stephen Dušan in 1355 plunged the Serbian Empire into civil war. In that conflict, John took the side of his wife's son-in-law Simeon Uroš against the legitimate successor Stephen Uroš, who was Stephen Dušan's son and Simeon Uroš's nephew. While Simeon's attempt at taking the throne was ill-fated and Stephen Uroš even captured Berat in 1356, John managed to preserve his remaining lands and became independent from both Simeon and Stephen Uroš. The threat of Nikephoros II Orsini, who was gaining ground in Thessaly and Epirus, forced John to request <b>the</b> <b>dispatch</b> of a Venetian warship and an administrator from Venice to take control of his domain, to which the republic obliged.|$|E

Willaumez then took his fleet southwards, followed from 09:00 by Beresford's squadron. The French fleet passed between Belle Île and Quiberon and then around Île d'Yeu, passing the Phares des Baleines on Île de Ré at 22:30. There the fleet was sighted by frigate HMS Amethyst under Captain Michael Seymour, the scout for the Rochefort blockade squadron of HMS Caesar, HMS Defiance and HMS Donegal under Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford, which was anchored off the Phare de Chassiron on Ile d'Oléron. Signal rockets from Amethyst alerted Stopford to Willaumez's presence and Stopford closed with Willaumez during the night but was {{not strong enough to}} oppose his entry into the Basque Roads {{at the mouth of the}} Charente River on the morning of 24 February.|$|E
