5|$|Eichmann {{attended}} the Kaiser Franz Joseph Staatsoberrealschule (state secondary school) in Linz, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>high</b> school Adolf Hitler had attended some 17 years before. He played the violin {{and participated in}} sports and clubs, including a Wandervogel woodcraft and scouting group that included some older boys {{who were members of}} various right-wing militias. His poor school performance resulted in his father withdrawing him from the Realschule and enrolling him in the Höhere Bundeslehranstalt für Elektrotechnik, Maschinenbau und Hochbau vocational college. He left without attaining a degree and joined his father's new enterprise, the Untersberg Mining Company, where he worked for several months. From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a sales clerk for the Oberösterreichische Elektrobau AG radio company. Next, between 1927 and early 1933, Eichmann worked in Upper Austria and Salzburg as district agent for the Vacuum Oil Company AG.|$|E
5|$|Lady Gaga: Queen of Pop has 288 pages, {{including}} 32 {{pages of}} photographs of the musician. The author compares Lady Gaga to Madonna, writing that both are independent and work to assert control over their futures. The book discusses Lady Gaga's early life and background, including her upbringing in a New York City household with her father, a businessman. Born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta on March 28, 1986, from age 11 she attended Convent of the Sacred Heart high school; <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>high</b> school as Paris Hilton. Germanotta was not popular with her fellow pupils because of her experimentation with exotic dance, drugs, and bisexuality. By age 13, she had written her first song and her mother took her to nightclubs to perform at open-mic events. Germanotta gained entry to the Tisch School of the Arts in New York at age 17, but left and started using drugs while performing as a go-go dancer. After a period of difficulty with her father, she ceased this behavior pattern.|$|E

Unlike the generalized empirical likelihood estimators, our new estimators are much easier to compute. A simulation study finds that our estimators have better finite sample performance than the two-step GMM, and compare well to several potential alternatives in terms of both computational stability and overall performance. ...|$|R

5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>high</b> school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} public {{corruption}} scandal of Daley's tenure as mayor involved {{the circumstances of}} the resignation of his City Council floor leader, Alderman Patrick Huels, in October 1997. Daley, Huels, and another close friend Michael Tadin grew up within two blocks on S. Emerald Avenue in Bridgeport. Huels attended De La Salle Institute, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>high</b> school attended by Daley, his father, and Michael Bilandic. Huels worked for the city's Public Works Department as a laborer and tree trimmer, then as an administrative assistant in the Environment Department, and then as a City Council investigator. He answered phones for the 11th Ward Democratic organization, and was its secretary for several years. When Mayor Richard J. Daley died, 11th Ward Alderman Bilandic was named acting mayor, and Huels, then 26, replaced Bilandic as alderman. Huels chaired the Council's Transportation Committee and became Mayor Richard M. Daley's floor leader. In the summer of 2007, in reaction to ongoing indictments and convictions of aldermen, Daley and Huels shepherded a package of ethics reforms through city council. Huels owned a security firm, SDI Security, Inc. along with his wife and his brother, a Chicago police lieutenant. In the mid-1990s, the firm had about 390 full-time employees and was grossing $7 million a year. Huels was president and a director, and Council Finance Committee Chairman Alderman Edward M. Burke (14th) was secretary. Huels and Burke authorized $633,971 in legal consulting fees from their respective Council committees to attorney Michael A. Pedicone, a long-time officer of SDI. In March 1995 the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on SDI for $326,951 and in June 1996 for $997,382 for failing to pay payroll taxes, including money withheld from its employees' pay checks.|$|E
