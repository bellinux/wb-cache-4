25|$|Bryant has {{conducted}} numerous treatment trials on Post-traumatic stress disorder {{with a focus}} on cognitive behaviour therapy. In terms of treatment of PTSD, he has also conducted the first studies that showed genetic markers of <b>treatment</b> <b>response,</b> brain regions using functional MRI and structural MRI to predict <b>treatment</b> <b>response,</b> and how cognitive behaviour therapy alters brain function in PTSD patients. He has also conducted seminal studies on the development of PTSD by assessing people prior to trauma and subsequent to the trauma; these studies have mapped core psychophysiological and cognitive risk factors for developing PTSD.|$|E

40|$|We show random {{assignment}} is insu ¢ cient for valid inference regarding signs and magnitudes of causal e¤ects in dynamic environments. In such settings, measured <b>treatment</b> <b>responses</b> are contingent upon the typically unmodeled policy generating process. With binary assignment, {{this results in}} signi 8 ̆ 5 cant attenuation bias. With more than two policy states, treatment re-sponses can be biased downward, upward, or have the wrong sign. Further, {{it is not only}} generally invalid to extrapolate elasticities across processes, as argued by Lucas (1976), but also to extrapolate within the same policy process. We derive auxiliary assumptions beyond random assignment for valid inference in dynamic settings. If all possible policy transitions are rare events, <b>treatment</b> <b>responses</b> approximate causal e¤ects. However, reliance on rare events is overly-restrictive as the necessary and su ¢ cient condition for equality of <b>treatment</b> <b>responses</b> and causal e¤ects is that all possible policy variable changes have mean zero. If these conditions are not met, we show how <b>treatment</b> <b>responses</b> can nevertheless be corrected and mapped back to causal e¤ects or extrapolated to forecast responses to future policy changes within or across policy processes. A correction is also provided for structural parameter inference in dynamic treatment settings...|$|R

25|$|When {{treating}} cancer it {{is useful}} to have precise measurements of the total body disease burden. It helps with determining prognostic significance and <b>treatment</b> <b>response.</b> This is normally done using computed tomography (CT scans), positron emission tomography (PET scans) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These medical imaging procedures are expensive and are not without their own problems. These imaging techniques are not able to accurately resolve small tumors (≤1cm in diameter). Imaging can also be affected by radiation-induced inflammation and fibrotic changes, making is hard to determine if there is residual tumor or just effects of treatment.|$|E
500|$|The two {{amphetamine}} enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) {{alleviate the}} symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing {{the activity of the}} neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which results in part from their interactions with trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. [...] Dextroamphetamine is a more potent [...] stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer elimination half-life (i.e., it remains in the body longer) than dextroamphetamine. The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the <b>treatment</b> <b>response</b> in some individuals relative to dextroamphetamine alone. Adderall's active ingredient, amphetamine, shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human trace amines, particularly phenethylamine and , the latter of which is a positional isomer of amphetamine.|$|E

2500|$|While OCD {{has been}} {{considered}} a homogenous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits {{may be due to}} comorbid disorders.

Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and <b>treatment</b> <b>response.</b> [...] Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions. [...] On the other hand, subtype dependent <b>treatment</b> <b>response</b> has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular {{pathology}} {{is focused}} upon {{the study and}} diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids. [...] Molecular pathology is multidisciplinary by nature and shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genetics. [...] It is often applied in a context that is as much scientific as directly medical and encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for <b>treatment</b> <b>response</b> and disease progression, and the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to particular disorders. [...] The crossover between molecular pathology and epidemiology is represented by a related field [...] "molecular pathological epidemiology".|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{assessment}} can {{be characterized}} as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are {{made on the basis of}} what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological test results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or [...] "mechanical" [...] fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., <b>treatment</b> <b>response).</b> Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heat {{illness is}} a {{preventable}} disorder in military populations. Measures that protect vulnerable individuals {{and contribute to}} effective Immediate Treatment may reduce the impact of heat illness, but depend upon adequate understanding and awareness among Commanders and their troops. OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors for heat illness in British soldiers deployed to the hot Collective Training Environment (CTE) and to explore awareness of Immediate <b>Treatment</b> <b>responses.</b> METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to British soldiers deployed in the hot CTEs of Kenya and Canada. Responses were analysed to determine the prevalence of individual (Intrinsic) and Command-practice (Extrinsic) risk factors for heat illness and the self-reported awareness of key Immediate Treatment priorities (recognition, first aid and casualty evacuation). RESULTS: The prevalence of Intrinsic risk factors was relatively low in comparison with Extrinsic risk factors. The majority of respondents were aware of key Immediate <b>Treatment</b> <b>responses.</b> The most frequently reported factors in each domain were increased risk by body composition scoring, inadequate time for heat acclimatisation and insufficient briefing about casualty evacuation. CONCLUSIONS: Novel data on the distribution and scale of risk factors for heat illness are presented. A collective approach to risk reduction by the accumulation of 'marginal gains' is proposed for the UK military. This should focus on limiting Intrinsic risk factors before deployment, reducing Extrinsic factors during training and promoting timely Immediate <b>Treatment</b> <b>responses</b> within the hot CTE...|$|R
