5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his {{position}} as virtual prime minister of the kingdom. By his advice Ælfstan {{was appointed to the}} Bishopric of London, and Oswald to that of Worcester. In 963, Æthelwold, the Abbot of Abingdon, was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church. The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible. He forbade the practices of simony (selling ecclesiastical offices for money) and ended the custom of clerics appointing relatives to offices under their jurisdiction. Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place of the secular canons; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of the Christian faith, but also trades to improve their position. The state saw reforms as well. Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids. There was a level of peace in the kingdom unknown in living memory.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{being of}} <b>truth</b> is <b>the</b> redoubling [...] of truth within yourself, within me, within him, that your life, my life, his life expresses <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> {{approximately}} in <b>the</b> striving for it, that your life, my life, {{his life is}} approximately the being of <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in <b>the</b> striving for it, just as <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> was in Christ a life, for he was <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> And therefore, Christianly understood, truth is obviously not to know <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> but to be <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Despite all modern philosophy, there is an infinite difference here, best seen in Christ's relation to Pilate, for Christ could not, could only untruthfully reply to the question [...] "What is truth?" [...] precisely {{because he was not}} the one who knew what truth is but was <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Not as if {{he did not know what}} truth is, but when one is <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and when <b>the</b> requirement is to be <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> to know <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is untruth. For knowing <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is something that entirely of itself accompanies being <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> not <b>the</b> other way around. And that is why it becomes untruth when knowing <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is separated from being <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> or when knowing <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is made identical with being it, since it is related the other way. Being <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is identical with knowing <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> and Christ would never have known <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> if he has not been it, and nobody knows more of <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> than what he is of <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Practice in Christianity, 1848, Hong, 1991, p. 205-206 ...|$|R

25|$|For Bernard, {{faith is}} based on the {{testimony}} of Scripture and on the teaching of the Fathers of the Church. Thus, Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and, in a more general way, with those who would subject <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of faith to the critical examination of reason — an examination which, in his opinion, posed a grave danger: intellectualism, the relativizing of truth, and the questioning of <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in contemplative prayer, by the affective union of the heart and mind with God, with only one purpose: to promote the living, intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.|$|E

25|$|Logic is {{concerned}} with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a metaphysician does. Logicians use formal languages to express <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system.|$|E
25|$|In Christian faith, {{theologians and}} {{philosophers}} {{make a distinction}} between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.|$|E

25|$|The Heavenly Doctrine {{rejects the}} concept of {{salvation}} through faith-alone (sola-fide in Latin), since he considered both faith and charity necessary for salvation, not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although {{it must be a}} faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to The Heavenly Doctrine, is to lead a person to a life according to <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.|$|E
25|$|The {{source for}} the ethics of Buddhists {{around the world are}} the Three Jewels of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. The Buddha is seen as the {{discoverer}} of liberating knowledge and hence the foremost teacher. The Dharma is both the teachings of the Buddha's path and <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of these teachings. The Sangha is the community of noble ones (ariya), who practice the Dhamma and have attained some knowledge and can thus provide guidance and preserve the teachings. Having proper understanding of the teachings is vital for proper ethical conduct. The Buddha taught that right view was a necessary prerequisite for right conduct.|$|E
25|$|John Duns Scotus (1266–1308), Doctor Subtilis, was {{a member}} of the Franciscan Order, philosopher and theologian. Emerging from the {{academic}} environment of the University of Oxford. where the presence of Grosseteste and Bacon was still palpable, he had a different view on the relationship between reason and faith as that of Thomas Aquinas. For Duns Scotus, <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of faith could not be comprehended through the use of reason. Philosophy, hence, should not be a servant to theology, but act independently. He was the mentor of one of the greatest names of philosophy in the Middle Ages: William of Ockham.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Greek {{philosophers}} took {{such questions}} very seriously. Indeed, {{many of their}} general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423BC 348/347BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, {{in a world of}} mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts {{that it is possible to}} come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who believe}} in the {{inspiration}} of scripture teach that it is infallible (or inerrant), that is, free from error in <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> it expresses by its character as the word of God. However, the scope of what this encompasses is disputed, as the term includes 'faith and practice' positions, with some denominations holding that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. Other scholars take stronger views, but for a few verses these positions require more exegetical work, leading to dispute (compare the serious debate over the related issue of perspicuity, attracting biblical and philosophical discussion).|$|E
25|$|Sravana {{literally}} means hearing, and broadly {{refers to}} perception and observations typically {{aided by a}} counsellor or teacher (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. Manana refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on svadhyaya and sravana. Nididhyāsana refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of <b>the</b> <b>truths,</b> non-duality and a state {{where there is a}} fusion of thought and action, knowing and being. Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as sadhana practice that unifies Yoga and Karma ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions.|$|E

25|$|Gurdjieff {{argued that}} many of the {{existing}} forms of religious and spiritual tradition on Earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception. As a result, humans were failing to realize <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of ancient teachings and were instead becoming more and more like automatons, susceptible to control from outside and increasingly capable of otherwise unthinkable acts of mass psychosis such as World War I. At best, the various surviving sects and schools could provide only a one-sided development, which did not result in a fully integrated human being.|$|E
25|$|The Prince {{takes his}} time {{dressing}} for {{his meeting with}} Don Calogero, and when he finally goes downstairs, he has {{a vision of the}} two of them as animals. Their conversation is, for the most part, polite, with both men making occasional slips into tactlessness but both ultimately making <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of the situation quite apparent. For the Prince, that truth involves Tancredi's excellent lineage but extreme poverty, while for Calogero the truth involves his wealth, which is much greater than the Prince ever realized, and the fact that Don Calogero is in final negotiations to purchase the title of Baroness for his daughter. An agreement is reached that the marriage is to proceed.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle of}} the 20th century was the {{beginning}} of the dominance of analytic philosophy in America. Analytic philosophy, prior to its arrival in America, had begun in Europe with the work of Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the logical positivists. According to logical positivism, <b>the</b> <b>truths</b> of logic and mathematics are tautologies, and those of science are empirically verifiable. Any other claim, including the claims of ethics, aesthetics, theology, metaphysics, and ontology, are meaningless (this theory is called verificationism). With the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, many positivists fled Germany to Britain and America, and this helped reinforce the dominance of analytic philosophy in the United States in subsequent years.|$|E
