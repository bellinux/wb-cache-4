5|$|The {{perception}} of greenness (in opposition to redness forming {{one of the}} opponent mechanisms in human color vision) is evoked by light which <b>triggers</b> the medium-wavelength M cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength L cones. Light which <b>triggers</b> this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570nm.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for the T cell-mediated {{mechanism}} of mucosal destruction is strong, but the exact <b>triggers</b> for this process are unknown and {{are thought to}} be multiple and varied from one person to the next. This suggests {{that there are a number}} of possible <b>triggers,</b> each of which is capable of producing the disease in different subgroups. In other words, different subgroups appear to have different causes for the condition. These can be considered in three general groups, namely primary immuno-dysregulation, decrease of the mucosal barrier and states of heightened antigenic sensitivity (see below). Risk factors in aphthous stomatitis are also sometimes considered as either host-related or environmental.|$|E
50|$|If the <b>trigger</b> {{is created}} {{on a table}} or view, then the <b>triggering</b> event is {{composed}} of DML statements, and the <b>trigger</b> is called a DML <b>trigger.</b> If the <b>trigger</b> is created on a schema or the database, then the <b>triggering</b> event is composed of either DDL or database operation statements, and the <b>trigger</b> is called a system <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A single set <b>trigger</b> {{is usually}} one <b>trigger</b> {{that may be}} fired with a {{conventional}} amount of <b>trigger</b> pull weight or may be [...] "set" [...] – usually by pushing forward on the <b>trigger,</b> or by pushing forward on a small lever attached {{to the rear of}} the <b>trigger.</b> This takes up the <b>trigger</b> slack (or otherwise called take-up) in the <b>trigger</b> and allows for a much lighter <b>trigger</b> pull. This is colloquially known as a hair <b>trigger.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Trigger</b> locks prevent {{motion of}} the <b>trigger.</b> However, a <b>trigger</b> lock does not {{guarantee}} that the firearm cannot be discharged (see above). Some <b>trigger</b> locks are integrated into {{the design of the}} weapon, requiring no external parts besides the key. Generally, two pieces come together from either side behind the <b>trigger</b> and are locked in place, which can be unlocked with a key or combination. This physically prevents the <b>trigger</b> from being pulled to discharge the weapon. Other types of <b>trigger</b> locks do not go behind the <b>trigger,</b> but encompass the full area behind the <b>trigger</b> guard making the <b>trigger</b> inaccessible. Identilock is a gun attachment that completely covers and prevents access to the <b>trigger,</b> which makes it different from other <b>trigger</b> locks.|$|R
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the <b>triggers</b> of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|His name is {{frequently}} mentioned in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 (1961), in {{a recurring theme}} wherein his name is signed by other people to documents, which <b>triggers</b> several military investigations as to who Washington Irving is.|$|E
5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these <b>triggers</b> can be important to treat the episode effectively.|$|E
50|$|An INSTEAD OF <b>trigger</b> is either: A DML <b>trigger</b> {{created on}} a view or a system <b>trigger</b> defined on a CREATE statement. The {{database}} fires the INSTEAD OF <b>trigger</b> {{instead of running}} the <b>triggering</b> statement.|$|R
50|$|You {{create a}} <b>trigger</b> with the CREATE <b>TRIGGER</b> {{statement}}. You specify the <b>triggering</b> event {{in terms of}} <b>triggering</b> statements, and the item they act on. The <b>trigger</b> {{is said to be}} created on or defined on the item—which is either a table, a view, a schema, or the database. You also specify the timing point, which determines whether the <b>trigger</b> fires before or after the <b>triggering</b> statement runs and whether it fires for each row that the <b>triggering</b> statement affects.|$|R

The efficacy of the dedicated diffractive <b>trigger</b> stream is demonstrated for hard single-diffractive and double-Pomeron exchange events...|$|R
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also <b>triggers</b> the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire <b>triggers</b> seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Maillard et al. and Li et al. provide {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells. Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist, such as miRNAs expressed by the herpes virus that may act as heterochromatin organization <b>triggers</b> to mediate viral latency.|$|E
5|$|Mature plasmodia {{can produce}} fruit bodies under {{appropriate}} circumstances, the exact <b>triggers</b> for this process are unknown.

The plasmodia abandon their nutrient intake and crawl, attracted by lighta positive phototaxistowards a dry, light area, to get an optimal spread of the spores. Once the fructification begins, it can not be stopped. If disturbances occur, malformed spore-bearing fruit bodies are often produced.|$|E
40|$|A fast {{tracking}} <b>trigger</b> {{system based}} on a new scintillating fiber tracker is being built for the upgraded D 0 detector for the Collider Run II at Fermilab.

30|$|It is {{remarkable}} that P-wave <b>triggering</b> {{was found in}} regions where NVT has been observed <b>triggered</b> by the passage of surface waves. If the <b>triggered</b> event in western Shikoku {{is related to the}} NVT, P-wave <b>triggering</b> {{is the beginning of the}} <b>triggering</b> sequence of NVT. The <b>triggering</b> strain due to P-waves is of the order of 10 − 8, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the <b>triggering</b> strain found for surface-wave <b>triggering.</b> Miyazawa and Brodsky (2008) observed clear surface-wave <b>triggering</b> when the normal strain changes are at least of the order of 10 − 8. In the present method, the epicenter of the <b>triggered</b> events is not well resolved and the depth is not determined, however, the region with a high spectral ratio in western Shikoku corresponds to the locations of <b>triggered</b> NVT during surface-wave arrivals.|$|R
5000|$|Older WASR-series rifles {{commonly}} caused <b>trigger</b> slap, {{which is}} caused by the bolt slamming backward into the <b>trigger</b> assembly and causing significant pain to the shooter's <b>trigger</b> finger.

40|$|Failure {{of patient}} <b>triggered</b> {{ventilation}} in very premature infants {{may reflect the}} use of inappropriate <b>triggering</b> systems. We have therefore compared the performance of an airway and a body surface <b>trigger</b> in 12 infants of median gestational age 26 weeks (range 24 - 27). Airway flow and oesophageal and ventilator pressure changes were recorded during two periods of patient <b>triggered</b> ventilation. From the traces, the degree of asynchrony (inflation extending beyond inspiration), <b>triggering</b> rate, sensitivity (proportion of the infant's breaths detected) and <b>trigger</b> delay (response time) were calculated. Although with both <b>triggering</b> systems there was {{a high rate of}} asynchrony, the <b>triggering</b> rate (p < 0. 05), sensitivity (p < 0. 05) and <b>trigger</b> delay (p < 0. 01) were all better with the body surface <b>trigger.</b> These results suggest that the body surface <b>trigger</b> is the more appropriate system for very immature infants...|$|R
40|$|The <b>trigger</b> {{process of}} L 3 +Cosmics {{experiment}} at CERN is introduced briefly. Also we checked whether the settings of the L 3 +Cosmics <b>trigger</b> system by simulation are correct or not and introduced {{a method for}} <b>trigger</b> efficiency calculation. To get the <b>trigger</b> efficiency for the mu spectrum measurement, an experimental data sample, which includes events passing the <b>trigger</b> set to measure the mu spectrum, not passing, is needed. Then L 3 +C <b>trigger</b> process is simulated with these events in this sample {{to know how many}} events should pass the <b>trigger.</b> By checking a <b>trigger</b> bit recorded in the experimental data, one can know how many events passed the <b>trigger</b> in hardware in these simulated events. The ratio then determines the <b>trigger</b> efficiency for mu spectrum measurement, and the systematic error is analyzed. The results on <b>trigger</b> efficiency have been used in measurement of the mu spectrum. (8 refs) ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>triggers</b> for {{precipitation}} of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other <b>triggers</b> believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} new {{medications}} are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it <b>triggers</b> an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E
5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures.

40|$|AbstractIn 2010 and 2011, the ATLAS {{experiment}} successfully recorded {{data from}} LHC collisions with high efficiency and excellent data quality. ATLAS employs a three-level <b>trigger</b> system to select events {{of interest for}} physics analyzes and detector commissioning. The <b>trigger</b> system consists of a custom-designed hardware <b>trigger</b> at level- 1 and software algorithms at the two higher levels. The <b>trigger</b> selection is deﬁned by a <b>trigger</b> menu which consists of more than 300 individual <b>trigger</b> signatures, such as electrons, muons, particle jets, etc. An execution of a <b>trigger</b> signature incurs computing and data storage costs. The composition of the deployed <b>trigger</b> menu depends on the instantaneous LHC luminosity, the experiment's goals for the recorded data, and the limits imposed by the available computing power, network bandwidth and storage space. This paper describes a <b>trigger</b> monitoring framework for assigning computing costs for individual <b>trigger</b> signatures and <b>trigger</b> menus as a whole. These costs can be extrapolated to higher luminosity allowing development of <b>trigger</b> menus for a higher LHC collision rate than currently achievable...|$|R
40|$|Gamma Ray Array Detector (GRAD) {{is one of}} External Target Facility (ETF) {{subsystems}} at the Heavy Ion Research Facility at Lanzhou. The <b>trigger</b> subsystem of the GRAD {{has been}} developed based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs) and PXI interface. The GRAD <b>trigger</b> subsystem makes prompt L 1 <b>trigger</b> decisions to select valid events. These decisions are made by processing the hit signals from 1024 CsI scintillators of the GRAD. According to the physical requirements, the GRAD <b>trigger</b> subsystem generates 12 -bit <b>trigger</b> signals that are passed to the ETF global <b>trigger</b> system. In addition, the GRAD <b>trigger</b> subsystem generates <b>trigger</b> data that are packed and transmitted to the host computer via PXI bus for off-line analysis. The <b>trigger</b> processing is implemented in the front-end electronics and one FPGA of the <b>trigger</b> module. The logic of PXI transmission and reconfiguration is implemented in the other FPGA of the <b>trigger</b> module. The reliable and efficient performance in the Gamma-ray experiments demonstrates that the GRAD <b>trigger</b> subsystem is capable to satisfy the physical requirements.

30|$|Aftershocks {{following}} {{the occurrence of}} a mainshock are <b>triggered</b> by two main processes: dynamic <b>triggering</b> and static <b>triggering.</b> Dynamic <b>triggering</b> occurs when seismic waves travelling away from the first earthquake cause transient stress perturbations that <b>trigger</b> aftershocks. This has been observed to occur at quite large distances, but at large distances the <b>triggering</b> appears {{to be limited to}} fairly small aftershocks. Static <b>triggering,</b> also known as Coulomb stress transfer (CST), is based on the hypothesis that instantaneous and permanent stress changes near the source region of one earthquake can <b>trigger</b> other earthquakes by increasing the stress on the neighboring faults on which they occur [16].|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule <b>triggers</b> smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential <b>triggers</b> include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
50|$|A second {{common cause}} of negligent {{discharges}} is when the gun-handler places their finger on the <b>trigger</b> before they have decided to shoot.
