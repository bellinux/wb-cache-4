25|$|A {{variant of}} the tumble turn {{is to make a}} {{somersault}} earlier with straight legs, throwing the legs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and gliding to the wall. This has a small risk of injury because the legs could hit another swimmer or the wall.|$|E
25|$|Lifsh {{believed}} {{he had the right}} of way to proceed through the intersection because of the police escort. Lifsh said he deliberately steered his car away from adults on the sidewalk, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> a distance of about , in order to stop the car. Lifsh later commented that the car did not come to a full stop upon impact with the building, but rather slid to the left along the wall until it reached the children.|$|E
500|$|Whenever the PRC {{national}} flag is flown {{together with the}} regional Hong Kong flag, the {{national flag}} must be flown at the centre, above the regional flag, or otherwise in a more prominent position {{than that of the}} regional flag. The regional flag must be smaller in size than the national flag, and it must be displayed {{to the left of the}} national flag. [...] When the flags are displayed inside a building, the left and right sides of a person looking at the flags, and with his or her back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag. [...] When the flags are displayed outside a building, the left and right sides of a person standing in front of the building and looking towards the front entrance are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag. [...] The national flag should be raised before the regional flag is raised, and it should be lowered after the regional flag is lowered.|$|E

60|$|I {{expected}} to see every man spring <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{in order to learn}} for himself what had caused the alarm, and at any other time they would have done so; but so great was the sense of impending danger that instinctively the garrison formed in line ready for orders.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} is described {{of the effect}} of transverse mean-velocity and temperature gradients on sound attenuation in acoustically treated two-dimensional ducts. The results show that cooling <b>the</b> duct <b>walls</b> leads to channeling <b>the</b> sound <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> for both downstream and upstream propagation. The effect of mean-temperature gradients on the attenuation rates of the lowest three modes can be as important as the effect of mean-velocity gradients...|$|R

50|$|As the Japanese approached, Korean {{soldiers}} straggled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> seeking {{protection of}} the castle. When Hwang Jin saw this he realized he could not open the gates. If he did, the Japanese would swarm in and capture the fort.

60|$|Cnut, {{immediately}} ordering {{four of his}} men {{to escort}} Dame Editha to the wood with all speed, advanced with his men <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> All had strung their bows and placed their arrows {{on the ground in}} front of them in readiness for instant use. Cnut himself, with two others carrying the rope, advanced to the edge of the moat. None observed their doings, for all within the castle were intent upon the proceedings there.|$|R

60|$|The hangman {{turned and}} bowed in mock reverence to the spectators beneath him. He {{had not yet}} learned in a land of puny archers how sure and how strong is the English bow.

60|$|The tramp of {{soldiers}} in the street beyond ceased suddenly at the sound from within the factory yard. It was a detail of the guard marching to the relief of sentries.

60|$|He stopped, {{for there}} was {{a step in the}} courtyard, a foot upon the threshold, and a {{stranger}} entered.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} model {{to account for}} the behavior of suspended nanoparticles under magnetohydrodynamic conditions. The Lorentz force not only drags nanoparticle flocs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> reducing <b>the</b> distance between flocs resulting a more negative total pair interaction potential energy, but also produces extra magnetic-induced stresses inside a floc leading to a change of pair interaction distance thus giving rise to a less negative total potential energy. The model explains quite well the recent experimental results showing that magnetic field assists aggregation in laminar or weak turbulent flows, but favors floc disruption in turbulent regime.
