Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> of 1939.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Paper,</b> the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) {{was set up to}} examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> {{published}} by <b>the</b> Chinese government {{from the perspective of}} public diplomacy. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> are political documents in which the Chinese authorities state their official stances regarding a variety of domestic and international affairs. The study approaches <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> from <b>the</b> theoretical perspective of public diplomacy and framing theory. Through the study, the present research endeavours to examine the public diplomacy functions of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers.</b> This thesis also examines how <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> attempt to frame various controversial questions regarding China and its place in the world. The present study employs both quantitative and qualitative methods in the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers.</b> On <b>the</b> one hand, word cloud and word counter software are used to paint a general picture regarding the contents of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> on four themes of special interest have been selected for deeper, qualitative analysis: defence, human rights, China’s peaceful development and Tibet. The study shows that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> predominantly employs <b>the</b> frame of development when discussing China. Although <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> on many occasions admit the imperfection of the Chinese society, they maintain that China is constantly developing into a better society in all aspects. This frame of development is also the main thrust from the perspective of public diplomacy. The central contradiction is that while <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> promote a mutually beneficial relationship between China and other countries, they argue that China has certain, mostly territorial, entitlements due to historical reasons. Regarding territorial issues, including Tibet, the rhetoric of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> is very uncompromising. Fruitful areas for future research include the continued qualitative study of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> and <b>the</b> examination of the role of <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> in Chinese politics...|$|R

5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in <b>the</b> <b>white</b> <b>paper.</b> This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Paper</b> seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} three avenues of research. The first {{concerns}} the sense {{and objectives of}} <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> and their contribution {{to the creation of}} a European single market for private security services: we will also look at the general size of the market in Europe. The second compares and evaluates the private security industries described in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> for France, Scandinavia and Belgium. By examining administrative and economic trends, the strategies for cooperation between the private and public sectors, the law, the services and training provided, we can make a succinct evaluation of the industry for these regions from the criminological point of view. The third avenue is an analysis of the international market for private security services. The tangible changes that are taking place have led us to consider whether current ideology is still applicable or not. We also present a number of ideas for the creation of a future European scientific model for private security, given that the previously mentioned initiatives require a new approach. <b>The</b> <b>White</b> <b>Papers</b> are primarily destined to improve social dialogue between European countries as well as realising some specific objectives, but these developments leave a lot of questions unanswered...|$|R
