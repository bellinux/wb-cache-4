5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ingredient,</b> was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ingredient</b> in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ingredient,</b> was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
