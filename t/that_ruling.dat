The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of <b>that</b> <b>ruling.</b> A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1945, MacArthur {{was ordered}} to {{exercise}} authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found <b>that</b> <b>ruling</b> via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.|$|E

5|$|On February 20, 2010, Noriega's lawyers filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of the United States to block his extradition to France, after the court refused {{to hear his}} appeal the previous month. Noriega's attorneys had hoped the dissenting opinion in <b>that</b> <b>ruling,</b> written by Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, would convince the full court to take up his case, but on March 22, 2010, the Supreme Court refused to hear the petition. Two days after the refusal, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami lifted the stay that was blocking Noriega's extradition. Later that month Noriega's attorney stated that he would travel to France and try to arrange {{a deal with the}} French government.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Beshear's {{administration}} {{attempted to}} {{seize control of}} 141 gambling-related domain names {{in an attempt to}} block Kentucky residents from accessing those websites. Beshear claimed the sites were conducting illegal, unregulated gambling operations in the state and providing untaxed competition to the state's horse racing industry. Later that year, a Franklin County judge ruled that Beshear had the authority to seize the domain names, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned <b>that</b> <b>ruling</b> on appeal. Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court, partially on grounds that the web site owners were being represented by gambling associations and players groups who Beshear said had no legal standing in the case. In 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court agreed with Beshear and ordered the web site owners themselves to appear before the court. On December 23, 2015, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate ruled in favor of the state and awarded it $870 million in damages. The other party to the case, Amaya Gaming, announced they would appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, <b>that</b> <b>ruling</b> was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E

25|$|In September 2014, two courts, one {{federal and}} one state, {{produced}} contradictory rulings on {{the constitutionality of}} the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples.
