50|$|Rustication of {{a wooden}} {{exterior}} consists of three basic steps. First, the wood is cut, sanded and prepared with beveled grooves that make each plank appear {{as if it were}} a series of stone blocks. Second, the wood is <b>painted</b> with a <b>thick</b> <b>coat</b> of <b>paint.</b> Third, while the paint is still wet, sand is thrown or air blasted onto the planks until no more sand will stick. After the paint dries the plank is ready for use.|$|R
50|$|Nevill took {{possession}} of Observatory 1 December 1882 {{and found a}} <b>thick</b> <b>coat</b> of <b>paint</b> covered dome machinery making it immovable, the telescope had been erected prior to dome and had suffered from salt air and moved with difficulty, the polarising solar eyepiece was incompatible with telescope or accessories. The transit instrument was in Cape Town so a telegraph was used to relay time signal from Cape Observatory. Still, observations of the transit (in fine weather conditions) were obtained 5 days later.|$|R
50|$|By {{heating the}} full bodied paint to 60-80 deg C, it is {{possible}} to apply a <b>thicker</b> <b>coat.</b> Originally the <b>paint</b> was recirculated, but as this caused bodying up, the system was changed to direct heating on line. Hot spraying was also used with Airless and Electrostatic Airless to decrease bounce-back. Two pack materials usually had premix before tip systems using dual pumps.|$|R
50|$|More {{problems}} ensued. The ship's {{fire hoses}} had inadequate water pressure {{to fight the}} fire. One of the hoses had even been cut. Additionally, the swimming pool {{was connected to the}} fire pump system by way of an open valve which allowed the pool to fill and thereby reduced water pressure. Crewmen also had difficulty launching the lifeboats. The ropes used to lower the boats had been covered in <b>thick</b> <b>coats</b> of <b>paint,</b> causing them to jam in the winches. Even the boats that were successfully lowered had no rowlocks, and had to be paddled like canoes. By the end, only six of the 13 lifeboats were launched.|$|R
50|$|Having been {{developed}} for a separate market from typical Mazda customers, the Millenia boasted myriad finer details. It was engineered to far greater levels of perceived quality than existing Mazda cars, such as interior plastic, panel gap and <b>thicker</b> <b>paint</b> <b>coating.</b> The Millenia/Eunos 800/Xedos 9 was assembled along with the smaller Eunos 500/Mazda Xedos 6 in a new production line, presumably set up for Amati cars.|$|R

It is found that both ILSS and compressive strength of the composite degraded more in the case of unpainted specimens (coded L 0) compared to the painted ones (L 1 or L 2). Further, the specimens with a <b>thicker</b> <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> (L 2) degraded less than those with a thinner <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> (L 1) ...|$|R
5000|$|The patient work by {{clergy and}} lay people alike {{had in the}} end {{achieved}} a miracle. The chapel was 20 metres long and 9 wide and could hold about 800 people, but often {{more than a thousand}} crowded in. The walls were painted with light green crosses alternating with lilies. Special care was taken over the decoration of the east end behind the altar. The windows... had been made to look like stained glass... but in September 1941, when German clergy were separated from the others, the windows looking out on Block 28 were covered in a <b>thick</b> <b>coat</b> of white <b>paint.</b> Extract from Dachau: The Official History 1933-1945 by Paul Berben ...|$|R
25|$|The {{wall of the}} mihrab {{is covered}} with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have {{a wide variety of}} plant and {{geometric}} patterns including the stylized grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817-838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862-863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> completely <b>painted,</b> the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylized five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a motion planning method of redundant manipulator for <b>painting</b> uniform <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> {{on the interior}} of irregular duct of some aircrafts. Discontinuous peripheral painting method is employed by analyzing the restrictions during painting the duct. For improving the longitudinal uniformity of <b>thick</b> <b>coating,</b> the interlacing <b>painting</b> method plans two sets of sweeping paths and an interlacing distance between the starting paths of the two times of painting. The interlacing distance and overlapping distance are optimized by establishing and analyzing the model of longitudinal uniformity. To enhance the transverse uniformity, sweeping speeds for curved surfaces are calculated by the ratio of transfer efficiency after the basic sweeping speed for the plane is determined. The intertwining method, minimizing {{the sum of the}} weighed distances between the duct centerline and key points of the manipulator links, is employed for the joint trajectory planning without collision. The simulation and experiment results show that the redundant manipulators can finish painting the internal surface of the irregular S-shaped duct without collision. The maximum relative deviation is 16. 3 % and the thicknesses of all measurement points satisfy the acceptance criteria of the factory...|$|R
5000|$|Highroyd's owners as of 2009 {{bought the}} house in 1988 for $700,000. Heritage {{architect}} David Springett began {{to work for them}} on the restoration of the house, which involved undoing a great deal of damage and defacement that had accumulated over the years. So-called [...] "hippies" [...] had painted murals on the walls and covered the cedar staircase with a <b>thick</b> <b>coat</b> of green <b>paint.</b> Scraping the paint off the stairs was in itself a major job which took six months. The wrought iron balconies {{at the front of the}} house had been enclosed by previous owners to create more room; wrought iron for their restoration had to be made especially for the purpose. Gargoyles had to be made to decorate the spire; sculptor Hugh Reedman was commissioned for the job and produced four gargoyles that had to be lowered into position by crane.|$|R
60|$|To Bradley's {{left was}} a {{triangular}} niche in the wall {{of one of the}} houses and into this he dodged, thus concealing himself from the sight of the Wieroo. Beside him was a door painted a vivid yellow and constructed after the same fashion as the other Wieroo doors he had seen, being made up of countless narrow strips of wood from four to six inches in length laid on in patches of about the same width, the strips in adjacent patches never running in the same direction. The result bore some resemblance to a crazy patchwork quilt, which was heightened when, as in one of the doors he had seen, contiguous patches were painted different colors. The strips appeared to have been bound together and to the underlying framework of the door with gut or fiber and also glued, after which a <b>thick</b> <b>coating</b> of <b>paint</b> had been applied. One edge of the door was formed of a straight, round pole about two inches in diameter that protruded at top and bottom, the projections setting in round holes in both lintel and sill forming the axis upon which the door swung. An eccentric disk upon the inside face of the door engaged a slot in the frame when it was desired to secure the door against intruders.|$|R
60|$|Truly, {{nature and}} art had {{combined}} to produce such an effect {{from the air}} and appointments of the naturalist, as might have made him the subject of wonder in any place. His head had been industriously shaved, after the most approved fashion of Sioux taste. A gallant scalp-lock, which would probably not have been spared had the Doctor himself been consulted in the matter, was {{all that remained of}} an exuberant, and at that particular season of the year, far from uncomfortable head of hair. <b>Thick</b> <b>coats</b> of <b>paint</b> had been laid on the naked poll, and certain fanciful designs, in the same material, had even been extended into the neighbourhood of the eyes and mouth, lending to the keen expression of the former a look of twinkling cunning, and to the dogmatism of the latter, not a little of the grimness of necromancy. He had been despoiled of his upper garments, and, in their stead, his body was sufficiently protected from the cold, by a fantastically painted robe of dressed deer-skin. As if in mockery of his pursuit, sundry toads, frogs, lizards, butterflies, &c., all duly prepared to take their places at some future day, in his own private cabinet, were attached to the solitary lock on his head, to his ears, and to various other conspicuous parts of his person. If, in addition to the effect produced by these quaint auxiliaries to his costume, we add the portentous and troubled gleamings of doubt, which rendered his visage doubly austere, and proclaimed the misgivings of the worthy Obed's mind, as he beheld his personal dignity thus prostrated, and what was of far greater moment in his eyes, himself led forth, as he firmly believed, to be the victim of some heathenish sacrifice, the reader will find no difficulty in giving credit to the sensation of awe, that was excited by his appearance in a band already more than half-prepared to worship him, as a powerful agent of the evil spirit.|$|R
