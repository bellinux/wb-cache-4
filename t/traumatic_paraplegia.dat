40|$|OBJECTIVE: Comparison of {{prevalence}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} risks in persons with chronic <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia</b> {{with those in the}} general population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study. SUBJECTS: A total of 135 individuals, age range 18 - 79 years, with chronic (> or = 1 year) <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia.</b> METHODS: The prevalences of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, overweight, and smoking, were assessed in the study population and were compared with an age- and gender-matched sample of the general population in the region under study. History of myocardial infarction and medication for dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were also recorded. chi 2 tests were used to compare the paraplegic cohort with the general population sample. RESULTS: Significantly more persons with paraplegia reported a history of myocardial infarction (5. 9 %) than those in the comparison group (0. 7 %). The prevalences of diabetes mellitus (5. 9 %), dyslipidaemia (11. 1 %), and hypertension (14. 1 %) were also significantly higher in the paraplegic group, as were drug treatment for these disorders. CONCLUSION: Persons with paraplegia report increased prevalences of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia, in particular, compared with the general population. Population-based screening and therapeutic counter-measures for these conditions may therefore be particularly indicated for this patient group...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{cardiovascular}} disease {{risk factors and}} risk clusters in Swedish persons with <b>traumatic</b> wheelchair-dependent <b>paraplegia.</b> DESIGN: Prospective examination. SUBJECTS: A total of 135 individuals aged 18 - 79 years with chronic (>or= 1 year) post-traumatic paraplegia. METHODS: Cardiovascular disease risk factors; dyslipidemia, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, overweight, smoking, and medication usage for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, were analyzed according to authoritative guidelines. Stepwise regression tested the effects of age, gender, and injury characteristics on {{cardiovascular disease}} risks. RESULTS: High-prevalence risk factors were dyslipidemia (83. 1 %), hypertension (39. 3 %), and overweight (42. 2 %) with pervasive clustering of these risks. Being older was related to increased cardiovascular disease risk, except for dyslipidemia. Hypertension was more common in low-level paraplegia. Prevalence of impaired fasting glucose was lower than previously reported after paraplegia. A high percentage of persons being prescribed drug treatment for dyslipidemia and hypertension failed to reach authoritative targets for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. CONCLUSION: Swedish persons with paraplegia {{are at high risk}} for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and overweight. Impaired fasting glucose was not as common as reported in some previous studies. Pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia and hypertension often failed to achieve recommended targets. Population-based screening and therapeutic countermeasures to these cardiovascular disease risks are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Paraplegia {{and spinal}} cord {{injuries}} are issues of major concern to the actual medicine. But recent advances have raised hopes for a better prognosis, which has always been poor or infaust since medicine was practiced. However and interestingly enough, some concepts and definitions on the occurrence have survived for millennia. Once encountered as an issue, <b>traumatic</b> or non-traumatic <b>paraplegia</b> needs a multidisciplinary approach and a careful staging of the problem. Different scales are available with Frankel's and American Spinal Injury Association most widely used as alternatives or complementary tools. The authors discuss therapeutic options with a special focus on the stem cell therapy which has seen an impressive increase {{on the number of}} trials for a successful treatment. Sourcing and yielding of stem cells are made possible through a number of techniques, with material aspirated from bone marrow or adipose tissue, which are used along with other sources of neuronal precursors such as olfactory ensheathing cells.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a rare case of {{spinal cord injury}} without radiographic abnormalities (SCIWORA) associated with a traumatic aortic transection. Case Report: A 48 -year-old man was transferred for endovascular treatment of a traumatic aortic transection. Primary <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia</b> had been documented {{at the scene of}} the accident. No osseous or ligamentous injuries were found in the conventional radiographic images. The transection was treated successfully with an endovascular stent-graft, but the patient remained paraplegic. On the magnetic resonance images 8 days later, discrete trauma of the intraspinal ligament at T 1 /T 2 was seen, without signs of injury to the myelum. The patient made a slow but incomplete recovery after that. Conclusion: SCIWORA very rarely affects the thoracic spinal cord in adults; therefore, a vascular injury in relation to the trauma of the aorta is assumed. When spinal cord damage is noted after stent-grafting or open aortic surgery for traumatic transection, SCIWORA should be ruled out by history and neurological examination.

40|$|After {{a central}} nervous system (CNS) injury, there is only an "abortive regeneration" of axons, while injured axons {{regenerate}} vividly in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This difference is due, at least in part, to the existence in the periphery of Schwann cells and of growth promoting proteins they synthetize. One strategy to promote regrowth of central axons can be therefore, to modify (i. e. "peripheralize") the microenvironment by transplanting biologically active Schwann cells into the lesion site. In a rat model of <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia</b> by inflation of a subdural microballoon, we performed syngeneic transplants of Schwann cells. These cells are cultured from adult dorsal root ganglia and can be kept in vitro for several months. They are transplanted in the injured spinal cord. The grafted Schwann cells are well integrated in the host tissue without detectable inflammatory reaction. Cystic cavitation and astrogliosis are reduced in grafted animals as compared to injured, non-grafted animals. The transplant is invaded by abundant, mainly unmyelinated axons which are immunoreactive for substance P, VIP or CGRP, i. e. transmitters known {{to be present in}} DRG afferents. Supraspinal afferents containing 5 HT, TH or CCK accumulate at the rostral margin of the graft. Experimental procedures trying to stimulate the invasion of the graft by descending fibers, i. e. by inducing a chemoattraction are therefore of crucial importance for functional recovery...|$|E

The investigations into the causation of the condition revealed an occult problem: sexuality issues. with crutches if made to stand. Stress incontinence of the bladder was present. The patient was worried about achieving normality of lower limbs. He was in a dilemma about whether further investigations and possible surgery could cure him. He looked depressed and was hardly communicative. The relatives of the patient were ready to do anything including getting surgery done in a centre abroad. The patient was engaged and the family wanted to know if he could get married under the present condition. Initial advice to the patient consisted of working up the lower extremity muscles, to mobilize the stiff joints, achieving independence in activities of daily living to achieve better physical independence. Advice about decision for marriage was deferred initially for a period of about two months. In the six weeks period, the patient worked hard, muscle power improved to 3 to 3 + in lower limbs, improved his gait with crutches, was able to get up independently but with difficulty, did not report erections though signs of presence of semen in the urine were present.

40|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is an {{interruption}} of the neural pathways in the spinal canal and is characterized by muscle weakness, loss of sensation and autonomic dysfunction {{below the level of}} the lesion. The extent of these neurological deficits is determined by both the level and completeness of the lesion. A complete lesion results in loss of motor function and sensation in the lowest sacral segment whereas, following an incomplete lesion function in this segment is maintained. 1 The SCI can either have a traumatic or a non-traumatic cause. In traumatic cases, injury is typically the result of a traffic or sporting accident, but an increasing number of injuries result from a low impact fall, for example, in those with osteoporosis. 2, 3 A non-traumatic SCI may be caused by metastasis, infection and spinal haemorrhage or infarction. 3, 4 An estimated 183 new traumatic SCI occur in The Netherlands per year, of whom 154 survive hospitalization, which corresponds to an incidence of over 10 per 1, 000, 000 per year. 2 The incidence of non-traumatic SCI is easily underestimated because many are not registered as SCI, but this incidence largely exceeds the incidence of traumatic injuries. 2, 4 ‑ 6 As compared to the able-bodied population, the life expectancy of those with SCI is reduced. For example, a 20 -year-old man with a <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia</b> has an estimated life expectancy of 46 years, whereas an able-bodied man the same age, will have another 58 years to live. 3, 7 However, because the treatment of complications has improved over the past decades, the life expectancy following SCI has increased. 2 Although the life expectancy may have improved, many patients report a low level of functioning and well-being. 8 ‑ 10 Functioning following SCI may be threatened because most patients have complications, have a low physical capacity, and depend on others for daily activities. 6, 9, 11, 12 Therefore, it is important to investigate opportunities to optimize functioning following SCI...|$|E

Twenty-five male subjects with <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia,</b> the neurological levels being between T 1 and T 12, volunteered for the study. They were divided into two groups matched for age, weight and time since injury, according to the level of physical activity: 14 inactive and 11 subjects regularly involved in sports activity and considered active. They all performed a maximal spiroergometric test with an arm crank ergometer. Two samples of blood were collected for 5 -HT determination, during rest (PRE) and immediately after exercise test (POST). Serum 5 -HT concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography using electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED). the results showed that peak oxygen uptake ((V) over dot O- 2 peak) was higher in the active group (27. 08 +/- 2. 60 vs 18. 89 +/- 5. 58 mL. kg(- 1). min(- 1), P 0. 05) or POST values (275. 44 vs 311. 05 ng. mL(- 1), P> 0. 05). Both groups showed an increment in 5 -HT after maximal exercise, but only in the active group it reached statistical significance (Wilcoxon test, P< 0. 02). Our results show that chronic paraplegic individuals have normal resting serum serotonin levels and normal response to exercise. the relationship between training status, mood elevation and 5 -HT in SCI could not be established in the present study, and further investigation is needed to clarify this issue.

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) {{typically}} leads to permanent infralesional motor and sensory functional losses, pathophysiological aberrations in most organ systems and a lasting vulnerability {{for a variety}} of complicating conditions. Improvements in acute and rehabilitative management during the last decades have increased long term survival after SCI. Additionally, older persons now sustain and survive SCI. Thus, aging-related issues after SCI have arisen {{for the first time in}} history. One such issue is cardiovascular disease (CVD), which now has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects with chronic SCI. However, it is not clear whether this reflects persons with SCI constituting a true high-risk population for CVD, or whether the epidemiological shifts merely reflect a normalization of the morbidity and mortality pattern due to the current increasingly effective management of previous SCI-specific causes of disease and death in this patient population. The overall aim of the thesis was to assess and explore the need for CVD prevention after SCI, and also to compare CVD risk in this population with that of the general population. One hundred thirty-five participants (88 % of the total regional cohort), with traumatic wheelchair dependent paraplegia were assessed regarding CVD risk and was also compared with that of the general population (papers II-IV). Additionally, persons with paraplegia (n= 8 / 16) and tetraplegia (n= 8 / 16) were interviewed for the purpose of identifying facilitating factors for physical activity after SCI. Wheelchair-dependent persons with <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia</b> had an 8, 5 -fold increased prevalence of myocardial infarction as well as increased prevalence of dyslipidemia (83. 1 %), hypertension (39. 3 %) and diabetes mellitus/impaired fasting glucose (10 %). Further, 66 - 75 % of subjects were overweight according adjusted BMI scores. An extensive clustering of cardiovascular risk factors according to authority guidelines was found. From a future intervention perspective, among others the following promoting factors to increase physical activity were identified; to gain and maintain independence, accepting assistance, finding environmental solutions, learning to live with narrower margins. Further, to have a role model and to be a role model was also important. Conclusions: There is a high and increased CVD risk in persons with chronic wheelchair dependent paraplegia. Thus, regular CVD screening is indicated. CVD prevention including therapeutic lifestyle intervention needs to be developed, evaluated and then systematically implemented.

40|$|Objective: This is an {{overview}} of the cellular biology of upper nasal mucosal cells that have special characteristics that enable them to be used to diagnose and study congenital neurological diseases and to aid neural repair. Study Design: After mapping the distribution of neural cells in the upper nose, the authors' investigations moved to the use of olfactory neurones to diagnose neurological diseases of development, especially schizophrenia. Olfactory-ensheathing glial cells (OEGs) from the cranial cavity promote axonal penetration of the central nervous system and aid spinal cord repair in rodents. The authors sought to isolate these cells from the more accessible upper nasal cavity in rats and in humans and prove they could likewise promote neural regeneration, making these cells suitable for human spinal repair investigations. Methods: The schizophrenia-diagnosis aspect of the study entailed the biopsy of the olfactory areas of 10 schizophrenic patients and 10 control subjects. The tissue samples were sliced and grown in culture medium. The ease of cell attachment to fibronectin (artificial epithelial basement membrane), as well as the mitotic and apoptotic indices, was studied in the presence and absence of dopamine in those cell cultures. The neural repair part of the study entailed a harvesting and insertion of first rat olfactory lamina propria rich in OEGs between cut ends of the spinal cords and then later the microinjection of an OEG-rich suspension into rat spinal cords previously transected by open laminectomy. Further studies were done in which OEG insertion was performed up to 1 month after rat cord transection and also in monkeys. Results: Schizophrenic patients' olfactory tissues do not easily attach to basement membrane compared with control subjects, adding evidence to the theory that cell wall anomalies are part of the schizophrenic lesion of neurones. Schizophrenic patient cell cultures had higher mitotic and apoptotic indices compared with control subjects. The addition of dopamine altered these indices enough to allow accurate differentiation of schizophrenics from control patients, leading to, possibly for the first time, an early objective diagnosis of schizophrenia and possible assessment of preventive strategies. OEGs from the nose were shown to be as effective as those from the olfactory bulb in promoting axonal growth across transected spinal cords even when added 1 month after injury in the rat. These otherwise paraplegic rats grew motor and proprioceptive and fine touch fibers with corresponding behavioral improvement. Conclusions: The tissues of the olfactory mucosa are readily available to the otolaryngologist. Being surface cells, they must regenerate (called neurogenesis). Biopsy of this area and amplification of cells in culture gives the scientist a window to the developing brain, including early diagnosis of schizophrenia. The Holy Grail of neurological disease is the cure of <b>traumatic</b> <b>paraplegia</b> and OEGs from the nose promote that repair. The otolaryngologist may become the necessary partner of the neurophysiologist and spinal surgeon to take the laboratory potential of paraplegic cure into the day-to-day realm of clinical reality.
