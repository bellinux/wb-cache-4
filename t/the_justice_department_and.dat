5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> the FBI {{began by}} {{investigating}} possible criminal actions by Keating and John Granger, but then expanded its inquiries {{to include the}} five senators. The FBI soon focused their attention on Cranston, because the largest sums of money from Keating came into Cranston-involved voter-registration drives whose tax-exempt status might have been violated.|$|E
5|$|Although Congressional {{investigations}} {{focused on}} whether <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> the White House {{were using the}} U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas. On July 31, 2008, a United States district court judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> <b>and</b> tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E

During the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, ACORN's national political action committee, ACORN Votes, endorsed Barack Obama. Obama, with several other attorneys, had served as local counsel for ACORN {{more than a decade}} earlier in a 1995 voting rights lawsuit joined by <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> the League of Women Voters. Obama's campaign hired an ACORN affiliate for $800,000 to conduct a get-out-the-vote effort during that primary, but did not retain ACORN for the general presidential election.|$|E
25|$|While much of {{the debate}} focused on the law's precise language, there was {{considerable}} opposition in the Senate, almost entirely from Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson, the former speaking in defense of free speech and the latter assailing the administration for failing to use the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well. President Wilson and his Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid hearings that would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> placed it in the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality. The final vote for passage was 48 to 26 in the Senate and 293 to 1 in the House of Representatives, with the sole dissenting vote in the House cast by Meyer London of New York.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which {{believed}} that Madden was using the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA; the primary federal law governing labor relations in the U.S.) and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The NLRB and NLRA were under intense pressure from employers, the press, Congressional Republicans, and conservative Democrats. From {{the time it was}} established in August 1935, management lawyers had challenged the constitutionality of the NLRA and the authority of the NLRB to act. <b>The</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> NLRB legal staff wanted the Supreme Court to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's Lochner era legal philosophy made it unlikely that the Court would uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court. The Supreme Court eventually upheld the NLRA in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, 301 U.S. 1 (1937), and Madden personally argued the case (along with NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy and Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr., a special assistant {{in the office of the}} United States Solicitor General) before the Court. The ruling marked the Court's abandonment of Lochner era jurisprudence and led to a series of cases upholding New Deal legislation.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, former US Justice Department Civil Rights Division chief Drew S. Days III {{admitted}} {{before the}} P.R. Senate that the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI acted negligently during the 1978–1980 {{investigations of the}} Cerro Maravilla incident, such as rejecting interviews with key witnesses (including the taxi driver), refusing to offer immunity to certain witnesses, and avoiding various standard investigating tasks. Days stated: [...] "I think that certainly an apology is justified {{with respect to the}} way the federal government handled its investigation: the FBI, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> <b>and</b> my division [...] [...] [...] it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done." [...] FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990, stating: “In hindsight, the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated”. In 1984, the FBI conducted an internal review of its Cerro Maravilla Case files, and concluded that there was no cover-up effort inside the FBI, only a desire to avoid derailing [...] "the cooperative anti-terrorism effort" [...] with the Puerto Rican police. Their statements were accompanied with promises to improve their agencies to avoid similar incidents in the future.|$|E

2500|$|No activist {{is known}} to have {{conducted}} operations under both the ALF and ARM banners, but overlap is assumed. Terrorism expert Paul Wilkinson has written that the ALF, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> <b>and</b> the ARM are essentially the same thing, and Robert Garner of the University of Leicester writes that it would be pointless to argue otherwise, given the nature of the movement as a leaderless resistance. Robin Webb of the British Animal Liberation Press Office has acknowledged that the activists may be the same people: [...] "If someone wishes to act as the Animal Rights Militia or the Justice Department, simply put, the ... policy of the Animal Liberation Front, to take all reasonable precautions not to endanger life, no longer applies." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the era of}} President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, Hiss {{became a}} {{government}} attorney. In 1933, he served briefly at <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>and</b> then became a temporary assistant on the Senate's Nye Committee, investigating cost overruns and alleged profiteering by military contractors during World War I. During this period, Hiss was {{also a member of}} the liberal legal team headed by Jerome Frank that defended the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) against challenges to its legitimacy. Because of intense opposition from agribusiness in Arkansas, Frank and his left-wing assistants, who included future labor lawyer Lee Pressman, were fired in 1935 in what came to be known as [...] "the purge of liberals." [...] Hiss was not fired, but allegations that during this period he was connected with radicals on the Agriculture Department's legal team were to be the source of future controversy.|$|E
