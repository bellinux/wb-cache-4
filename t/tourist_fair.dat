Mount Antero {{is one of the}} most prominent peaks of the Sawatch Range, rising an impressive 7,200 feet above the town of Salida, Colorado to the southeast. There are two popular climbing routes on Mount Antero. The generally accepted hiking route is from the east starting at the Browns Creek Trailhead and paralleling Little Browns Creek to its upper reaches where it crosses Forest Road 1A, then following the road near to the summit. The other route, which begins near the ghost town of St. Elmo, follows the same forest road from the north up Baldwin Creek. This route has heavy mining and <b>tourist</b> traffic in <b>fair</b> weather during the summer months.|$|R
50|$|To {{solve the}} problem of silting the harbor was {{provisionally}} appointed a specialist company in Venice, which picked up the mud spilled into the open sea, but the future of the port will depend very much on the recovery of the former fruit and vegetable market now COFA abandoned, because the Chamber of Commerce of Pescara has purchased the former COFA and adjacent areas that will be retrieved and used for <b>tourist</b> accommodation facilities, <b>fairs</b> and trade. They also carried out work that will include the construction of a heliport in the marina, interventions to improve the internal structures of the harbor, dredging operations of the docks, the breakwater and restoration of the seabed and also the extension of existing docks to permit mooring of large vessels safely at a depth of about 9 meters.|$|R
40|$|The {{countryside}} of Porto Alegre is {{a particular}} space, because of its preservation, unusual for a metropolis in Brazil, and its environmental wealth. However, it is a disputed space, because those responsible for land speculation and the farmers understand it as a place with potential for different and incompatible uses. Thus, assuming that different human practices in occupied spaces have their origins in perception, this study aimed to identify and describe the perceptions of different groups of people over the countryside of Porto Alegre considering this clash that pervades the countryside and the need of biodiversity conservation. This different groups are residents {{in the metropolitan area}} of Porto Alegre among them are the respondents were goers of the Jose Bonifacio Ecological <b>Fair,</b> <b>tourists</b> who visited this countryside and people who moving to this space became "new countrysiders". Data collection was based on ethnographic techniques and analysis of data of Discourse Analysis. The results point who countryside of Porto Alegre was described as "agroecological place"; "isolated"; "quality"; "contradictions"; and "freedom". Those perceptions of the countryside to Porto Alegre are shaped by distinct life histories and contexts of rural and/or urban experiences in which urban residents are inserted...|$|R
50|$|Point Reyes Light Station was {{established}} in 1870 at Point Reyes, Calif., 19 mi from the nearest town of Inverness. It is a family station with a complement of four men who maintain a first order light, fog signal and radio beacon. The light tower itself is a sixteen-sided structure of forged iron plate (the original tower) bolted to solid rock. The top of the lantern is 37 feet (11 m) above the ground and focal plane of the light is 294 ft above sea level. To reach the light, men assigned must descend 308 steps on the headland from the plateau above the station where the family quarters are situated. The quarters are new, two-story, four-family units (four-plex) built in 1960. The four-plex contains two 2-bedroom and two 3-bedroom units. Buildings maintained on the property, {{in addition to the}} family quarters, are the fog signal building, engine room, pump house, paint locker, double garage and a four-car carport with adjoining office and workshop.Point Reyes is, by official records, the windiest and foggiest on the Pacific Coast. The station is frequently blanketed by week-long periods of fog and few years pass that do not see violent gales of 75 to 100 mph strike the area. Point Reyes Light Station is one of the District’s outstanding <b>tourist</b> attractions. On <b>fair</b> summer weekends we often have several hundred visitors logged aboard. Escorting visitors has become a major portion of the duties of men assigned. Dependent children on the station travel three miles (five kilometers) by station vehicle to school. Commissary and post exchange privileges are available at Hamilton Air Force Base (the nearest armed forces installation), or in the San Francisco area.|$|R
40|$|Research on {{community}} involvement in {{development has been}} conducted in diverse fields of study including planning, geography, community development, anthropology, and others. In the disciplines of tourism, many {{attempts have been made}} to shift from a conventional form of tourism towards a more sustainable form. Sustainable tourism calls for a greater role for local communities to engage in its planning, development, and management. The ultimate goal of community engagement in tourism is to strive for sustainable practices that balance the needs and interests of local communities with broader industry needs. Various efforts have been made, particularly in developing countries, to promote community participation and translate it from concept to practice. However, its appropriateness and success are the major points of debate among tourism practitioners and scholars. The difficult financial and economic situation facing Jordan calls for a renewed focus on how best to provide social and economic initiatives and opportunities for communities in the country. It is argued that involving local communities in tourism leads to sustainable tourism development, but surprisingly very few studies have been conducted to understand local communities’ views and their involvement in tourism in the Arab countries (Middle East Region). Using Jerash as the study area, this research examines local communities' perspectives on tourism development and prospects for improvements in community engagement in Jordan. The dissertation objectives are to: 1) to assess local views about tourism in Jerash and their interest in its success; 2) to document the type and level of prevailing local involvement in tourism; 3) to examine local perspectives on the role of the government in tourism development; 4) to examine local perspectives {{on community}} contributions to tourism. Data employed in this research were collected using mixed methods, including participant observation, household questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews. Field work was conducted during July – October 2013, and in October 2014. Results show that the tourism sector is performing at a level far below its potential. In particular, hotels and restaurants in Jerash need to be increased to meet demands from tourist and domestic visitors. Also, tourism development projects would not have been possible without the support of the local communities. Some projects were successful in providing meaningful employment to local people. The study findings conclude that residents agreed that the local community in Jerash supports tourism, and they think that tourism is an important tool to enhance and develop the community, economy, and the environment. The respondents agreed that community-oriented tourism initiatives might be one of the best solutions to solve issues such as poverty and unemployment. In addition to the lack of information about tourism development projects among local residents in their area, it was found that decisions related to tourism development were made without consultations with the local community as the level of local residents’ involvement in tourism was limited, and tourism benefits were not shared fairly among all areas in Jerash. Most residents believe that only people who are close to the archeological site are able to establish or work in tourism businesses such as restaurants, souvenir shops and <b>tourist</b> guides. A <b>fair</b> distribution of tourism benefits could be achieved if the government focused on expanding tourism development to other areas in Jerash Governorate instead of concentrating around the archeological site only. In general, the study concludes that residents support tourism and seek more tourism development in their areas...|$|R
