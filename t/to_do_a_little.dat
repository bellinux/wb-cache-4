Ben then starts to call Will [...] "Dewey" [...] (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for [...] "DWI" [...] ("Driving While Intoxicated"). Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, whom he is ashamed of. What is more, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. As she explains to Will, her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick, she decided to change her image and be nicer to [...] "people like [...] ", meaning outcasts, hoping that this good behavior would cause her dad to get well. The band members are hurt by this discovery, as it means she did not genuinely like them, but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to funding research into various extended range munitions, the navy {{is also working}} on developing railguns for use with the fleet {{at some point in}} the future. The United States Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division demonstrated an 8 MJ rail gun firing 3.2 kilogram (slightly more than 7 pounds) projectiles in October 2006 as a prototype of a 64 MJ weapon to be deployed aboard navy warships. The main problem the navy has had with implementing a railgun cannon system is that the guns wear out due to the immense heat produced by firing. Such weapons are expected to be powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more damage than a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile at a fraction of the projectile cost. Since then, BAE Systems has delivered a 32 MJ prototype to the Navy. On January 31, 2008, the US Navy tested a magnetic railgun; it fired a shell at 2520m/s using 10.64 megajoules of energy. Its expected performance is over 5800m/s muzzle velocity, accurate enough to hit a 5-meter target from [...] away while shooting at 10 shots per minute. It is expected to be ready between 2020 and 2025.|$|E

[...] Mike Wass of Idolator, while reviewing Reclassified, said that, [...] "Of the trio of fuck-you anthems, 'Iggy SZN' is the most light-hearted and upbeat.

500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
