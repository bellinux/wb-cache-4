Unfortunately, the mines rapidly deteriorated in the heat and humidity of Laos, nullifying their effectiveness. The focus of any interdiction campaign, therefore, would have to concentrate on PAVN supply transportation. The war against trucks was about to begin.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> {{distribution}} network equipment {{is closely related}} to the economy of {{distribution network}} construction. It depends on the load rate, burden rate and life expectancy rate of the equipment. Intelligent power consumption technologies {{play a significant role in}} improving <b>the</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> distribution network equipment which can reduce the construction and investment cost of distribution networks. The influence of intelligent power consumption technologies on <b>the</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> distribution network equipment is affected by a variety of factors. The key to improve <b>the</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> equipment is to take the problems of supply side and demand side into consideration comprehensively, and to make use of the intelligent power consumption technologies rationally. The corresponding evaluation indexes and their application scope are described in this paper, and the influences of intelligent power equipment with energy storage function, V 2 G technology and TOU tariff on <b>the</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> distribution network equipment have also been reviewed.|$|R
5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge {{that could have been}} provided by <b>the</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for <b>the</b> <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E

5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> perioperative prophylactic <b>utilization</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics in phacoemulsification and {{intraocular lens}} implantation patients in ophthalmology department of our hospital. METHODS: A total of 1 156 cases underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation from November, 2009 to November, 2012 in our hospital was included. Category of antibiotics, administration time point, medication time, wound healing were analyzed statistically and the rationality of above indexes was evaluated. RESULTS: All 1 156 cases received prophylactic antimicrobials by local application in the perioperative period(100 %). <b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibacterials systematically of 1 156 patients was 166 (14. 36 %); <b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibacterials systematically {{in patients with}} two systemic infection risk factors was 72. 09 %; <b>The</b> <b>utilization</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antibacterials systematically in patients with three or more systemic infection risk factors was 100 %.
