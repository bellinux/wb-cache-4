40|$|AbstractSafety and {{security}} are both qualities that concern the overall system. However, these disciplines are traditionally treated independently in the automotive domain. Replacement of classical mechanical systems with safety-critical embedded systems raised {{the awareness of}} the safety attribute and caused {{the introduction of the}} ISO 26262 standard. In contrast to this, security topics are traditionally seen as attacks of a mechanical nature and as only affecting single vehicles (e. g. door lock and immobilizer related). Due to the increasing interlacing of automotive systems with networks (such as Car 2 X), new features like autonomous driving, and online software updates, it is no longer acceptable to assume that car fleets are immune to security risks and automated remote attacks. Consequently, future automotive systems development requires appropriate systematic approaches to support cyber security and safety aware development. Therefore, this paper examines <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> techniques that are available for the automotive domain and presents an approach to classify cyber-security threats, which can be used to determine the appropriate number of countermeasures that need to be considered.

All companies within the automotive industry have strived to achieve this aspect to ensure a good reputation with its consumers. Security, however, isn’t as imperative and has led to a new field of study. For a while, safety and security were further away from each other than most would think.

Safety of the vehicle and the passenger is dramatically increased with the right security measures put in place.

Both sides also agreed on intensifying their defence technology cooperation, including in the submarine space. As well, Prime Minister Abbott called Australia a 'strong ally' of Japan. Yet, {{the prospect of a}} further strengthening of Australia–Japan defence relations has led to criticism by Australian strategic commentators. In particular, critics argue that closer strategic relations with Japan could damage Australia's ties with a rising China. In a worst-case scenario, Australia might even become 'entrapped' in a Sino-Japanese conflict. However, this argues that a closer defence relationship is in Australia's strategic interests in the face of China's increasing challenge to the rules-based order in the region. China's uncompromising position in the South China Sea and its more assertive behaviour have led to a greater congruence of <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> between Australia and Japan. Indeed, Australia and Japan are increasingly facing a security dilemma vis-à-vis China, albeit to varying degrees. Therefore, for Australia, promoting Japan's 'security normalisation' contributes to regional stability. As well, the article points out that closer strategic ties with Japan do not automatically {{come at the expense of}} Sino-Australia relations.

The President recently requested that the Vice President oversee a coordinated national effort to improve national preparedness, including efforts to combat terrorism. Federal efforts to develop a national strategy to combat terrorism and related guidance have progressed, but key efforts remain incomplete. The first step toward developing a national strategy is to conduct a national <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment.</b> The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have collaborated on such an assessment, but they have not formally coordinated with other departments and agencies on this task. Under current policy, the federal government also has improved its capabilities to respond to a domestic terrorist incident.

30|$|In recent years, the {{vulnerability}} and resilience assessment methodologies in both fields—DRM and CCA—have increasingly become more integrated (Birkmann et al. 2013). Because the CCA perspective specifically interconnects with DRM and is another top {{priority of the}} EU, the new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change (EC 2013) is addressed in this section. The goal of the strategy is to “contribute to a more climate-resilient Europe” (EC 2013, 5). Within the strategy, “adaptation” is the umbrella term used. A detailed definition of adaptation is not given, but the adaptation strategy includes a range of measures such as flood protection structures and “win–win, low-cost and no-regret adaptation options” such as early warning systems and sustainable water management (EC 2013, 5). Though in many respects imprecise, the strategy gives vulnerability as well as risk analysis a prominent and clearly defined role.
