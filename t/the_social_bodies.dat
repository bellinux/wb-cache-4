50|$|The mediaeval Spain usually {{served as}} an inspiration; Integrism did not seek a blind transferral of past institutions, but rather an {{infusion}} of their spirit into modern structures. The party rejected Liberal constitutional monarchy and despotic absolutism alike; its ideal envisioned a king which would rule and govern, with his powers executed along and limited by the Catholic principles, {{as well as by}} traditional liberties of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>bodies</b> making up the country. The very person of the king, however, posed a problem. Since there was no candidate and even no dynasty they supported, the Integrist monarch was increasingly turning into a theoretical being, with the movement gradually embracing monarchy without a king. In the 20th century the Integrists became even more ambiguous and some of them adopted accidentalism, prepared to accept a republican project.In terms of political representation the Integrists favored organicism; it envisioned a society as an organism composed of traditionally established components, like families, municipalities, provinces, institutions or professional corporations. Representation was to be exercised and channeled within and in-between these bodies, as opposed to representation exercised by means of popular elections; the latter, based on the Liberal preference for individuals, served only further atomization of the society. Since the Integros considered parliamentarian system incompatible with genuine representation, this led some scholars to conclude that they opposed universal suffrage as not democratic enough. The state itself was envisioned as a very general framework encompassing its heterogeneous components; its powers were supposed to be rather limited and necessitated only by basic practical requirements. At some point this highly regionalist vision attracted activists with pro-Basque leaning.|$|E

40|$|In May 2010, a {{delegation}} of Papua New Guinean politicians travelled to a remote village on the country&# 039;s north coast to receive a petition against proposed mine activity. The encounter between the politicians and the villagers who had invited them involved two very different articulations of power and authority, and two competing cartographies of centrality and marginality. The encounter speaks {{to the need to}} approach the concepts of custom and modernity not only as powerful discourses which are taken up and performed in local places, but also as analytical descriptors of actually existing patterns of practice and meaning which are structurally and ontological distinct. At the same time, however, analysis of the encounter between villagers and politicians makes clear that this structural difference cannot be written straightforwardly onto <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>bodies</b> of opposing collectivities.

40|$|International audienceThe Cotswold Games are poetical jousts, {{the heroes}} of which are the {{contributors}} to Annalia Dubrensia, who borrowed from classical Greece its literary style, which {{was associated with the}} royal policy aiming at persuading the élites {{to go back to their}} demesnes to control <b>the</b> masses. <b>Social</b> control rested as much on the internalization of obedience as on physical coercion, and the Games depict a pre-Puritan, socially and economically harmonious England. Therefore, Dover might have staged sports because of Puritan opposition to seasonal feasts of which his Games were an outgrowth, or because Puritanism questioned the common religion underlying the so-called Merry England. The secular derived its legitimacy and cohesion from the sacred as illustrated by the Corpus Christi cycle that represented society as body, and linked one's psychosomatic self to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>body,</b> whose wholeness was therefore to be protected, to the body of Christ.

40|$|Many social {{researchers}} mistakenly {{think that}} Mead {{had no interest}} in the body and the emotions of the human being. They seem to think that his <b>social</b> philosophy of <b>the</b> act is all about her mind. This is unfortunate since his idea of the significance of the body and emotions for the emergence and development of the self is of great relevance to the contemporary interest in the subject matter. First, this article presents Mead’s contribution to the area. Especially it considers his idea of emotions as a form of intersubjective corporeality. Secondly, to better fulfil Mead’s own wish to transcend the Cartesian mind-body dualism it reconstructs his idea of emotions by relating them not only to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>body</b> of <b>the</b> human being, but also the structures of norms and values embodied in social life.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the body and about how medical discourses conceptualise the body in health and in illness. However, any {{inquisitiveness}} about the body is determined by historical, social and political environment that nurtures the discursive formations of knowledge. I focus particularly on the conceptualisation {{of the body in}} the two distinct medical traditions of Western and Chinese medicine. I examine Michel Foucault's analysis on the medical gaze and on the external technologies of power deployed on the body of the individual and on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>body.</b> <b>The</b> knowledge generated from the medical gaze is articulated through a normalising and prescriptive discourse. The gaze of Chinese medicine that looks at the workings of the cosmos to define the truth about the body generates similar authoritative knowledge that targets the individual and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>body.</b> However, this effect of power, although it never disappears entirely, undergoes significant transformations when it enters the arena of human activities and the potential for improvisation in the behaviour of the human actor. There is always a gap between the text and the practice...|$|R
