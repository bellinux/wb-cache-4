5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E

Shortly after his return, Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed by Diane Martel in Copake, NY in upstate New York during August1993. It {{features}} a cameo appearance by Carey's dog Jack, and shows her frolicking through a flowerbed and field, {{swimming in a}} large pond, boarding a hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. According to author Chris Nickson, the video's carefree setting harmonized well with the song's soft instrumentation. Due to the song's strong radio airplay and extended charting, the video received frequent play on several music video channels <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1993.|$|E
5|$|<b>Throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer,</b> William {{assembled}} an {{army and}} an invasion fleet in Normandy. Although William of Jumièges's {{claim that the}} ducal fleet numbered 3,000 ships is clearly an exaggeration, it was probably large and mostly built from scratch. Although William of Poitiers and William of Jumièges disagree about where the fleet was built– Poitiers states it was constructed {{at the mouth of}} the River Dives, while Jumièges states it was built at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme– both agree that it eventually sailed from Valery-sur-Somme. The fleet carried an invasion force that included, in addition to troops from William's own territories of Normandy and Maine, large numbers of mercenaries, allies, and volunteers from Brittany, northeastern France, and Flanders, together with smaller numbers from other parts of Europe. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing. Harold kept his forces on alert <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer,</b> but with the arrival of the harvest season he disbanded his army on 8September.|$|E

5|$|After Austerlitz, Napoleon {{established}} the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection of German states intended {{to serve as}} a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{influence}} {{began to}} wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism, {{which led to}} the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, the celebration of the birthday of Gautama Buddha. Cẩn's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the military junta, which tried and executed him in 1964.|$|E
