5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E

A pair of external shoulders, {{one of which is}} axially displaceable relative to the other, and a rigid tubular sleeve interposed between said shoulders are included. Tension is applied to the elastic body for imparting strain. The movable shoulder can be advanced into abutting engagement with the sleeve, whereby the sleeve is placed in compression once the <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> are removed from the shanks.

2500|$|Prestressing {{concrete}} is {{a technique}} that greatly increases the load-bearing strength of concrete beams. The reinforcing steel in the bottom part of the beam, which will be subjected to tensile forces when in service, is placed in tension before the concrete is poured around it. Once the concrete has hardened, the tension on the reinforcing steel is released, placing a built-in compressive force on the concrete. When loads are applied, the reinforcing steel takes on more stress and the compressive force in the concrete is reduced, but does not become a <b>tensile</b> <b>force.</b> [...] Since the concrete is always under compression, it is less subject to cracking and failure.|$|E
2500|$|A rod {{is usually}} also {{classified}} by the optimal weight of fishing line {{or in the}} case of fly rods, fly line the rod should handle. Fishing line weight is described in pounds of <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> before the line parts. Line weight for a rod is expressed as a range that the rod is designed to support. Fly rod weights are typically expressed as a number from 1 to 12, written as [...] "N"wt (e.g. 6wt.) and each weight represents a standard weight in grains for the first 30 feet of the fly line established by the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturing Association. For example, the first 30' of a 6wt fly line should weigh between 152-168 grains, with the optimal weight being 160 grains. In casting and spinning rods, designations such as [...] "8-15 lb. line" [...] are typical.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{force can}} provide a source of energy used by a desired {{chemical}} reaction. To create such materials, mechanically sensitive chemical groups called mechanophores are built into the chemical structure of the polymer. In one set of experiments, researchers used spiropyran molecules to detect mechanical stress. The spiropyran (SP) mechanophore was covalently bonded into a stretchy barbell-shaped polymer called polymethyl acrylate (PMA) and a small, glasslike bead-shaped polymer called polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). SP transformed into a fluorescent merocyanine (MC) form in response to stress. [...] The orientation of the MC subspecies relative to the <b>tensile</b> <b>force</b> could be characterized based on the anisotropy of the fluorescence polarization. [...] Spiropyrans were normally colorless but turned vivid shades of red or purple when stressed. They also fluoresce. The researchers have also demonstrated that mechanical force can power a chemical response in the polymer, changing the covalent bonding. A next step in this research is to explore the potential to use mechanochemical reactions to activate chemical pathways in materials to respond to shock waves in positive ways, by altering or enhancing properties of the material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce a simple experimental apparatus based on the applied forces for quantitative assessment on hot tearing behavior in aluminum alloys. According to the experimental procedure, molten metal is cast in the rod-shaped mold cavity. One side of the casting specimen is hooked by a steel bolt which restrains its free contraction and transfers the <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> during solidification. A steel threaded rod connected to a load cell which records the real-time measurement of the <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> during every experiment. Thermal history is monitored by K-type thermocouple. The data of the temperature and <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> are acquired by a data acquisition system. Test of the experimental apparatus is conducted with A 356 and Al- 5 wt%Cu alloy to investigate the accuracy of the experimental apparatus and modify its operating parameter. The <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> curves and the temperature curves of the specimens are obtained by experiment. This data provide useful information about hot tearing formation and solidification characteristics, from which their quantitative relations are derived. In this manner, the hot tearing behavior in aluminum alloys can be studied by this experimental apparatus based on the applied forces...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: In {{strengthened}} RC members {{the distribution}} of cross sectional <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> {{is affected by the}} significant differences in bond behavior of the reinforcement layers. As the <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> in the externally bonded reinforcement is the essential input value for bond verification for example at the end anchorage, the detailed knowledge of {{the distribution of}} forces in cracked sections is of fundamental importance. In this paper the common models to describe the interactions in tensile members are summarized and an advanced numerical model based on nonlinear bond stress-slip relationships for strengthened flexural members is presented. On the basis of experimental results combined with parametric studies, the effects of various parameters – for example the axial stiffness of CFRP, the diameter of internal rebars or the concrete compressive strength – on the interactions between the different reinforcement layers are examined. For practical design bond coefficients for a simplified calculation of cross sectional <b>tensile</b> <b>forces</b> are proposed...|$|R
