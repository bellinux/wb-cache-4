In {{responding}} to certain situations, particularly during earlier seasons, Stan often exclaims [...] "Dude, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> fucked up right here". While Stan is cynical and profane, Parker still notes that there is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] to the character, and Time magazine described Stan and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by bodily functions and toilet humor, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.|$|E
2500|$|Twente won 16 of 17 home {{matches in}} the Eredivisie league that season and lost just two away. Twente {{withstood}} immense pressure from Martin Jol's Ajax (who won their last 14 {{games in a}} row and had a goal difference of +86, more than double Twente's +40) {{during the second half of}} the season and trumped the Amsterdam side by one point difference on the last day of the league to claim the title. Upon winning the championship, McClaren stated, [...] "Winning the Carling Cup with Middlesbrough was special but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much right up at the top of anything I've ever done. To win a championship in a foreign country with foreign coaches, I think it's made me stronger." ...|$|E
2500|$|... he Elo {{equivalent}} of a given handicap degrades as you go down the scale. A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the [...] "weak" [...] player is around IM level, but it drops as you go down. For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and I would put the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) with me at around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level. An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more. When {{you get down to}} the level of the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2005, the group convened in a collaboration with Castle Music to decide on songs for a retrospective. Juggernaut Rides '89–'98 compiled 33 tracks remastered from the original DATs (almost half of which being non-album tracks) and was released on 14 March 2005. The two-CD anthology featured four previously unreleased songs, including Shake Appeal's [...] "Son of Mustang Ford" [...] demo from 1989 and the remainder of Swervedriver's 1998 recordings, [...] "Just Sometimes" [...] and the orchestral string accompanied [...] "Neon Lights Glow". Regarding the production effort for Juggernaut Rides, Franklin told Tape Op magazine, [...] "Me and Jimmy sat there [...] and said, 'Wow <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> great.' You do forget things about the various tracks," [...] and said to Australia's The Vine, [...] "I quite {{like the fact that}} it’s not chronologically laid out, so you just jump straight into the middle." [...] Reviews touted it as [...] "Swervedriver's beautiful corpse" [...] and asserted that it [...] "proves they were so much more than just another underachieving T-shirt band." ...|$|E

And even if not, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> sweet as is. Theon Weber from The Village Voice concluded that [...] " [...] has a huge talent for drama—when to build, when to break, when to whisper or coo or yell, when to camp a while in a looping melody and when to move on—and the album's 37 minutes feel majestic and unhurried." [...] Luke Winkie of musicOMH praised Anderson for her [...] "brilliant, visceral talent for stormy melodies and untouchable lyrical knack" [...] {{and concluded that the}} album contained [...] "some of the most stirring lyrical turns of the year." [...] Laura Studarus, a writer from Under the Radar, described the album as [...] "a skittering trip through the displaced troubadour’s disjointed existence. Rachel Harris from Clash feels that the record [...] "will leave you bewitched and bewildered." [...] Benjamin Boles from NOW described the album as [...] "not always the most comfortable thing to listen to, but like the proverbial car crash, it’s hard to tear yourself away." [...] Andrew Baer of No Ripcord found the album to be [...] "an overall cohesive success", but he felt that the record owed its [...] "quality to the unwavering confidence of [...] delivery, both musically and lyrically." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> plain speaking, and Terrae Filius enforces, by an {{historical}} example, {{the dangers of}} even political freethought. In 1714 the Constitution Club kept King George's birthday.

The Conservative undergraduates attacked the club, sallying forth from their Jacobite stronghold in Brasenose (as seen in our illustration), where the [...] "silly statue," [...] as Hearne calls it, was about that time erected. The Whigs took refuge in Oriel, the Tories assaulted the gates, and an Oriel man, firing out of his window, wounded a gownsman of Brasenose. The Tories, [...] "under terror of this dangerous and unexpected resistance, retreated from Oriel." [...] Yet such was the academic strength of the Jacobites and the Churchmen, that a Freethinker, or a [...] "Constitutioner," [...] could scarcely take his degree.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--You {{will have}} no letter at all this month and it is really not my fault. I have been saving my hand as much as {{possible}} for Davy Balfour; only this morning I was getting on first rate with him, when about half-past nine there came a prick {{in the middle of the}} ball of my thumb, and I had to take to the left hand and two words a minute. I fear I slightly exaggerate the speed of my left hand; about a word and a half in the minute--which is dispiriting to the last degree. Your last letter with the four excellent reviews and the good news about The Wrecker was particularly welcome. I have already written to Charles Baxter about the volume form appearance of The Beach of Falesá. In spite of bad thumbs and other interruptions I hope to send to Baxter by this mail the whole first part (a good deal more than half) of David Balfour ready for press. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> satisfactory, and I think ought to put us beyond the reach of financial catastrophe for the year.|$|E

I lie; there has come one, {{and that in the}} pocket of a missionary man who is at daggers drawn with me, who lends it to all my enemies, conceals it from all my friends, and is {{bringing}} a lawsuit against me on the strength of expressions in the same which I have forgotten, and now cannot see. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> tragic, I think you will allow; and I was inclined to fancy it was the fault of the Post Office. But I hear from my sister-in-law Mrs. Sanchez that she is in the same case, and has received no 'Footnote.' I have also to consider that I had no letter from you last mail, although you ought to have received by that time 'My Grandfather and Scott,' and 'Me and my Grandfather.' [...] Taking one consideration with another, therefore, I prefer to conceive that No. 743 Broadway has fallen upon gentle and continuous slumber, and is become an enchanted palace among publishing houses. If it be not so, if the 'Footnotes' were really sent, I hope you will fall upon the Post Office with all the vigour you possess. How does THE WRECKER go in the States? It seems to be doing exceptionally well in England. - Yours sincerely, ...|$|E
