500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{departure}} from other popular titles such as Square Enix's Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. Both the graphical presentation and the soundtrack were very well received. Reviews also commented that, initially, the character designs were too similar to previous Square Enix titles {{and may be}} off-putting to some though in the Shibuya setting they were [...] "absolutely in their element." [...] Some reviewers also complained that the Stride Cross Battle System was too complex for new players; Eurogamer's review felt the [...] "sink or swim" [...] reliance on learning the complex battle system was a significant stumbling block for the game. GamePro noted that the stylus input was imprecise, often mistaking movement and attack actions. On the other hand, the system was praised for its approach, and for the ability to alter {{the difficulty of the}} system within the game. Neku Sakuraba's character arc was praised by several reviewers, such as G4TV editor Jonathan Hunt, who praised his growth from a [...] "mute teenager" [...] to a [...] "civil human". 1UP.com's review summarized that the game is much {{more than the sum of}} its parts: [...] "By all rights, The World Ends With You should be an annoying disaster, a bundle of tired gimmicks and trite clichés. Yet somehow all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> be unbearable fall into place and create a game that's far more unique, interesting, and addictive than it has any right to be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because the {{composition}} and writing of BoA's songs is handled mostly by her staff, BoA has been criticized as being a [...] "manufactured pop star". In response to such criticism, BoA said that [...] "if one person were to force their own will on something, then <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> have gone right could easily go wrong" [...] and that she is [...] "not all that unhappy with the expression that [...] a manufactured star. In a way, that is true. Because SM Entertainment created the environment and all the surrounding conditions, [...] able {{to be successful in}} the way [...] now." [...] Though her earlier releases were marked by a [...] "cute" [...] and [...] "youthful" [...] style, BoA began to present a more [...] "mature" [...] image starting from the album My Name. In a Talk Asia interview, Anjali Rao noted that some felt that My Name marked the beginning of BoA's decline in popularity and asked if the public would always see the singer as [...] "Little Baby BoA"; BoA replied, [...] "So while I apologize to those people who still want the baby BoA, in fact, what can I do? I just keep growing up! I can't stop that from happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Charter {{has enjoyed}} {{a great deal of}} popularity, with 82% of Canadians {{describing}} it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999, the document has also been subject to published criticisms {{from both sides of the}} political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel, who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy. Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights. He has argued that there are several <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> be included in the Charter, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians. The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity, such as the [...] "right to strike".|$|E
