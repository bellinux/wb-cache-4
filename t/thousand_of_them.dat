5|$|Wallace {{collected}} {{more than}} 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> represented species new to science. One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip {{is that of the}} gliding tree frog Rhacophorus nigropalmatus, known as Wallace's flying frog. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.|$|E

Three more forts were under {{construction}} {{on the eastern side}} of the East River to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights. These new fortifications were Fort Putnam (named for Rufus Putnam and not to be confused with the later Fort Putnam at West Point), Fort Greene (named for Nathanael Greene), and Fort Box (named for Major Daniel Box). They lay from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest. Each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch, all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons (mostly 18-pounders).|$|E

They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo.

They belong to eight or nine species, depending on the taxonomic school. Apart from the 5,000 cultivated varieties, there are about 200 wild species and subspecies, many of which can be cross-bred with cultivated varieties. Cross-breeding has been done repeatedly to transfer resistances to certain pests and diseases from the gene pool of wild species to the gene pool of cultivated potato species. Genetically modified varieties have met public resistance in the United States and in the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle for}} the Qatrabbul Gate had been a massive victory for the Baghdadis. Of the four {{thousand}} Samarrans stationed {{on the western side}} of the city, two <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been killed, with several of their heads being hung around Baghdad, and many others were taken prisoner. In Samarra, news of the defeat was met with rioting; many among the populace apparently considered the battle to be a sign of the weakness of al-Mu'tazz's forces. Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, however, refused to follow up on his victory. Rejecting the council of his advisors to press his advantage and pursue the fleeing soldiers, his only order after the battle was to have proclamation of victory drawn up and read in the Jama Mosque of the Round City. Meanwhile, Abu Ahmad's army, which is not mentioned as having participated in the battle that day, remained encamped on the eastern side. As a result, the siege of the city continued.|$|E
25|$|During the Second Empire, {{foreign and}} {{mercenary}} soldiers {{became an important}} part of the Bulgarian army and its tactics. Since the very beginning of the rebellion of Asen and Peter, the light and mobile Cuman cavalry was effectively used against the Byzantines and later the Crusaders. For instance, fourteen <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were used by Kaloyan in the battle of Adrianople. The Cumans were the empire's most effective military component. The Cuman leaders entered the ranks of Bulgarian nobility, and some of them received high military or administrative posts in the state. During the 14th century the Bulgarian army increasingly relied on foreign mercenaries, which included Western knights, Mongols, Ossetians or came from vassal Wallachia. Both Michael III Shishman and Ivan Alexander had a 3,000-strong Mongol cavalry detachment in their armies. In the 1350s, Emperor Ivan Alexander even hired Ottoman bands, as did the Byzantine Emperor. Russians were also hired as mercenaries.|$|E

25|$|By early 1659, Abaza Hasan's {{army was}} {{suffering}} greatly {{from lack of}} supplies in the unusually harsh winter. In response to the increasingly vocal complaints coming from his troops, including the open defection of several <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to the loyalist side, he accepted the impossibility of his victory and opened negotiations with Murtaza Pasha, using the Mufti of Ayntab as an intermediary. In exchange for vows of safety and pardon, he and his top commanders agreed to surrender and enter the city of Aleppo, while their army remained encamped outside. The rebels were then lodged in the mansions of the loyalist pashas, with Abaza Hasan residing with Murtaza. The two sides conversed cordially {{over the course of}} several days, and drafted letters to be sent to the capital, asking for pardon for the rebels. Despite this, at the time of the night prayer on 16 February 1659, the loyalists carried out a plot to murder their unsuspecting guests. While Abaza Hasan was preparing for prayer by performing ablutions, assassins approached and cut his throat from behind. A cannon was then fired from the Aleppo Citadel, indicating to the other pashas that it was time to massacre the remaining rebel leaders.|$|E
25|$|Concretely, Tunisian {{women are}} very {{involved}} in society, as they represent 58.1 per cent of students in higher education. They work in all trades, in the army, in civil and military aviation and in the police. They represent 72 per cent of pharmacy workers, 42 per cent in medicine, 27 per cent of magistrates, 31 per cent of lawyers and 40 per cent of university professors. In total, in 2004 they constituted 26.6 per cent of the work force, although in 1989 they had only represented 20.9 per cent and a mere 5.5 per cent in 1966. Furthermore, from 1999 to 2004 job creation grew 3.21 per cent for women, {{with an average of}} 19,000 created each year. Moreover, the illiteracy rate of women ten years and older declined from 96.6 per cent in 1956 to 58.1 per cent in 1984 to 42.3 per cent in 1994 to 31 per cent in 2004; the masculine rate in 2004 was 21.2 per cent. This is explained primarily {{by the fact that the}} number of girls per one hundred boys in primary school was 52 in 1965 and 83 in 1989. Furthermore, in the absence of the equity law, they represented 14.89 per cent of the members of government, 22.75 per cent (43 of 189) of the deputies of the House elected on October 24, 2004, 27.06 per cent of municipal councillors and 18 per cent of the members of the economic and social council. In addition, between ten thousand and fifteen <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are business leaders.

25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory.
