5|$|Druitt's {{father died}} {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £ today). In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received very little money, if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions. Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.|$|E
5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{reform to}} income tax {{deductions}} allowed high income earners <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> more for private insurance. Although this reform {{was intended to}} decrease overconsumption of health care services, it had the side effect of more regressive financing of public health services. Nevertheless, that same year payroll taxes were completely phased out while higher indirect taxes (on excise goods such as alcohol and tobacco) were earmarked for health care.|$|E

However, some supplies are exempt (without a credit for input tax), which means that such supplies fall entirely outside the scope of the VAT Act. Businesses that only have such supplies cannot register for VAT, and are not entitled <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> VAT. Financial services, health services, social services and educational services are all outside the scope of the VAT Act.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has no incentive to disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an invoice quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the VAT registration number of the supplier.|$|E
25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> the home mortgage interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax). Home mortgage interest {{is one of the few}} personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home mortgage interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E

The presence of an exothermic event can then be used to assess the stability of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown activation energy, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to suggest a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter, but such a test may take 2–3 days from ambient at a rate of a 3 °C increment per half-hour.|$|E
25|$|Iowa imposes {{taxes on}} net state income of individuals, estates, and trusts. There are nine income tax brackets, ranging from 0.36% to 8.98%, {{as well as}} four {{corporate}} income tax brackets ranging from 6-12%, giving Iowa the country's highest marginal corporate tax rate. The state sales tax rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax. Iowa has one local option sales tax that may be imposed by counties after an election. Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property. Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed {{by more than one}} taxing authority. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, school district and special levies. Iowa allows its residents <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> their federal income taxes from their state income taxes.|$|E
25|$|Ian Narev, {{the current}} CEO, was the Group Head of Strategy, with {{responsibility}} for corporate strategy development, mergers and acquisitions and major cross- business strategic initiatives. He led the Group’s $2.1 billion acquisition of Bankwest in 2008, and developed the strategy outlined below. The Share Sale Deed provisions provided the CBA at clauses 4 & 10 with price adjustment provisions. The Warranty Clauses are, 15.1, 15.3, 16.1, 16.2, schedule 6 cl 5.1 and clause 12 (c) of the Share Sale Deed provided the CBA with a $4 billion short term loan {{in support of the}} Warranty Clauses. (Refer the Share Sale Deed and the December 2015 CBA testimony to the PJC).

30|$|Corporate tax is {{determined}} by the statutory tax rate times taxable income. The Spanish legislator reduced the statutory tax rate from 32.5  % for fiscal year 2007 to 30  % for fiscal years 2008 – 2013. On the other hand, corporate taxable income is defined as the difference between period revenues and period expenses. 5 Business expenses are deductible if they are properly recorded and supported. By contrast with other countries, Spanish corporate income tax treats income resulting from the transfer of assets {{in the same way as}} other income. Accordingly, such income is generally added <b>to</b> (<b>deducted</b> from) regular business income to compute the taxable income.|$|R
50|$|Nearly all jurisdictions {{that tax}} {{business}} income allows deductions {{for business and}} trade expenses.

30|$|Under the {{progressive}} income tax system, we should coordinate every tax level. The amount <b>to</b> be <b>deducted</b> from individual {{wages and salaries}} has increased multiple times. Now, it {{is the time to}} reduce the tax burden on incomes such as laborers’ wages and author’s fees. In September 2011, the government further increased the standard amount <b>to</b> be <b>deducted</b> from wages and salaries, effectively reducing taxes on low- and middle-income individuals while increasing taxes on higher income individuals. This has caused some high-income individuals to move to other countries or regions, thus reducing China’s potential taxation revenue. If the highest marginal tax rate were reduced, tax revenues thus gained could be used to help lower income groups.|$|R
25|$|The {{incomes of}} the poorest {{sections}} of society were increased exponentially {{as a result of}} social security reforms and a 25% increase in the minimum wage. Allowances for the handicapped were also increased, while the right <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> the cost of child care for all {{children under the age of}} three was introduced (a right later extended to include all children under the age of five in some cases). Unemployed workers ineligible for jobless benefits were given back the right to claim sickness insurance that they had lost in 1979 while the reimbursal of the costs of dental fees, hearing aids, and glasses was improved. An 80-franc-per-month charge that had been imposed on certain long-term illnesses was abrogated, and certain individuals who had retired before 1973 had the base upon which their pensions were calculated adjusted upward. Between 1981 and 1983, the minimum vieillesse (the basic pension benefit for the elderly poor) was raised by 62%.|$|E
25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E

50|$|For the {{purposes}} of calculating the amount of income subject to garnishments, United States' federal law defines disposable income as an individual's compensation (including salary, overtime, bonuses, commission, and paid leave) after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required <b>to</b> be <b>deducted</b> by law. Amounts required <b>to</b> be <b>deducted</b> by law include federal, state, and local taxes, state unemployment and disability taxes, social security taxes, and other garnishments or levies, but does not include such deductions as voluntary retirement contributions and transportation deductions.

25|$|Seventh, some {{scholars}} {{point out that}} the Beck ruling may lead to unanticipated outcomes. At least one commentary on Beck concludes that Beck rights, if successfully implemented, may lead large numbers of workers to resign from a union during a strike. These workers will be able to continue to work during a strike (incurring none of the disadvantages a strike brings), and yet will still be able to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining (assuming the strike is successful and an agreement is negotiated). The strike is the most powerful weapon unions have, and undermining the union's ability to strike would put labor unions at a distinct disadvantage in collective bargaining. The NLRB and Supreme Court have acknowledged the role that agency fee payers can play in undermining strikes. In NLRB v. Textile Workers Union, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that once a union member had resigned, the union could not punish that worker for crossing picket lines. And in Pattern Makers' League v. NLRB, (as noted above) the Court said unions must permit members to resign at any time. Decisions like these have informed the NLRB's rulings on the issue as well. The Board found that an employer did not commit an unfair labor practice when it distributed notices to employees prior to a strike that outlined an employee's rights during a strike (including the right to become an agency fee payer and cross picket lines). The Board also held that, once a single employee has inquired about their right to become an agency fee payer, it is legal for an employer to notify all workers about this right. But {{in the absence of an}} employee-initiated iniquiry, it is not, the Board says, legal for employers to approach striking workers and ask them to become agency fee payers. The negative implications of widespread worker resignation from unions prior to or during a strike is clear, some argue. This may be changing, however, as more unions turn away from strikes and toward comprehensive campaigns. It is also unclear how Beck may impact dues checkoff (an agreement between the employer, union, and employee under which the employer agrees <b>to</b> <b>deduct</b> union dues directly from the employee's paycheck and turn it over to the union). In 1991, the NLRB held that dues checkoff agreements create an obligation to pay dues in the same way that becoming a union member does. It is possible that Beck and subsequent rulings could also undermine dues checkoff agreements.|$|E
