40|$|Taiwan is {{involved}} in intelligent <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> planning, and is now selecting its prior focus areas for investment and development. The high social and economic impact associated with which intelligent <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> technology are chosen explains the efforts of various electronics and transportation corporations for developing intelligent <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> technology to expand their business opportunities. However, {{there has been no}} detailed research conducted with regard to selecting technology for advanced public <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> in Taiwan. Thus, the present paper demonstrates a grey statistics method integrated with a scenario method for solving the problem of selecting advanced public <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> technology for Taiwan. A comprehensive questionnaire survey was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the grey statistics method. The proposed approach indicated that contactless smart card technology is the appropriate technology for Taiwan to develop in the near future. The significance of our research results implies that the grey statistics method is an effective method for selecting advanced public <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> technologies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} how the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and services are supporting different types of freight transportation related (FTR) information through the transportation networks. The other purpose is to identify the types of functions and the types of FTR information that are supported by such systems and the values and benefits that are created for actors of the transportation networks by using such systems. A literature study was conducted to identify the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and its elements. Documents of more than 65 companies working on the area of smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> are studied as a source of empirical data to provide a complete list of the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and services. Semi-structured interviews with representatives of the companies are conducted to understand the types of the FTR information that are supported by smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> and functions that are carried out by using such information. The results of this study show that only some of the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> are supporting the FTR information and majority of the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> are used in the urban transport sector. Information related to the location of the freight through the transportation network is the most supported FTR information after using the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> according to this study. The results of this study are useful for information operators in companies to identify effect of using the smart <b>transportation</b> <b>systems</b> on performance of their transportation networks...|$|R

When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E
