Each series was released periodically, culminating in a complete boxed set. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> in the packaging of each series was the varying colours of the Press Gang logo, which matched the disc menu.|$|E

5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
5|$|Three {{additional}} HC Mk2 Chinooks {{were ordered}} with delivery beginning in 1995. Another six were ordered in 1995 under the Chinook HC Mk2A designation; <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between these {{and the standard}} Mk2 was the strengthening of the front fuselage to allow the fitting of an aerial refuelling probe in future.|$|E
5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around their shoulders. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E

5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between Argentina {{and other}} settler {{societies}} such as Australia and Canada was {{its failure to}} seek adequate alternatives {{to compensate for the}} end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> to the original FreeBSD is that they come with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use the same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 {{members of the}} European Parliament (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected {{them as part of}} the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the legislation are very similar to the parliamentary-election legislation, with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between the two machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E
5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> in the anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the}} first two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto security systems, or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies they must be revived before the level can be completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects {{similar to that of}} the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between {{eukaryotic}} and prokaryotic {{oxidative phosphorylation}} is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} the teams' passing {{remained}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between them; however, in the 16thminute, Barcelona lost the ball and Ryan Giggs sent a long ball forward to Ronaldo. Ronaldo's first touch took him inside Piqué before going back outside the former Manchester United defender, who cynically blocked Ronaldo's run, earning himself the first yellow card of the match. Ronaldo shaped to take the free kick himself, but it was Giggs who shot for goal, only to curl the ball just over the bar.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in procreation).|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources do {{not give}} {{reliable}} data on the size and composition of Harold's army, although two Norman sources give figures of 1.2million or 400,000 men. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5000 and 13,000 for Harold's army at Hastings, but most agree {{on a range of}} between 7000 and 8000 English troops. These men would have comprised a mix of the fyrd (militia mainly composed of foot soldiers) and the housecarls, or nobleman's personal troops, who usually also fought on foot. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>difference</b> between the two types was in their armour; the housecarls used better protecting armour than that of the fyrd. The English army {{does not appear to have}} had many archers, although some were present. The identities of few of the Englishmen at Hastings are known; the most important were Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine. About 18 other named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including two other relatives.|$|E
