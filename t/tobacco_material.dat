40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} an integrated control approach for discrete event systems in industry. The integrated control involves two levels: basic control functions (PLC level) and higher supervision (SCADA Level). The considered discrete event system {{consists of three}} main groups: a chain of conveyors and a moving carriage to charge the <b>tobacco</b> <b>material</b> into silos (charging group), set of silos for temporary storage (silos group), and a chain of conveyors to discharge the material (discharging group). The system is analyzed using a sequential function chart (Grafcet tool) and discrete models are developed for both PLC level and SCADA level. Based on the developed model, a new control panel is designed using a PLC. The developed system is equipped by an industrial PC to visualize the industrial operation {{and to make the}} operator interact easily with the controlled system. The new system has the advantages of: high reliability in function operation, minimal downtime, and fault diagnosis capability in system components. The system is tested in applying standard commissioning procedures to ensure the quality and safety operation for the developed control panel. This application is running successfully and the required control objectives are maintained *. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these tests {{is an attempt to}} {{contribute}} to new technology of plantlet (Todd's Cells) in mass production for developing economical, safer and quality tobacco production. The study includes two ways of plantlet production and three varieties of Virginia Species Tobacco. The results of parallel testing of tobacco production obtained from plantlets of different origins have shown that the new way of breeding has many advantages. Todd's Cells plantlet was ready for transplantation earlier and it reached the technological maturity in the open field earlier than usual. The time necessary for leaves drying was shorter in 12 hours and so the later processings (redrying, cigarettes production) were done in a shorter time. The plants in the field were more resistant to disease agents because Todd's Cells plantlets had easier adjusted to the environmental conditions. Tobacco leaf yield from Todd's Cells was significantly higher than from the traditionally produced plantlet. Raw material quality was also better. At the end. it is important to line out that the different plantlet production methods of different varieties reacted differently to yield and raw <b>tobacco</b> <b>material</b> quality...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -The topical {{carcinogenicity}} to mouse skin {{of smoke}} condensates ob-tained from a tobacco substitute (NSM), {{alone or in}} combination with tobacco, has been compared with condensate from tobacco and with acetone, the solvent used. Sixteen different types of cigarette were {{used to make the}} condensates, and the age-standardized results have been analysed according to the Weibull distribution model. The results show that NSM condensate has less than 25 % of the potency of tobacco condensate (37 0 at 95 0 upper confidence limit), and that condensates from blends of NSM and tobacco are similarly reduced in activity. General pathology analysis failed to reveal abnormalities due to NSM. THE chemical complexity of cigarette smoke precludes the precise attribution of the known carcinogenic effects to a single component or group of components, and animal models are therefore required to assay carcinogenic activity. A model commonly used is the topical application of smoke condensates to mouse skin, and measurement of the incidence of tumours which result. The method has been much used to monitor attempts at reduction of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, and although there is as yet no evidence equating mouse skin response with the human lung response, it is assumed that a direct relationship exists between the ability to induce tumours in mouse skin and in the human bronchial tract. The experiments described were de-signed to determine the carcinogenic potential of smoke condensate from a substitute smoking material and from blends of this material with conventional <b>tobacco.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS Cigarette 8. -These were 2 sizes, each 70 mm long, but either 23 - 0 or 25 - 4 mm in circumference (designated A and B respec-tively).

40|$|Recent studies {{demonstrated}} {{a relationship between}} mass burn rates of straight-grade cigarettes and heats of combustion of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials.</b> In the present work, relationships between measured heats of combustion and elemental composition of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials</b> were further analyzed. Heats of combustion measured in oxygen were directly correlated with the carbon and hydrogen content of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials</b> tested. Ash content of the materials was inversely related to the heats of combustion. The water insoluble residues from exhaustively extracted <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials</b> showed higher heats of combustion and higher carbon content than the non-extracted materials, confirming a direct relationship between carbon content and heat of combustion. A value for the heat of formation of tobacco was estimated (1175 cal/g) from the heat of combustion data and elemental analysis results. The estimated value for heat of formation of tobacco appears to be constant regardless of the material type. Heat values measured in air were uniformly lower than the combustion heats in oxygen, suggesting formation of CO and other reaction products. Gases produced during bomb calorimetry experiments with five <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials</b> were analyzed for CO and CO 2 content. When the materials were burned in oxygen, no CO {{was found in the}} gases produced. Measured heats of combustion matched estimates based on CO 2 found in the gas and conversion of the sample hydrogen content to water. Materials burned in air produced CO 2 (56 % to 77 % of the sample carbon content) and appreciable amounts of CO (7 % to 16 % of the sample carbon content). Unburned residue containing carbon and hydrogen was found in the air combustion experiments. Estimated heat values based on amounts of CO and CO 2 found in the gas and water formed from the hydrogen lost during combustion in air were higher than the measured values. These observations indicate formation of products containing hydrogen when the materials were burned in air. CO and CO 2 formation during combustion in air were related to the composition of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials.</b> Materials with high carbon and low ash content showed evidence of higher CO 2 formation. Amounts of unburned residue also varied with material composition. Thus, energy released during tobacco combustion in air is related to material-dependent formation of reaction products in addition to the carbon oxides and to the quantity of unburned material...|$|R
40|$|Because many {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} tobacco are highly sensitive to its moisture content, {{the determination of}} water level is an important parameter for tobacco characterization. A headspace volumetric Karl Fischer titration (HS-V-KFT) method is presented for the quantification of water content in different finished <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials.</b> The parameters affecting the extraction {{of water from the}} <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials</b> were the sample size and the oven temperature which have been optimized. The extraction of water from the samples was achieved within a reasonable time (< 25 min) with a sample size of 200 mg and an optimum temperature of between 90 °C and 100 °C. The results of the water determination by HS-V-KFT at the optimized parameters were in good agreement with those obtained by standard volumetric Karl Fischer titration. HS-V-KFT showed very good repeatability (RSDr 0. 9 %) and intermediate precision (RSDiR 1. 1 %). With respect to a considerable time saving, solvent consumption reduction, precision and accuracy, HS-V-KFT can therefore be suggested as the method of choice to determine water amount in finished tobacco products...|$|R
30|$|Combustion {{of tobacco}} in a {{cigarette}} is not complete (Baker, 1999). Studies based on calorimetry have determined {{the heat of}} complete combustion of various different tobaccos as 13.8 – 18.4  kJ/g in oxygen (Gugan 1966; Muramatsu et al. 1978; Norman et al. 2001). These values directly correlate with the carbon and hydrogen contents of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials.</b> Although <b>tobaccos</b> are richer in nitrogen content than most other types of biomass, this high nitrogen content does not alter the trend set by carbon and hydrogen contents.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In 2016 {{a series}} of {{selective}} tobacco regulations, which however did not affect tobacco price, came into force in Italy. To understand how Italians accepted the new norms, we analysed data from our two most recent surveys among those we annually conduct on <b>tobacco.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods In 2015 and 2016 we conducted 2 representative cross-sectional studies focused on the new forthcoming tobacco legislation on a total sample of 6046 Italians aged ≥ 15 years. Results Overall, 21. 4 % of Italians (26. 0 % among men and 17. 2 % among women) were current smokers, showing a small but significant decrease in smoking prevalence since 2007 (p for trend= 0. 004). No change in smoking prevalence was observed {{over the last decade}} among the young (i. e., 15 - 24; 20. 1 % in 2015 - 2016). Roll-your-own (RYO) cigarettes were the most frequent tobacco product for 8. 3 % of adult smokers and 19. 7 % of young smokers. According to the attitudes of Italians towards the new regulations, 91. 3 % supported the smoking ban in cars in presence of minors, 90. 2 % a more stringent enforcement of the tobacco sales-to-minors regulation, 74. 3 % the introduction of shocking pictorial images on tobacco packs, and 63. 2 % the removal from the market of small cigarette packs, usually purchased by the young. Conclusions Smoking prevalence only marginally decreased over the last decade among adults, but did not decrease among the young. RYO tobacco is more and more used by adults and young. Before the entrance into force of the new norms, Italians substantially support them, particularly those targeting children. Funding The surveys were conducted with the contribution of the Italian Ministry of Health. This work was partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (The TackSHS Project; grant agreement: 681040) and by the Italian Ministry of Health (MADES project, chapter 4100 / 22).

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} the nicotine content of some popular Indian brands of smoking tobacco (cigarettes and bidis) and pan masalas (chewable <b>tobacco).</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Commercially available cigarettes, bidis, and pan masalas (chewable tobacco) {{were obtained from}} local retail outlets for the study. Nicotine was estimated using gas-liquid chromatography. Results: The analyses showed relatively higher levels of nicotine in tobacco from bidis (26. 9 mg gm) as compared to cigarettes(15 mg/gm); the difference is stastically significant (P 0. 01). Nicotine concentration in chewing tobacco was 3. 4 mg/gm. Conclusion: The study concludes that the nicotine content of Indian brands of smoking tobacco was slightly high compared to other international brands. Higher concentration of nicotine was found in bidis compared to cigarettes. The nicotine content in commercially available chewing tobacco products {{was found to be}} much lower than in the smoking form of tobacco, but the average daily consumption made it comparable to the smoking form...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Is use {{of tobacco}} a major health problem among medical students? To {{find out the}} factors {{associated}} with the use of <b>tobacco.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: A cross-sectional study was done on 250 undergraduate male medical students using a pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire to study about the problem and various correlates of the tobacco use. Data was collected and analysed using Excel and SPSS software. Results: Among the tobacco users (28. 8 &#x 0025;), smoking was found in 87. 5 &#x 0025; and tobacco chewing in the form of gutka, khaini, gulmanjan (locally available forms of tobacco) in 37. 5 &#x 0025; as the predominant means of the use of tobacco. The mean age of our sample was 23. 5 years. The residential background, i. e., rural or urban, and religion were not significantly {{associated with the use}} of tobacco in the present study. Hostellers were found to be more frequent tobacco users as compared to day-scholars. There was a familial aggregation of the use of tobacco. The factor initiating the use of tobacco was usually peer pressure. Conclusion: Tobacco use is a significant problem among the male medical students and we need to take steps to stop its use by them so as to prevent them from being exposed to its hazardous effects. This will also make their role in the advocacy of the smoking cessation activities more trustworthy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} effect of the tobacco industry's {{marketing}} practices on adolescents by examining the relationship between their receptivity to these practices and their susceptibility to start smoking.  DESIGN—Paper-and-pencil surveys measuring association with other smokers, exposure to tobacco industry marketing strategies, experience with smoking, and resolve not to smoke in the future.  SETTING— 25 randomly selected classrooms in five middle schools in San Jose, California.  SUBJECTS— 571 seventh graders with an average age of 13  years and 8  months; 57 % were female. Forty-five per cent of the students were Asian, 38 % were Hispanic, 12 % were white, and 5 % were black.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Exposure to social influences, receptivity to marketing strategies, susceptibility to start smoking.  RESULTS—About 70 % of the participants indicated at least moderate receptivity to <b>tobacco</b> marketing <b>materials.</b> Children who are more receptive are also more susceptible to start smoking. In addition to demographics and social influences, receptivity to <b>tobacco</b> marketing <b>materials</b> was found to be strongly associated with susceptibility.  CONCLUSIONS—Tobacco companies conduct marketing campaigns that effectively capture teenage attention and stimulate desire for their promotional items. These marketing strategies may function to move young teenagers from non-smoking status toward regular use of tobacco. Our results demonstrate that there is a clear association between tobacco marketing practices and youngsters' susceptibility to smoke. The findings, along with other research, provide compelling support for regulating the manner in which tobacco products are marketed, to protect young people from the tobacco industry's strategies to reach them.    Keywords: adolescents; advertising; smoking initiatio...|$|R
40|$|Transfer of {{nicotine}} to mainstream smoke was measured for Reference cigarettes {{made with the}} addition of 20 - 40 mg of seven different nicotine salts, d- and l-nicotine and N’-formylnornicotine. Regression analysis of the nicotine yields from these cigarettes {{as a function of the}} nicotine content of the tobacco rods indicated an average nicotine transfer efficiency (17. 5 %), similar to that found for a separate series of cigarettes made with single-grade <b>tobacco</b> <b>materials</b> (16. 2 %). Analysis of the enantiomeric purity of the smoke nicotine from the cigarettes made with added nicotine salts and neat nicotine showed no evidence of conversion between l- and d-nicotine during the smoking process. The cigarette made with added N’-formylnornicotine showed no evidence of additional nicotine transfer attributable to reduction of this compound to nicotine. A third series of cigarettes were made with varying levels of d- and l-nicotine added to a tobacco blend and to reconstituted tobacco to further investigate transfer efficiency of the enantiomers. Regression analysis indicated no statistically significant difference between transfer efficiencies of d- and l-nicotine. These results suggest that nicotine salts and d- and l-nicotine transfer to smoke at the same efficiency. However, transfer efficiency of either compound was lower when applied to reconstituted tobacco (9. 7 %) than when applied to the Reference tobacco blend (15. 3 %). The thermal stabilities {{of nicotine}} salts have little bearing on efficiency of transfer to smoke or on racemization between d- and l-nicotine.
