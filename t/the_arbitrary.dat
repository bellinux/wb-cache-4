5|$|In {{the period}} from 1975 to 2001, the Emir ruled by decree. Human rights activists and {{opposition}} leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> arrest of thousands, and assassinations, {{all of which were}} denied by the authorities. Bahrain's Shia population widely claimed that they were being discriminated against by the government, and that they were being treated as second class citizens.|$|E
5|$|The Perl {{languages}} borrow features {{from other}} programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread {{popularity in the}} late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, {{in part due to}} its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, {{a second}} {{operation}} {{was conducted by}} the same units, {{this time in the}} northern Armenian town of Voskepar. Under the same pretext as the previous operation, the joint forces entered Armenia with tanks and other armored vehicles, claiming that militia units were staging attacks from that area into Azerbaijan. The operation was conducted in a similar manner but with deadlier results. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> arrests of twenty men in towns surrounding Voskepar, a bus carrying thirty Armenian policemen was attacked by elements of the 23rd Division, killing eleven of the officers and arresting the rest. The OMON units also took part in razing and looting the outlying villages around Voskepar. Residents were similarly forced to leave their homes and thus ceded them after signing a form which stated that they were leaving their homes at their own volition.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite the shared language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|Though Dhumavati {{may seem}} to be a goddess to be avoided due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati is described as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward off all the negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's {{primary concern}} was {{to place the}} {{provision}} of food supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E
5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} {{argument}} on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by <b>the</b> <b>arbitrary</b> nature of the exact size of the universe or the time of its creation.|$|E
