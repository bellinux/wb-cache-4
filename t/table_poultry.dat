50|$|Bresse {{extends from}} the Dombes on the south to the Doubs River on the north, and from the Saône eastwards to the Jura mountains, {{measuring}} some 60 miles in the former, and 20 miles in the latter direction. It is a plain varying from 600 to 800 feet above the sea, with few eminences and a slight inclination westwards. Heaths and coppice alternate with pastures and arable land; pools and marshes are numerous, especially in the north. Its chief rivers are the Veyle, the Reyssouze and the Seille, all tributaries of the Saône. The soil is a gravelly clay but moderately fertile, and cattle-raising is largely carried on. The region is, however, more especially celebrated for its <b>table</b> <b>poultry.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the requirement of digestible tryptophan for white laying hens in the production stage fed diets of different digestible tryptophan: digestible lysine ratios, as well as animal performance and histological alterations in their reproductive and digestive systems. A total of 280 white laying hens at 29 weeks of age were distributed in a completely randomized design with five treatments and seven replications with eight birds in each. The treatments consisted of a base feed, formulated with corn, soybean meal and corn gluten meal, and supplemented with the synthetic amino acids L-lysine, DL-methionine, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-arginine, and L-valine, so as to meet the nutritional requirements for laying hens, except for digestible tryptophan. The basal diet was supplemented with 0. 00; 0. 017; 0. 035; 0. 052; and 0. 069 g/kg of L-tryptophan in substitution for corn starch with the {{objective of}} reaching the levels of 0. 151; 0. 167; 0. 183; 0. 199; and 0. 215 g/kg of digestible tryptophan in the feed. For the ratio between digestible amino acids and lysine, the recommendation of Brazilian <b>Tables</b> for <b>Poultry</b> and Swine was followed, except for the digestible tryptophan: digestible lysine ratios, which were 19, 21, 23, 25 and 27 for each treatment. The variation in the digestible tryptophan: digestible lysine ratio promoted changes in performance and in the histological characteristics, improving the results. The digestible tryptophan: digestible lysine ratio of 24. 5 % in the feed of white laying hens in production stage promotes better animal performance and histological results.

40|$|O experimento foi conduzido para determinar os valores energéticos de 12 alimentos para codornas japonesas. Utilizaram-se 280 codornas com 19 semanas de idade, submetidas ao método de coleta total de excretas, em delineamento em blocos casualizados, com dez codornas por unidade {{experimental}}. O período experimental teve 32 dias de duração, dividido em quatro ensaios de oito dias, nos quais foram estudados dois grupos de alimentos (protéicos e energéticos), com cinco repetições cada um. Os grupos constaram de alimentos protéicos de origem animal (farinha de carne e ossos, farinha de peixe e farinha de penas e vísceras) e vegetal (farelos de soja 1 e 2) e alimentos energéticos de origem vegetal (milheto, sorgo e farelo de arroz integral) e óleo e gorduras (óleo de soja refinado, gordura de aves, sebo bovino e gordura de suínos). Os alimentos substituíram a ração-referência, à base de milho e farelo de soja, em 20 % (protéicos de origem animal), 30 % (protéicos de origem vegetal), 40 % (energéticos de origem vegetal) e 10 % (óleo e gorduras) na matéria natural (MN). Foram avaliados os valores de energia metabolizável aparente (EMA) e verdadeira (EMV) corrigidos pelo balanço de nitrogênio (EMAn e EMVn), e os coeficientes de metabolização da energia bruta (CMEB). As fontes protéicas estudadas, à exceção da farinha de penas e vísceras, apresentaram valores de EMAn superiores aos encontrados nas tabelas brasileiras para aves e suínos; a farinha de carne e ossos apresentou o maior CMEB (74, 06 %) e a de penas e vísceras, o menor (56, 24 %). Os alimentos energéticos avaliados, à exceção do sorgo, apresentaram valores de EMAn superiores aos referenciados nas tabelas brasileiras; o óleo de soja refinado e a gordura de suínos tiveram os maiores CMEB (95, 81 e 93, 32 %, respectivamente), enquanto o farelo de arroz integral apresentou o mais baixo CMEB (61, 13 %). The {{experiment was}} conducted to determine the energy values of 12 feeds for Japanese quails. Two hundred and eighty quails averaging 19 weeks old were submitted to the method of total feces collection as a randomized block design, with ten quails per experimental unit. The experimental period lasted 32 days, divided into four trials of eight days each, where two groups of feeds were studied (protein and energetic), with five replicates each: protein of animal origin (meat and bone meal, fish meal and feather and viscera meal) and plant (soybean meals 1 and 2), as well as energetic feeds of plant origin (millet, sorghum and whole rice bran) and oil and fats (refined soybean oil, poultry fat, beef tallow and swine fat). The feeds replaced the reference diet (corn, soybean meal-based diet), as-fed, in 20 % (protein of animal origin), 30 % (protein of plant origin), 40 % (energetic of plant origin) and 10 % (oil and fats). The values of apparent metabolizable energy (AME), true (TME), AME and TME corrected by nitrogen balance (AMEn and TMEn), {{as well as the}} metabolization coefficients of gross energy (MGEC) were the analyzed variables. The protein sources, with the exception of feather and viscera meal, had values of AMEn higher than those of the Brazilian <b>tables</b> for <b>poultry</b> and swine, meat and bone meal showed the greatest MGEC (74. 06 %), while feather and viscera meal, the lowest (56. 24 %). The energetic feeds, with exception of sorghum, showed higher values of AMEn than those cited by the Brazilian <b>tables</b> for <b>poultry</b> and swine, and both refined soybean oil and swine fat had the highest MGEC (95. 81 % and 93. 32 %, respectively), while whole rice bran, the lowest (61. 13 %) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} {{the role played by}} cattle (Bos taurus – Linnaeus, 1758) in the Romanised {{southeast}} of the Alps has included 8, 579 remains of the species. Dating from the mid- 1 st century BC to the 6 th century AD, they originate from 22 samples with at least 100 taxonomically identified bones or teeth (Table 1; Figure 1). In addition to these, seven additional minor samples are occasionally considered as well (Table 2), but their use was limited to the role of independent reference points in the testing of hypotheses, which were based on results yielded by the analysis of the 22 ‘major’ samples. The differences between sites in the methodology of archaeological excavations and of gathering the finds, in the approach to their taxonomic identification, in the extent of taphonomical differences and in the degree of fragmentation (Figure 2) were generally small. A survey of the share of various mammals reveals an evident predominance of the bones and teeth of cattle, sheep/goats and pigs, with a marginal role delegated to wild game. From about the mid- 1 st century BC to the 4 th century AD, the most numerous is in fact the cattle (Figure 3). It was only with the beginning of late antiquity that major changes took place: the political instability and insecurity, as well as the accompanying settlement changes, heavily reduced the extent of cattle-breeding, while preference was given to the far less demanding sheep/goat and/or pig. These circumstances also correspond with the simultaneous increase in poultry. An analysis of the hierarchy of cattle-breeding aims reveals that while cattle certainly represented the central source of red meat for the population, cattle-breeders were primarily interested in exploiting the strength of the animals and possibly in acquiring milk (the latter especially {{in the context of the}} economically ever more self-sufficient settlements of late antiquity). The preferred slaughter age was four years and more (Figure   5; Table 3), and still increased with time Figure 6). An analysis of sex structure yields a comparable ratio between cows and bulls/oxen. The decline of cattle-breeding in late antiquity was accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in the animals’ average size, which may be attributed to the disappearance of the larger, progressive, ‘Roman’ breeds and the return to the less demanding, smaller, traditional local forms. The latter had been present in the area as early as the Iron Age but largely ousted in the Roman period by imported, deliberately developed new breeds. This demanding cattle-breeding branch, however, was presumably impossible to maintain at the earlier level in the changed circumstances of late antiquity, which were finally to cause major changes in the settlement pattern. Another factor would have been the partial loss of zootechnic skills. The conclusion provides an insight into the role played by cattle in the ancient spiritual concepts of this part of Europe. The results point to obvious differences between the assortment of animal bones and teeth found in indi- vidual graves and the ordinary kitchen waste of the locals, as the latter includes a higher ratio of cattle and a lower ratio of <b>poultry</b> (<b>Table</b> 4). True, the results obtained may partly (or even primarily) reflect the different approaches to carving up larger and smaller animals: an offering of beef would have con- sisted of meat already separated from the bones. But a perfectly real alternative possibility, supported at least by the abovementioned discrepancy in the poultry bone ratio, is that the grave offerings tended to contain superior dis- hes, significantly different from the community’s daily grub...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues related}} to surveillance for disease in commercial and non-commercial poultry populations. The motivation for this work has largely arisen from the unprecedented outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 {{that have occurred in}} 52 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe since 2003. A series of studies are presented using data derived from two countries, Vietnam and New Zealand. The two Vietnamese studies provide in-depth epidemiological analyses of the outbreak of HPAI H 5 N 1 from December 2003 to March 2004. The three New Zealand studies deal with {{issues related to}} the development of effective surveillance strategies for HPAI — informed both directly and indirectly by the findings from the Vietnamese studies. This approach provides an example of how ‘lessons’ learnt from countries that have experienced large scale infectious disease epidemics can be used to assist in the design of surveillance activities in (as yet) unaffected countries. The descriptive analyses of the 2003 – 2004 outbreak of HPAI H 5 N 1 in Vietnam indicate that the epidemic was seeded simultaneously in the north and south of the country in the later part of 2003 with 87 % of provinces affected by February 2004. HPAI risk was concentrated around the Mekong and Red River Deltas. The broad scale spatial distribution of disease is likely to have been associated with regional differences in the poultry farming, trade in poultry, and environmental conditions such as the presence of bodies of water which would support reservoir species for the virus. A Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson regression model was used to quantify the influence of environmental and demographic factors on the spatial distribution of HPAI positive communes. In areas where disease was reported, our results show that HPAI risk was positively associated with the presence of irrigation and negatively associated with elevation. After controlling for these fixed effects, a single large area of elevated risk in the Red River Delta area was identified, presumably arising from similarities in the likelihood of reporting disease or the presence of factors increasing disease transmission and spread. Further investigations to elucidate likely transmission mechanisms, targeting this area of the country, would be a profitable area of future research. The second part of this thesis presents three studies that address issues related to the development of effective surveillance strategies for HPAI in New Zealand. The first was a cross-sectional study to enumerate the prevalence of backyard poultry ownership in two areas (one urban and the other rural) close to a large provincial city in the North Island of New Zealand. The prevalence of poultry ownership was 2 % (95 % CI 1 % – 4 %) in the urban area and 19 % (95 % CI 12 % – 30 %) in the rural area. The relatively low numbers of land parcels where poultry are present indicates that these areas, {{in the event of an}} infectious disease incursion, would be unlikely to pose a risk for spread of infectious agent. A cross-sectional survey of all members of the Poultry Industry Association of New Zealand was conducted in the later half of 2007. Respondents were asked to document contacts made with other enterprises related to feed, live birds and hatching eggs, <b>table</b> eggs and <b>poultry</b> product, and waste litter and manure. Patterns of contact were analysed using social network analyses. Each of the four networks had scale-free properties, meaning that for each movement type there were small numbers of enterprises that had contacts with large numbers of enterprises (potential ‘super-spreaders’ of disease). The presence of an undetected infectious disease in enterprises with super-spreader characteristics increases the likelihood that an epidemic will propagate rapidly through the population, assuming there is a directly proportional relationship between the number of contacts an enterprise makes and the probability that disease will be transferred from one location to another. While the finding that feed suppliers had large numbers of poultry farm contacts in the feed network came as no surprise, what was of greater interest was that there were small numbers of poultry farms that reported off-farm movements of feed. This should serve as an important reminder for disease control authorities: movement (and other) restrictions applied during the course of an animal health emergency should be applied across a range of industry sectors, recognising that some industry participants may practice activities that are not entirely typical for their enterprise type (e. g. poultry farms on-selling feed to other farms). In the absence of perfect and up-to-date network data, knowledge of the characteristics of individual enterprises that render them more likely to be atypical (e. g. size, type, and geographic location) would be of value, since this information could be used to inform a risk based approach to disease surveillance and control. A scenario tree model was developed as an approach for evaluating the effectiveness of New Zealand’s passive surveillance system for HPAI. The model was developed in two stages. In the first, factors thought to influence the geographic distribution of NAI risk of introduction and spread (and therefore surveillance strategy) were combined to create a spatial risk surface. In the second stage, a scenario tree model of the passive surveillance system for NAI was developed using the spatial risk surface and the HPAI surveillance strategy prescribed by Biosecurity New Zealand. The model was most sensitive to farmers reporting the presence of suspected cases of disease. This implies that the sensitivity of the system as a whole stands to increase if the importance of reporting suspicious clinical signs is reiterated to poultry producers. The studies presented in this thesis have presented a range of techniques and methodological approaches that are sufficiently generic to be used in any country to inform the design of surveillance strategies for a variety of animal diseases, not just those of poultry. Although epidemiology, as a discipline, is endoured with a vast range of analytical techniques that can be used to enhance the understanding of factors influencing the spread of disease among animal populations, the quality of data used to support these techniques is often lacking. The challenge in the years ahead, for both developed and developing countries, is to set in place the appropriate infrastructures to collect details of animal populations consistent in quality over time and space...|$|R
