5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. <b>These</b> <b>materials</b> can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the ‘massification’ of strategy. The primary sense of massification reflects {{the recovery of}} Latour's ‘missing masses’ in strategy research, in other words the growing recognition of material artefacts. But there are two contingent senses of massification as well. First, many of <b>these</b> <b>material</b> artefacts are mass-produced (e. g. laptops) and therefore commonly used across many sites of strategy work. Second, some of <b>these</b> <b>material</b> artefacts (e. g. social media) are increasingly tools for mass participation, facilitating the involvement of many employees in strategy work. This paper considers the implications of both mass production and mass participation for strategy-as-practice research, {{particularly with regard to}} comparative method and critical scrutiny...|$|R
5|$|In {{some unusual}} ionic compounds: fast ion conductors, and ionic glasses, {{one or more}} of the ionic {{components}} has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid. This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration. <b>These</b> <b>materials</b> are used in all solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E
5|$|Io plays a {{significant}} role in shaping Jupiter's magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes, releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than twice the size it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of ionized and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. <b>These</b> <b>materials</b> originate from Io's volcanic activity, but the material that escapes to Jupiter's magnetic field and into interplanetary space comes directly from Io's atmosphere. <b>These</b> <b>materials,</b> depending on their ionized state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result {{of the cost of the}} raw {{material}} as of the production costs.

5|$|Trade over vast {{areas of}} the Mediterranean was {{essential}} for the economy of Mycenaean Greece. The Mycenaean palaces imported raw materials, such as metals, ivory and glass, and exported processed commodities and objects made from <b>these</b> <b>materials,</b> in addition to local products: oil, perfume, wine, wool and pottery.

5|$|Although ionic {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, <b>these</b> <b>materials</b> do {{not typically}} conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the ionic mobility and solid state ionic conductivity is observed. When the ionic compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of ionic compounds.|$|E

Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E

In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Sintering powders of {{samarium}} oxide and boron, in vacuum, {{yields a}} powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All <b>these</b> <b>materials</b> are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E
