40|$|OBJECTIVE: Computer-tailored and Internet-based {{interventions}} to promote physical activity behavior have shown some promise, but only few {{have been tested}} among African Americans. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of three 1 -year, multiple contact physical activity interventions (<b>Tailored</b> <b>Internet,</b> Tailored Print, Standard Internet) in a subsample of African American participants (n = 38) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants randomly assigned to <b>Tailored</b> <b>Internet</b> and Print programs received individually tailored computer expert system feedback delivered via Internet or print. Participants in the Standard Internet program received access to six currently available physical activity Web sites. Self-reported physical activity was assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months with the 7 -Day Physical Activity Recall. RESULTS: Across all participants, physical activity changed from 17. 24 min/week (standard deviation [SD] = 20. 72) at baseline to 139. 44 min/week (SD = 99. 20) at 6 months, to 104. 26 min/week (SD = 129. 14) at 12 months. According to available consumer satisfaction data (n = 30), 70 % reported reading {{most or all of}} the physical activity information received by Internet or mail. Most participants described the Internet- and print-based physical activity programs as "somewhat" or "very" helpful (80 %) and enjoyable (87 %). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that computer-tailored and Internet-based interventions are able to produce long-term increases in physical activity and associated process variables among African American participants. Future studies with larger numbers of African American participants are needed to determine which of the programs (Tailored Print, <b>Tailored</b> <b>Internet,</b> Standard Internet) are more effective and what program modifications might be helpful in assisting this population in becoming more active...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus infection (HBV) is {{an important}} health problem in the Turkish community in the Netherlands, and promotion of screening for HBV in this risk group is necessary. An individually tailored intervention and a culturally tailored intervention {{have been developed to}} promote screening in first generation 16 - 40 year old Turkish immigrants. This paper describes the design of the randomized controlled trial, which will be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the two <b>tailored</b> <b>internet</b> interventions as compared to generic online information on HBV, and to assess the added value of tailoring on socio-cultural factors. Methods/Design A cluster randomized controlled trial design, in which we invite all Rotterdam registered inhabitants born in Turkey, aged 16 - 40 (n = 10, 000), to visit the intervention website is used. A cluster includes all persons living at one house address. The clusters are randomly assigned to either group A, B or C. On the website, persons eligible for testing will be selected through a series of exclusion questions and will then continue in the randomly assigned intervention group. Group A will receive generic information on HBV. Group B will receive individually tailored information related to social-cognitive determinants of screening. Group C will receive culturally tailored information which, next to social-cognitive factors, addresses cultural factors related to screening. Subsequently, participants may obtain a laboratory form, with which they can be tested free of charge at local health centres. The main outcome of the study is the percentage of eligible persons tested for HBV through to participation in one of the three groups. Measurements of the outcome behaviour and its determinants will be at baseline and five weeks post-intervention. Discussion This trial will provide information on the effectiveness of a culturally <b>tailored</b> <b>internet</b> intervention promoting HBV-screening in first generation Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands, aged 16 - 40. The results will contribute to the evidence base for culturally <b>tailored</b> (<b>internet)</b> interventions in ethnic minority populations. An effective intervention will lead to a reduction of the morbidity and mortality due to HBV in this population. This may not only benefit patients, but also help reduce health inequalities in western countries. Trial Registration The Netherlands National Trial Register NTR 2394. </p...|$|E

Screening for hepatitis B should be promoted through public health interventions, which {{take into account the}} socio-cultural and behavioural determinants that influence screening. The Intervention Mapping protocol was used to develop a culturally <b>tailored</b> <b>Internet</b> intervention for first-generation Turkish immigrants in Rotterdam, aged 1640 year. Behavioural factors and cultural motivators and barriers, identified in the first steps of the protocol, were incorporated in the intervention. To ensure participation, members of the target population were involved in all steps of programme development. A theory-and evidence-based culturally tailored intervention was developed. Both surface structure and deep structure elements were used; surface structure tailoring resulting in different Internet skins and peer-stories for subgroups, such as young women. Deep structure elements comprised cultural motivators such as the religiously inspired feelings of responsibility and strong family values, and perceived community rules regarding health and disease. Cultural barriers that were addressed were the satisfaction and trust in Dutch health care, and the association of hepatitis B screening with sexual behaviour. Intervention Mapping provided a useful framework for the systematic development of our theory-and evidence-based intervention to promote hepatitis B screening in the Turkish community in the Netherlands. © 2011 The Author...|$|E

This trial is studying the effect of a longitudinally <b>tailored</b> <b>Internet</b> and mobile phone based intervention that is based on models of health behaviour, on the level of physical activity and the adherence to the intervention, as an extension of a face-to-face cardiac rehabilitation stay. A parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial.

40|$|Background: Since {{medication}} nonadherence {{is considered}} to be an important health risk, numerous interventions to improve adherence have been developed. During the past decade, the use of Internet-based interventions to improve medication adherence has increased rapidly. Internet interventions have the potential advantage of tailoring the interventions to the needs and situation of the patient. Objective: The main aim of this systematic review was to investigate which <b>tailored</b> <b>Internet</b> interventions are effective in improving medication adherence. Methods: We undertook comprehensive literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Communication Abstracts, following the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. The methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials and methods for measuring adherence were independently reviewed by two researchers. Results: A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. All included Internet interventions clearly used moderately or highly sophisticated computer-tailored methods. Data synthesis revealed that there is evidence for the effectiveness of Internet interventions in improving medication adherence: 5 studies (3 high-quality studies and 2 low-quality studies) showed a significant effect on adherence; 6 other studies (4 high-quality studies and 2 low-quality studies) reported a moderate effect on adherence; and 2 studies (1 high-quality study and 1 low-quality study) showed no effect on patients’ adherence. However, most studies used self-reported measurements to assess adherence, which is generally perceived as a low-quality measurement. In addition, we did not find a clear relationship between the quality of the studies or the level of sophistication of message tailoring and the effectiveness of the intervention. This might be explained by the great difference in study designs and the way of measuring adherence, which makes results difficult to compare. There was also large variation in the measured interval between baseline and follow-up measurements. Conclusion: This review shows promising results on the effectiveness of Internet interventions to enhance patients’ adherence to prescribed long-term medications. Although there is evidence according to the data synthesis, the results must be interpreted with caution due to low-quality adherence measurements. Future studies using high-quality measurements to assess medication adherence are recommended to establish more robust evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions on medication adherence...|$|E
40|$|Background Cancer {{places a}} {{considerable}} burden on patients’ health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL). Information on own disease can both help patients to cope with symptoms and side-effects, and make them more competent participants in shared decision-making with clinicians. In this context the Center for Shared Decision Making and Nursing Research developed a <b>tailored</b> <b>Internet</b> support system called WebChoice. This thesis is a partial economic evaluation {{of the effects of}} WebChoice, where its impact on HRQOL is explored. Methods The research team randomised breast cancer and prostate cancer patients into two groups, a WebChoice group and a control group. The patients’ HRQOL was measured three times during the intervention period of one year. HRQOL weights were measured with the multi attribute health status classification system, 15 D. This thesis measures the health outcome and WebChoice effects by statistical methods. The health outcome was measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Data were analysed with t-tests and multiple linear regressions. Results In total, 445 patients were recruited and randomised to WebChoice groups or control groups. This thesis presents data for 234 patients who filled in the 15 D questionnaire at baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months. Among 130 breast cancer patients included in this study, the mean 15 D score at baseline was 0. 85 in the WebChoice group and 0. 88 in the control group, while the respective means were 0. 85 and 0. 88 {{by the end of the}} trial. Among 104 prostate cancer patients included in this study, the mean 15 D score at baseline was 0. 87 in the WebChoice group and 0. 87 in the control group, while the respective means were 0. 84 and 0. 84 by the end of the trial. Adjusted for baseline 15 D, the mean QALYs gained for WebChoice compared to the control group, was - 0. 03 for the breast cancer group and - 0. 01 for the prostate cancer group. HRQOL score at baseline was the only variable which had a significant impact on this result. Interpretation/conclusion The results of this study indicate that WebChoice has no impact on HRQOL for breast cancer and prostate cancer patients. However, the conclusion must be made with the following reservations: The result does not necessarily apply to patients with a recent diagnosis, or with little education or with a low HRQOL...|$|E

40|$|Security {{and privacy}} {{concerns}} are becoming an important barrier for large scale adoption and {{deployment of the}} Internet of Things. To address this issue, the identity management system defined herein provides a novel holistic and privacy-preserving solution aiming to cope with heterogeneous scenarios that requires both traditional online access control and authentication, along with claim-based approach for M 2 M (machine to machine) interactions required in IoT. It combines a cryptographic approach for claim-based authentication using the Idemix anonymous credential system, together with classic IdM mechanisms by relying on the FIWARE IdM (Keyrock). This symbiosis endows the IdM system with advanced features such as privacy-preserving, minimal disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, unlikability, confidentiality, pseudonymity, strong authentication, user consent, and offline M 2 M transactions. The IdM system has been specially <b>tailored</b> for the <b>Internet</b> of Things bearing in mind the management of both users’ and smart objects’ identity. Moreover, the IdM system has been successfully implemented, deployed, and tested in the scope of SocIoTal European research project...|$|R
40|$|This study {{researched}} the preparedness of English as a Second Language directors in school corporations in Indiana {{to determine their}} background experiences, awareness of second language acquisition research, levels of qualification, attitudes towards English learners (ELs), efficacy for leading ESL programs, and to {{gain an understanding of}} how to provide guidance and support to this group of individuals. Furthermore, the study investigated relationships between these factors to gain insight into how they impact each other and program implementation. The study endeavored to provide useful information towards policy making and support of ESL leaders. The research was quantitative and utilized a <b>tailored</b> design <b>Internet</b> survey to collect data. Descriptive data was analyzed using analysis of frequency (distribution, central tendency and dispersion of individual variables), while relationships between elements were analyzed using a combination of ANOVA, and Pearson’s Product Moment correlational analysis, followed by post hoc analysis and regression analysis. Findings indicated that having experience with English learners and teaching certification for working with English learners were significant factors in the areas of knowledge, attitude, and efficacy. An exploratory model of ESL program leadership, developed by the researcher, concluded that when EL directors are certified and bring experience of working with ELs to their positions, {{it is more likely that}} their programs will be successfully implemented. Finally, the interplay of variables showed that these directors’ levels of knowledge of second language acquisition principles and efficacy for leading the ESL program had highly significant effects on attitude, program implementation and each other. The implications of this study include directions for policy, training programs, and further research. Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{clear trend}} of the Web is {{that a variety of}} new {{consumer}} devices with diverse computing powers, display capabilities, and wired/wireless network connections is gaining access to the <b>Internet.</b> <b>Tailoring</b> Web content to match the device characteristics requires functionalities for content transformation, namely transcoding, that are typically carried out by the content Web server or by an edge proxy server. In this paper, we explore how to improve the user response time by considering systems of cooperative edge servers which collaborate in discovering, transcoding, and delivering multiple versions of Web objects. The transcoding functionality opens an entirely new space of investigation in the research area of distributed cache cooperation, because it transforms the proxy servers from content repositories along the client-server path into pro-active network elements providing computation and adaptive delivery. We propose and investigate different algorithms for cooperative discovery, delivery, and transcoding in the context of edge servers organized in hierarchical and flat peer-to-peer topologies. We compare the performance of the proposed schemes through ColTrES (Collaborative Transcoder Edge Services), a flexible prototype testbed that implements all considered mechanisms. ...|$|R
40|$|Background With {{the advent}} of rich {{internet}} applications (RIA’s), part of processing has been transferred from the server to the client. However, many geo-spatial applications still require serverside access to a geodatabase to select and manipulate data using SQL. It would be profitable if these actions could be handled by an {{out of the box}} serverside component, thus eliminating the need {{for the development of a}} custom serverside component. Can OGC standards like WMS and WFS play a role here? Since WFS-T provides select, insert, delete and update methods much like SQL, it was decided to investigate whether the WFS-T implementation specification could replace SQL when developing complex geo-spatial applications. Or is SQL still needed? Method To answer this research question, this approach was tested during the development of several <b>tailor</b> made <b>internet</b> GIS applications: - a wheater and crop growth monitoring system; - a discussion support system for the water domain; - a national cultural heritage portal. Results Filtering and manipulating serverside data by WFS-T using the OpenGIS Filter Encoding Standard (FES) fullfills the needs to a large extent. Almost all of the desired functionality is there. There is one major limitation: FES lacks the ability to define a filter expression based on a joined table. Dependant on the implementation a work around may be available. Xml-schemas support 1 -to-many relationships. They can be implemented as a joined table, which as a result can be queried. For larger datasets - a couple of ten thousand records or more - WFS-T tends to end up with a bad performance. Larger datasets should be processed serverside. Downloading large amounts of data and processing them clientside is too time-consuming. Compared to SQL WFS-T has less possibilities to influence the serverside performance. So for performance reasons SQL stays inevitable to handle larger datasets...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of services provided through the Web is continuously increasing {{as well as}} the variety of new devices that are gaining access to the <b>Internet.</b> <b>Tailoring</b> Web and multimedia resources to meet the user and client requirements opens two main novel issues in the research area of content delivery. The working set tends to increase substantially because multiple versions may be generated from the same original resource. Moreover, the content adaptation operations may be computationally expensive. In this paper, we consider third-party infrastructures composed by a geographically distributed system of intermediary and cooperative nodes that provide fast content adaptation and delivery of Web resources. We propose a novel distributed architecture of intermediary nodes which are organized in two levels. The front-end nodes in the first tier are thin edge servers that locate the resources and forward the client requests to the nodes in the second tier. These interior nodes are fat servers that run the most expensive functions such as content adaptation, resource caching and fetching. Through real prototypes we compare the performance of the proposed two-level architecture to that of alternative one-level infrastructures where all nodes are fat peers providing the entire set of functions. 1...|$|R
40|$|The goal of Denali is {{to safely}} execute many independent, untrusted server {{applications}} {{on a single}} physical machine. This would enable any developer to inject a new service into third-party Internet infrastructure; for example, dynamic content generation code could be introduced into content delivery networks or caching systems. We believe that virtual machine monitors (VMMs) are ideally suited to this application domain. A VMM provide strong isolation by default, since one machine cannot directly name a resource in another machine. In addition, VMMs defer the implementation of high-level abstractions to guest OSs, which greatly simplifies the kernel and nullifies “layer-below ” attacks. The main challenge in using a VMM for this application domain is in scaling the number of concurrent VMs that can simultaneously execute on it. The distinction between Denali and existing VMMs is that we make aggressive use of para-virtualization techniques. Para-virtualization entails selectively modifying the virtual architecture to enhance scalability, performance, and simplicity. By using para-virtualization, we believe Denali {{will be able to}} scale to an order-ofmagnitude more virtual machines than existing VMMs. We have implemented a virtual machine monitor that runs in kernel mode on bare x 86 hardware. In addition, we have built a simple guest OS <b>tailored</b> to writing <b>Internet</b> services...|$|R
