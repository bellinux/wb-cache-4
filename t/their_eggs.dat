5|$|Thrips lay {{extremely}} small eggs, about 0.2mm long. Females of the suborder Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their ovipositor, and insert <b>their</b> <b>eggs,</b> one per slit. Females of the suborder Tubulifera lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> singly {{or in small}} groups on the outside surfaces of plants.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing <b>their</b> <b>eggs,</b> or in spring prior to spawning, resorb <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in {{the soil}} or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
50|$|Female Pisaurids create <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> case in {{one piece}} and carry it under their body with their chelicerae. This differs from similar looking female Lycosids which {{construct}} <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> case in two pieces and fasten it behind them with their spinnerets.|$|R
50|$|Reproduction {{seems to}} occur in August. Females guard <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> clutch.|$|R
50|$|Candy nudibranchs are hermaphrodites. <b>Their</b> <b>egg</b> mass is {{a spiral}} collar of orange eggs.|$|R
5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on it, leaving it in place, or carry {{it back to}} their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> {{is based on}} the size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> during the warm summer season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{their common}} name, purple ladies are hermaphrodites. <b>Their</b> <b>egg</b> mass is highly {{convoluted}} and white.|$|R
50|$|Wolf spiders {{resemble}} nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), but wolf spiders carry <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> sacs {{by attaching}} {{them to their}} spinnerets (Pisauridae carry <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> sacs with <b>their</b> chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from grass spiders.|$|R
50|$|This fish is oviparous, {{producing}} two eggs at a time. The developing embryos feed on <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> yolks.|$|R
5|$|Adult males vigorously defend territories near water; {{these areas}} provide {{suitable}} habitat for the larvae to develop, and for females to lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to prey on swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites.|$|E
5|$|Birds of {{variable}} size with slender bodies and long tails. Some species are lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of other birds. There are about 141 species worldwide, {{one of which}} breeds in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. <b>Their</b> <b>eggs</b> are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
50|$|Adult {{females of}} the tribe have an {{enlarged}} seventh abdominal segment with a tuft of scales and use this adaptation to protect <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> mass.|$|R
5000|$|Peucetia viridans also {{is unusual}} among spiders in that females {{defending}} <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> purses will spray or [...] "spit" [...] venom at intruders, including humans.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{fertilisation}} stage, a sudden decrease of Juno from the egg cell surface occurs and Juno becomes virtually undetectable after just 40 minutes. Still, after fertilization via intracytoplasmic sperm injection, the egg cell does not lose cell-surface expression of Juno, {{which suggests that}} Juno contributes to the prevention of polyspermy. Mice lacking Juno {{on the surface of}} <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> cells are infertile because <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> cells do not fuse with normal sperm, demonstrating Juno's essential role in the fertility of female mice.|$|R
5|$|Cicadas {{sometimes}} {{cause damage}} to amenity shrubs and trees, {{mainly in the}} form of scarring left on tree branches where the females laid <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Branches of young trees may die as a result.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after laying <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{pollution}}. Water {{pollution is}} primarily seen in turtles and crocodilians and can affect <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> and sex characteristics. Male American alligators (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi) {{have been found}} with lowered testosterone and altered gonads in a chemically contaminated lake.|$|E
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>egg</b> {{cases are}} larger than most other skate egg cases; {{typically}} ranging from 210 to 280 mm in length and 110 to 180 mm in width.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{and unique}} character of leafhoppers is {{the production of}} brochosomes, which are thought to protect the animals, and particularly <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> clutches, from predation as well as pathogens.|$|R
50|$|Reproduction is oviviviparous. A {{clutch of}} three to seven young develop inside the mother, {{receiving}} nourishment at first from <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> yolks, but later from fluids secreted by their mother into her uterus.|$|R
5|$|In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and {{especially}} snapping turtles, {{have increased the}} predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared slider turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles. In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact painted turtles by eating <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many thrips form galls {{on plants}} when feeding or laying <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Some of the gall-forming Phlaeothripidae, such as genera Kladothrips and Oncothrips, form eusocial groups similar to ant colonies, with {{reproductive}} queens and nonreproductive soldier castes.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, {{digging into}} the {{petioles}} and stems. After emerging in late summer, they pupate in soil.|$|E
50|$|Salted Eggs - Ducks in Chaiya eat mollusks, crabs, {{and fish}} on the farm, which make <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> yolks {{particularly}} red. Eggs are covered with soil mixed with salty water and rice husks.|$|R
50|$|Papilio demodocus, {{the citrus}} {{swallowtail}} or Christmas butterfly, {{is a large}} swallowtail butterfly common to Sub-Saharan Africa. After hatching from <b>their</b> <b>egg,</b> the caterpillar feeds on a few leaves on citrus trees before pupation.|$|R
50|$|Paprika {{oleoresin}} contains natural carotenoids, and is {{made from}} chili peppers. It is used to colour cheese, orange juice, spice mixtures and packaged sauces. It is also fed to chickens to make <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> yolks more orange.|$|R
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Viduidae is {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to Africa that includes indigobirds and whydahs. All species are brood parasites, which lay <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of estrildid finches. Species usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{lifespan}} of {{the double}} drummer is {{about four or five}} weeks. During this time, they mate and reproduce, and feed exclusively on sap of living trees, sucking it out through specialised mouthparts. Female cicadas die after laying <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{butterflies}} {{can be estimated}} by the area size they inhabit, for example, in the overwintering population present in Mexico the population expressed in hectares.Butterflies can be counted in <b>their</b> <b>egg,</b> larvae and instar number.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the grave}} of the fish he had buried, Rogers talks of sad feelings. At Negri's Music Shop, he {{witnesses}} the Pittsburgh Junior Tamburitzans play. In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, the Platypus family waits for <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> to hatch.|$|R
5000|$|Females reach a {{body length}} of about 10 mm, males less than 6 mm. They are {{often found in}} seeding heads of grasses, where the females build and {{camouflage}} <b>their</b> <b>egg</b> sacs. They mainly feed on moths that visit these grasses.http://thebegavalley.org.au/11210.0.html ...|$|R
