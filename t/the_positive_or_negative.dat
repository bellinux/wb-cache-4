It exploited <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

25|$|The “A-not-A” {{question}} {{structure is}} {{commonly found in}} Chinese. The overarching principle is that of contrasting {{the positive and negative}} form of a premise side by side.

25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse. Financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data. The net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings or public willingness to pay compensation (implying the public has no legal right to {{the benefits of the}} policy) or willingness to accept compensation (implying the public has a right to the benefits of the policy) for the welfare change resulting from the policy. The guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all (categories of) parties affected by an intervention and add <b>the</b> (<b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative)</b> value, usually monetary, that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.|$|E
25|$|In {{half-wave}} rectification of a single-phase supply, also called uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> {{half of the}} AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a ramp function (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only {{one half of the}} input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more ripple than full-wave rectifiers, and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.|$|E
25|$|During school-aged years, {{academic}} achievement {{is a significant}} contributor to self-esteem development. A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem. Social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem. As children go through school, they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons {{play an important role}} in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> feelings they have about themselves. As children go through adolescence, peer influence becomes much more important. Adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends. Successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem, whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (2HNMR) is a technique that uses an external magnetic field and deuterium to replace the ordinary form of hydrogen. The ordinary form of hydrogen refers to the elemental form of hydrogen with a molecular weight of approximately 1 g/mol. It contains only one proton and has no neutrons. Deuterium is the isotope form of hydrogen which has a heavier mass compared to ordinary hydrogen. It contains one proton and neutron and has a molecular weight of approximately 2 g/mol. This technique {{can be used to}} investigate motions of acyl chains in lipids. It measures carbon and deuterium interactions and the mobility of these interactions within various regions of the lipid and also determines order parameters. The process involves using quadrupole signaling properties for examining lamellar versus non–lamellar phases as well. An external magnetic field monitors the alignment of paramagnetic compounds and uses changes in <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> magnetic spin values to detect these changes.|$|E
500|$|The codes were {{refined and}} adapted {{as they were}} used. [...] By 1867 numerals had {{been added to the}} five-needle code. [...] This was {{achieved}} through the provision of a sixth wire for common return making it possible to move just a single needle. [...] With the original five wires it was only possible to move the needles in pairs and always in opposite directions since there was no common wire provided. [...] Many more codes are theoretically possible with common return signalling, but not all of them can conveniently be used with a grid indication display. [...] The numerals were worked in by marking them {{around the edge of the}} diamond grid. [...] Needles 1 through 5 when energised to the right pointed to numerals 1 through 5 respectively, and to the left numerals 6 through 9 and 0 respectively. [...] Two additional buttons were provided on the telegraph sets to enable the common return to be connected to either <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> terminal of the battery according to the direction it was desired to move the needle.|$|E

2500|$|In {{sociology}} and psychology, self-esteem reflects a person's overall subjective emotional evaluation {{of his or}} her own worth. It is a judgment of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself, (for example, [...] "I am competent", [...] "I am worthy"), as well as emotional states, such as , despair, pride, and shame. [...] Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying [...] "The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phosphorus nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (31PNMR) {{is a type of}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} technique that utilizes 31phosphorus instead of deuterium. 31P is dependent upon changes in the mobility and [...] diffusion of a molecule. It also applies an external magnetic field to analyze the alignment of the paramagnetic compounds and uses changes in <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> magnetic spin values to detect these changes. It's useful in distinguishing between lamellar and hexagonal phases that contain phosphate groups based on their distinct patterns and signals. A disadvantage to this technique is that it is limited to phospholipids.|$|E

2500|$|In Gnostic tradition, {{the term}} Sophia (Σoφíα, Greek for [...] "wisdom") {{refers to the}} final and lowest {{emanation}} of God.

She is occasionally referred to by the Hebrew equivalent of Achamoth (this is a feature of Ptolemy's version of the Valentinian gnostic myth).

2500|$|Following the {{argument}} in the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox paper (but using the example of spin, as in David Bohm's version of the EPR argument), Bell considered an experiment {{in which there are}} [...] "a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the singlet spin state and moving freely in opposite directions." [...] The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up(+) or spin-down(−); it means, spin in <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> direction of the chosen axis.|$|E
2500|$|Roughly speaking, {{a theory}} is {{unstable}} {{if one can}} use it to encode the ordered set of natural numbers. More precisely, if there is a model M and a formula Φ(X,Y) in 2n variables X=x1,...,x'n and Y=y1,...,y'n defining a relation on [...] M'n with an infinite totally ordered subset [...] then the theory is unstable. (Any infinite totally ordered set has a subset isomorphic to either <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>or</b> <b>negative</b> integers under the usual order, so one can assume the totally ordered subset is ordered like the positive integers.) The totally ordered subset need not be definable in the theory.|$|E
