25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada. He {{is described as a}} boy full of virtues, but who is born to a demon king who is persecuting people for their independent and different religious beliefs in favor of Vishnu. Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues what he feels is right. In this legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes about a person based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination from anyone. The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>following</b> his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1973, {{while he}} was out on patrol in the park, Sullivan saw a storm cloud forming and drove away quickly.

Soon after, he was struck by a {{lightning}} bolt. Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.|$|E
25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>following</b> her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E

Shambhu Das and Indranil Bhattacharya were the sitarists, and Chandrashekhar Naringrekar played surbahar (a low-register version of the sitar). The tablist was Shankar Ghosh, although the original album credits listed him on sitar.|$|E
500|$|British foreign {{minister}} George Canning {{was concerned that}} {{in the event of}} a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted. [...] In 1823, he proposed to the American minister to Great Britain, Richard Rush, that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force. [...] Rush asked for instructions from President James Monroe. The President consulted with his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States. [...] Nevertheless, Monroe's Secretary of State, future president John Quincy Adams, felt that if the United States was going to set forth its principles, it should speak for itself and not seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>following</b> the lead of powerful Britain. [...] Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.|$|E

In the second episode review, Beveridge said it [...] "seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>following</b> much the same kind of pace and structure" [...] as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; [...] ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a [...] "gritty" [...] animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is [...] "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept". He said it is not [...] "a great show", but that [...] "it gives us something different than the usual"the reason it is [...] "enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|Mike Wass, {{a writer}} for Idolator, wrote that [...] "Lovebird" [...] {{was one of the}} two best songs on Glassheart, along with the title track. He further commented that it had strong radio potential, {{and that it would be}} {{successful}} if it were to be released in the United States, as it sounds like a [...] "clone" [...] of [...] "Bleeding Love". Digital Spy critic Lewis Corner felt that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] as well as [...] "Better in Time". Although he noted that Lewis' vocal performance on [...] "Lovebird" [...] is very impressive, as with all her material, he was unsure of why it was included on the final cut of the album due to Glassheart having [...] "bigger" [...] songs on it, which were likely to chart better. [...] The Mirrors Clemmie Moodie thought that although the recording is a [...] "catchy" [...] song, it does not compare to [...] "Bleeding Love", but noted that it does contain [...] "lyrical gems", including “Your lovebird's flyin’ away, ’cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". Hermoine Hoby, writing on behalf of The Observer, wrote that Lewis appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>following</b> in the footsteps of singer-songwriter Adele, due to the inclusion of [...] "big heartfelt ballads" [...] such as [...] "Lovebird" [...] and [...] "Fireflies" [...] on Glassheart. For Hoby, Lewis' vocals are just as [...] "technically irreproachable" [...] as Whitney Houston's and Mariah Carey's.|$|E
500|$|The nationalists, on {{the other}} hand, ignored the agreed terms and used the sudden {{cessation}} of security force activity {{as an opportunity to}} regroup and re-establish themselves {{both inside and outside the}} country. Guerrilla operations continued: an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months. Far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation, the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave the message to the rural population that the security forces had been defeated, and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO's victory in Mozambique. ZANU and ZANLA were unable to totally capitalise on the situation, however, because of internal conflict which had started earlier in 1974. Some ordinary ZANU cadres perceived the ZANU High Command members in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>following</b> a luxurious lifestyle, contrary to the party's Maoist principles. This culminated in the Nhari rebellion of November 1974, in which mutinous guerrillas were forcibly put down by the ZANU defence chief, Josiah Tongogara. The ZANU and ZAPU leaders imprisoned in Rhodesia were released in December 1974 as part of the [...] "détente" [...] deal. Robert Mugabe had been elected ZANU president while they were incarcerated, though this was disputed by its founding leader, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, who continued to be recognised as such by the Frontline States. On his release, Mugabe moved into Mozambique to consolidate his supremacy within ZANU and ZANLA, while Sithole prepared to take part in talks with the Rhodesian government as part of the UANC delegation. Sithole retained the ZANU leadership in the eyes of the Frontline States until late 1975.|$|E

Today these concerns continue through multiple collaborations across the fields of poetry, dance, translation, and the visual arts.
