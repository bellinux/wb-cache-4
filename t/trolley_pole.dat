5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles.|$|E
25|$|A <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> is a tapered {{cylindrical}} pole of wood {{or metal}} placed {{in contact with}} an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley car. The <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> sits atop a sprung base {{on the roof of}} the trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent. Official credit for the invention of the electric <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> has gone to an American, Frank J. Sprague, who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|E
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, the <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> {{has given}} way to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the <b>trolley</b> <b>pole,</b> the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E
50|$|Following electrification, Glasgow trams were {{initially}} fitted with <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> to take electricity from the overhead wires. The <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> were later replaced with bow collectors.|$|R
25|$|Trams {{or light}} rail cars {{equipped}} with pantographs normally cannot operate on lines with overhead wiring designed for trolley-pole collection. For this reason, these systems {{and a few}} others worldwide retain use of <b>trolley</b> <b>poles,</b> even on new streetcars (except in Riga), {{in order to avoid the}} difficulty and expense of modifying long stretches of existing overhead wires to accept pantographs. However, the Toronto Transit Commission is converting streetcar overhead to be compatible with both <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> and pantographs. (The older CLRV and ALRV streetcars use only <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> while the newer Flexity Outlook are equipped for both <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> and pantographs.) Along Queens Quay West, since September 12, 2017, streetcars for route 510 Spadina use <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> while those for 509 Harbourfront use pantographs along the same section of track.|$|R
2500|$|All trolleybuses use <b>trolley</b> <b>poles,</b> {{and thus}} <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> remain in use worldwide, {{wherever}} trolleybuses are in operation (some 315 cities [...] ), and several manufacturers {{continue to make}} them, including Vossloh-Kiepe, Å koda and Lekov.|$|R
25|$|Most {{interurban}} {{cars and}} freight locomotives collected current from an overhead trolley wire. The cars contacted this wire {{through the use}} of a <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> or a pantograph. Others designs collected current from a third rail. Some interurbans used both: in open country, the third rail was used and in town, a <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> was raised. An example of this was the Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin Railroad where a <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> was used in both Aurora and Elgin, Illinois. Third rail was cheaper to maintain and more conductive, but it was more expensive to construct initially and it did not eliminate the need for AC transformers, AC transmission lines, and AC/DC conversion systems. In addition, third rail posed a serious danger to trespassers and animals and was difficult to keep clear of ice.|$|E
25|$|The tramcars are {{powered by}} 600 V {{overhead}} wire with electricity {{transmitted to the}} tramcars by pantograph and a few vintage trams by <b>trolley</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leeds 399 was {{the second}} {{passenger}} tram to arrive at Crich (being superseded only by Cardiff 131 a works car, and Leeds 345), however it faced a lengthy restoration, returning only to service in 1991. It is fitted with a <b>trolley</b> <b>pole,</b> without a rope, meaning that it can use trolley reversers at the termini. It is currently in the operational pool, after undergoing remedial work to the exterior paintwork.|$|E
50|$|The Boeing LRV's {{and their}} successors use {{pantograph}} current collection, except under unimproved overhead where only a few, equipped with <b>trolley</b> <b>poles,</b> operated for non-revenue purposes. Meanwhile, the PCC cars used <b>trolley</b> <b>poles.</b> The overhead {{for the entire}} Highland Branch was modified to handle both <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> and pantographs, with short runners installed at each switch frog to guide the pantographs past. The overall structure of the overhead remained unchanged for several more years.|$|R
50|$|All {{cars have}} had {{pantograph}} current collection equipment added to them, as the overhead contact system that MTS operates is not compatible with <b>trolley</b> <b>poles.</b> The {{cars on the}} Silver Line retain their <b>trolley</b> <b>poles,</b> however, for visual effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} {{point in the}} whole line is the railway underpass at the Rimini railway station. It has a tight bend and limited clearance, forcing the trolleybuses to flatten their <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> near their roofs, with {{the risk that the}} <b>trolley</b> <b>poles</b> will come off the wires.|$|R
25|$|The {{introductory}} {{rolling stock}} was single-coach, {{like at the}} time, in other Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kanpur), because the new mode of transport was experimental. Since it gained popularity quickly, another coach was attached some years later (as in Mumbai), which is now standard. Double decker trams (like Mumbai's) were never used in Kolkata. Triple-coach trams were unsuccessfully tried. Single-coach trams were used on the Shibpur line until its closure in 1970. Later stock was of the SLT type. It was double-coach with three doors, four wheels under each coach and no wheels between coaches. SLT trams had no front iron net, but had a front-coach <b>trolley</b> <b>pole.</b> The both-end type had a front iron net and a rear-coach <b>trolley</b> <b>pole.</b> SLTs were the first double-coach trams, introduced only on the Kolkata side of the Hooghly River (not on the Howrah side). These were gradually replaced by articulated trams on all routes. The SLC type was introduced much later on the Bandhaghat line, and continued until its closure in 1971; after that, SLC trams began running on the G/H and T/G lines on the Kolkata side. Articulated trams were in use until 1989.|$|E
25|$|On {{some older}} systems, the poles were raised and lowered using a long pole {{with a metal}} hook. Where available, these may have been made of bamboo due to its length, natural {{straightness}} and strength, combined with its relative light weight {{and the fact that}} it is an insulator. Trolleybuses usually carried one with the vehicle, for use in the event of dewirement, but tram systems usually had them placed along the route at locations where the <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> would need reversing.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century onwards, horse-drawn trams or horsecars were used in cities around the world. In the late 1880s {{electrically}} powered street railways became technically feasible following the invention of a <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> system of collecting current by American inventor Frank J. Sprague who installed the first successful system at Richmond, Virginia. They became popular because roads were then poorly surfaced, and before {{the invention of the}} internal combustion engine and the advent of motor-buses, they were the only practical means of public transport around cities.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of interurbans {{in the late}} nineteenth century resulted from the convergence of two trends: improvements in electric traction, and an untapped demand for transportation in rural areas, particularly in the Midwestern United States. The 1880s saw the first successful deployments of electric traction in streetcar systems. Most of these built on the pioneering work of Frank J. Sprague, who developed an improved method for mounting an electric traction motor and using a <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> for pickup. Sprague's work led to widespread acceptance of electric traction for streetcar operations and end of horse-drawn trams.|$|E
25|$|They {{remained}} in regular service until {{the closure of}} the inland routes during 1963. The fleet was reduced to eight and renumbered 600â607, with 229, 231, 232 and 234 being mothballed and scrapped in 1968. In the early 1990s the boats were refurbished and received new liveries, including AEC Routemaster red, blue and yellow and a fictitious wartime livery. Two were experimentally converted from <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> to pantograph conductors but they were soon converted back as passengers complained at being showered by grease and dirt from the power line when it rained.|$|E
25|$|Many {{improvements}} {{took place}} at Trent Bridge at this time, and in June 1920 an automatic <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> reverser was installed. This did not remain in use long, as the principal terminus was shortly afterwards removed {{to the end of}} Victoria Embankment, a new kerbside loading line being put in at the same time. The old terminus by the bridge approach remained in use for football and other specials. A new single-track line was laid along the Embankment and Bathley Street to Trent Bridge Depot, the entrance to the depot was altered, and a new shed to hold 25 cars was built {{on the opposite side of}} Turney Street.|$|E

25|$|Trolley is an American word {{derived from}} the {{electric}} current pickup mechanism in early systems. The first successful electric streetcars in the United States used a system devised by Frank J. Sprague, in which a spring-loaded <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> pushed a small trolley wheel up against an overhead wire to collect electricity for the motors. Although not the first overhead collection system, it was far more reliable than its predecessors, and eventually became used by almost all streetcars. Some authorities believe that the vehicle became known as a trolley car because it reminded people (particularly on the West Coast) of a boat trolling for fish. Others believe it derived from a dialect word for a wheeled cart.|$|E
25|$|Richmond emerged {{a decade}} after the {{smoldering}} rubble of the Civil War to resume its position as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and <b>trolley</b> <b>pole</b> to collect current, with electric motors on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.|$|E
