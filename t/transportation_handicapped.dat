40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to suggest a package layout {{guideline}} for low-floor bus by interview with passengers and observations of their behavior. Background: Increasing attention has been introduced the low-floor bus to be more suitable for use by <b>transportation</b> <b>handicapped.</b> Complex issues are involved in providing comfortable services to all people. We are going to suggest package layout guidelines for more comfortable and suitable travel to all people. Method: The two times of survey and video observation sessions were conducted on low-floor buses in Seoul; (1) a finding of potential issues in the first session, (2) a confirming of issues from the last session. Results: The three of major issues were founded in this study; (1) difficulties in supporting body when standing, (2) difficulties in sitting on front wheel pan seat, (3) difficulties in passing through the aisle. Conclusion: There were clear differences between public and <b>transportation</b> <b>handicapped</b> in using some tools which are used for support body such as roof hand rails, side hand rails, and hand rail rings. Some of design problems were founded to improve from the perspective of ergonomics and universal design. Such differences and design guidelines have to be considered in bus design as well as commercial vehicle. Application: The proposed design guideline...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} supports the notion that fea-tures of the environment, such as street connectivity, housing density, and safety, are linked to physical activity in older adults (1 – 6). Whether the community environment is related to an older person’s participation in their daily role activities (i. e., disability) is unclear. Disability is hypothesized to result from an interaction between the person, level of dis-ease and impairment, and the environment (7 – 11). In theory, a greater presence of mobility barriers in an older person’s community (e. g., curb cuts or uneven walking surfaces) should {{be associated with a}} higher degree of disability, whereas more facilitators in the community (e. g., public <b>transportation</b> and <b>handicap</b> parking) should be related to less disability. Mobility barriers clearly are present in the community (12 – 17), and older adults frequently report that they have difficulty with physical elements of their environment (18) ...|$|R

40|$|Demand Response Transit (DRT) is a {{critical}} form of <b>transportation</b> for <b>handicapped,</b> low income, and small/ medium sized communities. This type of service, which transports riders through an on-demand basis, is commonly used in communities that are not dense enough to support a fixed route transit system. Unfortunately, DRT systems face many challenges that restrict how well they can serve their community, including limited funding, understaffing, aging fleets, a lack of technical support, a lack of quantification of level of service standards, and limited modeling/planning practices. This report discusses {{the implementation of a}} unique DRT Accessibility Tool developed for the Texas Department of Transportation that addresses these challenges by determining how well a DRT system serves its riders and the most efficient ways to improve this service. The DRT Accessibility Tool, which is developed in Microsoft Access based on DRT travel logs, service characteristics and surveys from Brownsville, Texas, uses a system of models to simulate actual daily DRT travel patterns. Ultimately, DRT operators can use the Accessibility Tool in two robust ways. First, they can evaluate their current accessibility levels for various combinations of population groups, times of day, and travel purposes. Second, the Accessibility Too...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Open Vehicle Routing Problem (OVRP) is {{a version}} of the well known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), in which each route ends at the last served customer. The {{objective}} of the OVRP is to deliver a set of customers with known demands on minimum-cost vehicle routes originating and at a depot. Each vehicle has a maximum capacity. We study the following variants of this problem: the number of vehicles is unlimited or not and the demand of each customer is equals to one. This last version originates in the <b>transportation</b> of <b>handicapped</b> people which is the final goal of our study. For addressing these problems, we propose an Iterated Local Search combined with a Tabu Search on multiple neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are generated from Ejection Chains and Path Exchange moves. The Path Exchange operator removes two non consecutive paths and reinserts each path at the other position. It can be used as intra or inter route exchange operator. Our ejection chains are produced from performing infeasible moves and then repairing the incumbent solution. Experimental tests show that our method is competitive with the most advances solutions techniques in the literature and suitable for the case of the demand equal to one...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the pickup and {{delivery}} traveling salesman problem. First we show how to adapt some classical traveling salesman heuristics to solve this problem, then we propose a new and e$cient composite heuristic. The proposed heuristic is composed of two phases: a solution construction phase including a local optimization component and a deletion and re-insertion improvement phase. To evaluate its performance, the proposed heuristic was compared to the only available heuristic specially designed to solve this problem, to an adaptation of the most e$cient heuristic designed to solve the traveling salesman problem with backhaul, to an adaptation of the farthest {{as well as to}} an adaptation of the cheapest insertion methods. Each of these heuristics was followed by our deletion and re-insertion procedure which considerably improved their performance. Results based on a new set of test problems show that the proposed heuristic outperforms all these reinforced heuristics. Scope and purpose In several physical distribution problems, goods must be picked at an origin and delivered to a destination. Examples include the <b>transportation</b> of <b>handicapped</b> persons, the pickup and delivery of fast courier, of some medical supplies, etc. This problem di!ers from classical transportation problems because we have to dea...|$|R

40|$|The {{role for}} the {{transition}} team leader (TTL) has not been formalized {{at the state level}} in Texas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the current perceptions of the public school superintendents in Texas for the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the TTL. The framework of the survey questionnaire was based on eight categories of expertise for the TTL derived from a review of the literature and from professional experience in preparing handicapped individuals for the world of work. The findings are listed as desirable and undesirable characteristics for the role or job description of the TTL. The desirable characteristics for the role of TTL were viewed as: (a) having experience with handicapped populations, (b) having skills to supervise others, (c) being a liaison between agencies, (d) making program adjustments as needed, (e) providing training, (f) knowing how to explain the transition program to staff, (g) being a liaison with parents, (h) being a liaison with community employers, (i) knowing pertinent regulations, (j) knowing the characteristics for each of the handicapping conditions, and (k) knowing the options and barriers to <b>transportation</b> for <b>handicapped</b> individuals in the community. The least desirable characteristics identified with the role of the TTL were: (a) The need for certification of the TTL, (b) making curricular changes at the elementary level, (c) the TTL as the Educational Diagnostician, (d) the TTL as a parent of a handicapped individual participating in the transition program, and (e) the TTL encouraging severely handicapped individuals to remain in the public schools until the maximum age of 21. These categorical data were grouped by ESC area with urban, suburban, and rural demographics. These data were analyzed by a three-way ANOVA design and significant differences were found by category, by ESC area, and by population designation. The public school superintendents have perceived the role of the TTL as a new position, community-based, community-oriented, transferable, and requiring no additional certification procedures...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to advance the rights of {{handicapped}} people to use mass transportation, the Department of Transportation has enacted a series of regulations that required facilities to be updated to allow for effective use by the handicapped, including the non-ambulatory wheelchair bound. As part of these regulations, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act contained a general clause prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped by recipients of federal funds. The legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act {{makes it clear that}} Congress intended the handicapped to be integrated into mainstream society. Imposition of such a dichotomy, moreover runs afoul of the Federal-Aid Highway Act which requires effective use of mass <b>transportation</b> for the <b>handicapped</b> - mobility. While section 5042 ̆ 7 s early history was closely tied with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress, courts, and administrative agencies have increasingly lost sight of the statute 2 ̆ 7 s genesis. What began as a humanitarian gesture to give the handicapped substantive statutory equal protection rights has since disintegrated into yet another 2 ̆ 2 symbolic law 2 ̆ 2 with practically no enforcement muscle behind it. The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s conclusion that affirmative action is not generally required in a cause of action based exclusively on section 504 placed an onerous burden on the handicapped. While the DOT regulations, governed in part by section 504, specify the steps which must be taken to make mass transit accessible, federal fund recipients, the MTA in particular, have evidence their reluctance to comply and have been lent an increasingly sympathetic ear by the federal government. Thus, handicapped groups will have to be innovative in finding rights conferred by statutes other than section 504...|$|R
