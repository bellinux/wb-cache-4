50|$|The {{solution}} {{then was}} to build new prison facilities <b>to</b> <b>de-bottleneck</b> the short-stay prisons. In 2002, the «13 0000 program» was launched to create new reception centres in regions which suffer from a shortage of places.

40|$|Abstract — The {{complexities}} of the process plant are increasingly becoming hard <b>to</b> <b>de-bottleneck</b> {{as a result of}} continuous new development in technology. This has resulted in a need to check design for errors and omissions, a task which has traditionally been carried out on individual basis. A typical process plant is generally associated with three major hazards namely, toxic hazard, fire hazard and explosive hazard. The hazard question is a complicated one as it involves the degree of hazard, precautionary steps taken to prevent the initiation of the hazard and adequacy of the protection of personnel as well as facilities. The Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) on a generalized process plant serves to identify the safety problems associated with the plant and also helps to improve process safety and to eliminate potential hazard points...|$|E
30|$|The European {{rail freight}} industry, {{developed}} on a domestic focus with powerful incumbent railway undertakings, {{has not yet}} developed the necessary collaborative or integrated approach needed {{for the kind of}} total pan-European transport chain widely practiced by maritime shipping lines, for example. There are various reasons for this, including the fact that the multiple actors in multimodal transport chains have, at times, opposing interests. This, coupled with the high level of entry barriers faced by private new entrants, has failed to generate the development of industrialised, pan‐European services to respond to market needs. Moreover, no modern studies of this market have been conducted to evaluate its evolution, anticipate the needed revolution, or suggest new business models suitable to face the challenges due to, among other things, the protectionist attitude of the incumbents towards their market share. The bundling of the various categories of traffic (bulk, containers), the creation of efficient nodes <b>to</b> <b>de-bottleneck</b> by optimising the use of existing infrastructure, the development of fully interoperable Trans‐European Rail Freight Corridors with a powerful governance platform, and coordination with national infrastructure managers, are all progressing too slowly. Overcoming the patchwork of national safety rules, through powerful action by the European Railway Agency (ERA), is progressively arriving at an urgent need to increase the pace. All of these elements have hindered the introduction of pan-European rail services.|$|E

The fluid catalytic cracker and a diesel hydro desulphuriser were commissioned in November 2006.The FCC and DHDS plants were modified so as to be compliant with the cleaner Euro III and Euro IV fuels. The refinery configuration lends itself well <b>to</b> <b>de-bottlenecking</b> and its capacity is enhanced to 14mtpa in 2009.The docking facilities include an SBM capable of handling vessels up to 350,000DWT with a capacity of 25mtpa, tankages with interconnecting pipelines of 20mtpa capacity, marine product dispatch capacity of 12mtpa and rail-car and truck-loading facilities.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the conveyancing process in South Africa with a view to identify how the process might be improved in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness. Land is an asset and still remains a valuable factor in production, even in the modern knowledge economy. In many parts of the world, land is a limited resource, therefore, in most countries, custodianship and ownership of land and landed properties generally tend to be guarded through the meticulous capturing, recording and storage of appropriate data and information. Legislative provisions for the transfer of custodianship and/or ownership require the involvement of a variety of role players in the conveyancing processes that culminate in the registration of land and associated immovable property. In some countries, the conveyancing processes tend to be complex and cumbersome. The study provides a conceptual framework for conveyancing processes based on a content-based review of land and immovable property registration systems in five countries, namely, Barbados, the Netherlands, Australia, Taiwan and South Africa. The study further investigates the South African conveyancing processes. Quantitative questionnaires were completed by six respondent groups from the conveyancing service chain, and qualitative interviews were conducted with two of the four major banks in South Africa. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The findings were used <b>to</b> develop a <b>de-bottlenecking</b> framework for South African conveyancing. Business ManagementM. Com. (Business Management...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide an {{overview}} of the epidemiology of COPD in India which is one of the most affected countries in the world and contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity of this disease; to provide insights into the etiological determinants of COPD in India; comment on treatment aspects including drug treatment, adherence to guidelines, treatment of exacerbations and to try to comment on whether it differs significantly from rest of the world. The article reviews published literature on COPD in India; provides insight into comparative methodologies involved; comments on gaps in knowledge and suggests areas of further research such as Prescription Audit. India contributes very significantly to mortality from COPD 102. 3 / 100, 000 and 6, 740, 000 DALYs out of world total of 27, 756, 000 DALYs; thus significantly affecting health related Quality of Life in the country. COPD is surpassing Malaria, TB even today and the gap would get wider with time in near future. The lack of robust real time nation-wide data does plague India as well, however multiple studies from 1994 to 2010 show increasing trends of COPD morbidity and mortality. Since most inhalational drugs are available in the country there is no reason why mortality should not be comparable to rest of the world but there is poor adherence to treatment guidelines, both national and international. Urban centers in India are comparable to their global counterparts in terms of service quality and facilities and this is also work in progress. However, the rural hinterland is poorly serviced; national GDP spending on health is remarkably low. Some innovation is emerging and that could be the harbinger of a new future if properly nurtured. The article is an overview of COPD in India with emphasis on understanding the multi-dimensional nature of the problem and an attempt of providing insight into possible <b>de-bottlenecking</b> <b>to</b> reduce the pain and suffering of millions of COPD patients in India in future...|$|R
