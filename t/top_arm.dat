25|$|These {{scenes are}} on the main, lower, section of the shaft, which was broken above the largest scenes, and {{possibly}} the two sections were not restored the right way round. Above the large scene {{on the north side}} is either John the Baptist holding a lamb, or possibly God the Father holding the Lamb of God, who opens a book as in Apocalypse 5:1-10. Above this (and another break) are two remaining figures of the Four Evangelists with their symbols that originally were on the four arms of the cross-head: St. Matthew on the lowest arm, and St. John the Evangelist on the <b>top</b> <b>arm.</b> The side arms and centre roundel of the cross are replacements, of purely speculative (and most improbable) design.|$|E
500|$|The sash of the Order was poppy red moire {{with narrow}} green borders, {{but under the}} knot, {{at the ends of}} this sash, these green borders as well as the ends of the sash were covered with gold {{metallic}} ribbon. Like the sash of the Order of the Garter this sash was worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. [...] The cross worn with this sash was a Maltese cross with narrow arms also enameled white strewn with numerous golden flames, with three straight rays between each arm, each point of the cross being tipped with a small gold ball. Between the two gold balls on the <b>top</b> <b>arm</b> of the cross was a three-dimensional gold representation of the Bavarian crown, by which the cross hung from its sash. In the center of the cross was a large round medallion consisting of a small golden representation of the conversion of Saint Hubert against a green enamel background and surrounded by a wide border in red enamel with the motto the order In trau vast in Gothic letters set with small diamonds. On the reverse, {{in the center of the}} cross was a golden representation in relief of the imperial orb and cross (i.e., the heraldic symbol of the Prince-Elector as the Arch-Steward of the Holy Roman Empire) against a red enamel background and surrounded with a white enamel scroll-like border with the inscription In memoriam recuperatae dignitatis aviate.

2500|$|The Soviet {{and early}} Russian Federation Order of Alexander Nevsky was a silver, 50mm wide and high ruby-red enamelled, five-pointed convex star {{superimposed}} on a decagon composed of polished diverging rays. The star had gold-plated rims and edges. In {{the center of}} the star, a central medallion bearing the left profile relief image of a helmeted Alexander Nevsky and the inscription along the left and right circumference in prominent letters [...] "ALEXANDER NEVSKY" [...] (...) [...] [...] The central medallion was surrounded by a gilt laurel wreath bisected at its base by a silver shield bearing the hammer and sickle, the shield is superimposed over gilded sword, spear, bow and quiver of arrows. [...] Two gilt pollaxes cross behind the central medallion, their outward facing blades protruding {{on either side of the}} five pointed star's <b>top</b> <b>arm</b> and extending slightly past the decagon's outer edge, their base visible just inside of the star's two lower arms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{swing and}} row simply {{consists}} of the vaulter swinging the trail leg forward and rowing the pole, bringing the <b>top</b> <b>arm</b> down to the hips, while {{trying to keep the}} trail leg straight to store more potential energy into the pole, the rowing motion also keeps the pole bent {{for a longer period of}} time for the vaulter to get into optimum position. Once in a [...] "U" [...] shape the left arm hugs the pole tight to efficiently use the recoil within the pole. The goal is to carry out these motions as thoroughly and as quickly as possible; it is a race against the unbending of the pole. Effectively, this causes a double pendulum motion, with the top of the pole moving forward and pivoting from the box, while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand. This action gives the vaulter the best position possible to be [...] "ejected" [...] off the pole. The swing continues until the hips are above the head and the arms are pulling the pole close to the chest; from there the vaulter shoots their legs up over the cross bar while keeping the pole close.|$|E
