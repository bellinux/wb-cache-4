5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> issue, in 1806 Hinde {{moved from}} Kentucky to Chillicothe {{in the free}} state of Ohio. In {{partnership}} with his brother-in-law R.D. Richardson, beginning in 1806, he edited and published a newspaper titled the Fredonian. Fredonian was a sonorous name for 'a citizen of the United States.' In later years it was applied to an American-inspired rebellion to separate Texas from Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or <b>the</b> <b>slavery.</b> Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in the prehistory.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society {{was founded}} in Britain, {{dedicated}} to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire; <b>the</b> <b>Slavery</b> Abolition Act 1833 represented the achievement of their goal. The Zong massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; in 1839, Thomas Clarkson published his History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade, which included an account of killings.|$|E

5|$|In later years, Wilberforce {{supported}} {{the campaign for}} the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to <b>the</b> <b>Slavery</b> Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery {{in most of the}} British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and {{manipulated}} {{and won the}} nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on {{his reputation as a}} moderate on <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.|$|E
5|$|One month later, the House of Lords passed <b>the</b> <b>Slavery</b> Abolition Act, which {{abolished}} {{slavery in}} most of the British Empire from August 1834. They voted plantation owners £20million in compensation, giving full emancipation to children younger than six, and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, British Honduras and Canada. Nearly 800,000 African slaves were freed, the vast majority in the Caribbean.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Old School and New School factions merged with <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> controversy. The New School's enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies {{was evident in}} its increasing identification with the abolitionist movement. The Old School, however, {{was convinced that the}} General Assembly and the larger church should not legislate on moral issues that were not explicitly addressed in the Bible. This effectively drove the majority of Southern Presbyterians to support the Old School faction.|$|E
5|$|This process {{affected}} the southern and western parts of present-day Mali most significantly, {{but in the}} northern and eastern parts of the colony large numbers of slaves remained in servitude to their masters. According to rough estimates, throughout the area of present-day Mali about one-third of former slaves moved away from <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> relationship, while two-thirds remained with their masters. In the 1920s, most Tuareg households still had slaves who tended {{to the house and}} animals.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|Judah Benjamin {{was sworn}} in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues {{included}} Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. <b>The</b> <b>slavery</b> issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of the New Mexico–Texas border was unsettled {{at the time of}} Taylor's inauguration. The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within their borders, despite having no significant presence there. Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> debate in Congress. The Texas government, under newly instated governor P. Hansborough Bell, tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Angered {{over his}} electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even {{challenging}} {{one to a}} duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph's behalf. Jennings focused on <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> issue and tied Randolph to Harrison's continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory's pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory. Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory. Jennings's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison's pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings's and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.|$|E

5|$|As {{the country}} {{continued}} to expand, {{the issue of}} slavery in its new territories became the dominant national issue. The Southern position was that slaves were property and therefore could be moved to the territories like all other forms of property. The 1820 Missouri Compromise provided for the admission of Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, preserving the Senate's equality between the regions. In 1846, the Wilmot Proviso was introduced to a war appropriations bill to ban slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War; the Proviso repeatedly passed the House, but not the Senate. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the issue by admitting California as a free state, instituting a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, banning the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and allowing New Mexico and Utah self-determination on <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> issue.|$|E
5|$|Even as the act {{was being}} debated, {{settlers}} {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as Bleeding Kansas. Thousands of pro-slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When Free-Staters set up a shadow government, and drafted the Topeka Constitution, Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the Topeka government.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{hoped that}} he would be a {{compromise}} candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over <b>the</b> <b>slavery</b> question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator John Bell running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln. The election of Lincoln, known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} argues that, in Rhode Island, <b>the</b> {{institution of}} <b>slavery,</b> <b>the</b> process of emancipation and circumscribed black freedom was fundamentally influenced by <b>the</b> businesses of <b>slavery.</b> <b>The</b> businesses of <b>slavery</b> include <b>the</b> West Indian rum and slave trade, the Atlantic slave {{trade and the}} negro cloth industry.
