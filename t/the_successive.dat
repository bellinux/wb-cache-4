The islands also came under attack from Vikings during the early Historic period.|$|E
50|$|The 1922-23 {{season was}} Port Vale's fourth {{consecutive}} season of football (17th overall) in the Football League. For <b>the</b> third <b>successive</b> <b>the</b> season the club finished {{just out of}} the relegation zones, and for <b>the</b> second <b>successive</b> season were unable to find a regular goalscorer following the sale of Bobby Blood. Financial issues continued to be a concern, especially when a former trainer reported the club for making illegal payments.|$|R

We {{consider}} <b>the</b> modulus-based <b>successive</b> overrelaxation met-hod for {{the linear}} complementarity problems from the discretization of Black-Scholes American options model. The H+-matrix {{property of the}} system matrix discretized from American option pricing which guaran-tees the convergence of the proposed method for the linear complementar-ity problem is analyzed. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis, and further show that <b>the</b> modulus-based <b>successive</b> overrelax-ation method is superior to <b>the</b> classical projected <b>successive</b> overrelaxation method with optimal parameter...|$|R
5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the Russian Empire as <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> Third Rome was kept alive until its demise with the Russian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in {{a classic}} style of design, with the first cover a {{watercolour}} and pencil drawing by illustrator Thomas Taylor showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font Cochin Bold. The first releases of <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first Cliff Wright and then Jason Cockroft.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E
5|$|Large {{jumps in}} <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> molar {{ionization}} energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, {{the first two}} molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730kJ/mol, {{for the removal of}} a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell also {{investigated}} the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, {{to such an}} extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} the islands has been {{affected}} by <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands.

5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four Emperors, which saw <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> {{rise and fall of}} the {{emperors}} Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, but despite the fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.|$|E
5|$|When helium is {{exhausted}} at {{the core}} of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Aqil {{secured a}} durable {{alliance}} with the Beni Sakhr, consecrated through his marriage to a woman from the tribe. From Transjordan, he and his band of irregulars raided areas {{on both sides of}} the Jordan River until he was invited back to the Galilee by Acre's kaimakam in 1847. The latter had sought to neutralize Aqil and his allies' marauding activities, and thus pardoned Aqil. He was also given command of 75 bashi-bazouk in Lower Galilee. Thereafter, he was commissioned with overseeing that region's security. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> governors of Acre entrusted him with protecting the Galilee's trade routes and maintaining general security in the area, which he did successfully. With time, he became an unofficial mutasallim (tax collector) for much of northern Palestine, including the Jezreel Valley, Safad, Tiberias and Nazareth. The tax he collected was not on behalf of the authorities, but rather a tribute payment (khuwwa) to receive his protection. While this unofficial system proved successful in guaranteeing local security, later historians criticized it as akin to a protection racket.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's goalscoring chance came in {{the fifth}} minute when Poyet found Di Matteo, who fumbled his {{opportunity}} as it went over the goal. Stuttgart almost took the lead through Bobic, who took advantage of Steve Clarke's poor clearance but Bobic's attempt went just past the right goalpost. The Germans continued to push forward, as Balakov had a chance on goal, after being found by Poschner, but his shot was kept out by Ed de Goey to mark the first save of the match. Chelsea held on however; a few minutes later, Poyet ran towards the ball to direct a powerful volley on goal following a weak clearing header from Berthold, but a well-placed Franz Wohlfahrt dived to read the attempt. Chelsea had another chance before half time, which saw Wise from a Di Matteo free kick launch another volley, with <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> effort going just off the target.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> offensives {{of early}} August, exact Canadian {{casualties}} for Operation Tractable {{are not known}} but losses during Totalize and Tractable are put at 5,500 men. German casualties during Operation Tractable are also uncertain; approximate figures can be found for casualties within the Falaise Pocket {{but not for the}} Canadian operations during Tractable. After the Falaise Pocket, the German 7th Army was severely depleted, having lost from 50,000–200,000 men, over 200 tanks, 1,000 guns and 5,000 other vehicles. In the fighting around Hill262, the Germans lost 2,000 men killed, 5,000 taken prisoner, 55 tanks, 44 guns and 152 armoured vehicles. Polish casualties for Operation Tractable (until 22 August) are 1,441 men, of whom 325 were killed (including 21 officers), 1,002 were wounded (35 officers) and 114 missing, which includes 263 men lost before the Chambois and Ormel actions from 14–18 August.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (reigned 604–618), the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest in the provinces, while <b>the</b> <b>successive</b> military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy ("Mandate of Heaven") among the provincial governors. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, {{and by the time}} he realized the gravity of the situation, it was too late: as revolts spread, in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
