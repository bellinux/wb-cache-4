5|$|Although {{science fiction}} had been {{published}} in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. By the end of the 1930s, the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> several titles. By the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. If was launched {{in the middle of this}} second publishing boom.|$|E
5|$|Although textile-related {{engineering}} declined {{with the}} processing industry, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers Ferranti in 1896. Ferranti went into receivership in 1993, {{but some of}} its former works continue in other hands. Part of the original Hollinwood site was operated by Siemens Metering and Semiconductor divisions. The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.|$|E
5|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} {{first appeared in}} the 1920s with the appearance of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. The beginnings of science fiction as a separately marketed genre can be traced to this time, {{and by the end of}} the 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> several titles. By the late 1940s the market began to recover again. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954.

5|$|Before {{entering}} production, Kill the Irishman had {{a troubled}} development stage that lasted over a decade. Production commenced in 2009, with filming {{taking place in}} and around Detroit. The film chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of Danny Greene. He worked as a longshoreman in the Cleveland docks, until being chosen to serve as interim president in 1961. In 1964, he was convicted of embezzling $11,500 of the union's funds. After his conviction, Greene rose through the criminal underworld in Cleveland, and waged war on the Mafia for control of the city. After many failed attempts, Greene was assassinated on October 6, 1977 by contract killer Ray Ferritto. His death ultimately led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the Cleveland Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during {{the early part of}} the 1st century. One such family, the Flavians, or gens Flavia, rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Domitian's great-grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> {{many of his}} proposals, {{regardless}} of their merits. He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and, though the idea had been proposed by previous governors, Slaughter devised a means of funding it. The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including {{the creation of a}} state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E
50|$|A puzzle game spinoff of the Dreamcast game Animastar, titled Animastar Puzzle, was {{announced}} in early 2000 but was later cancelled, presumably due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sudden <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dreamcast console.|$|R

5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large number of its eggs to collection contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British {{army officer}} and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{who served as}} Vice-Chamberlain {{during the reign of}} King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to seek medical attention for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration for the name of the Hawaiian ukulele.|$|E

5|$|In {{the episodes}} {{following}} the break up, Rachel and Ross are initially hostile towards each other. The exes continue to harbor feelings for each other. During a beach house vacation with their friends, Rachel and Ross briefly reconcile when he ends {{his relationship with}} Bonnie (Christine Taylor), only to break up once again due to a disagreement. During season four, Rachel dates her customer Joshua (Tate Donovan), while Ross dates her boss' niece Emily (Helen Baxendale), to whom he eventually gets engaged. Competitively, Rachel proposes to recent divorcee Joshua, frightening him off. Rachel indirectly contributes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> Ross and Emily's relationship when he accidentally utters Rachel's name while exchanging their wedding vows. Ross ultimately divorces a jealous Emily, choosing his friendship with Rachel instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} Norman Shaw, then aged 73, {{was brought}} in to draw up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were felt to be unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition and retailers' demand for bigger display windows. Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw's designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928. Significantly, no accommodation was built above any of the retail properties, contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the West End as a place of residence. A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause for}} the {{extinction}} of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals. Péron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the bird by hunting it, and perhaps by starting fires. Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed no fewer than 300 emus himself. Cooper {{had been on the}} island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may have killed 3,600 emus by the time Péron visited them.|$|E
50|$|Another Theriot audit {{began with}} an inquiry into a toy charity {{operated}} by the police department in Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish.

5|$|The first {{science fiction}} magazine, Amazing Stories, {{appeared}} in 1926. By {{the end of}} the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which was gradually replaced in prominence by a new Italian nobility during {{the early part of}} the 1st century AD.

Vespasian's grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia (modern Switzerland)). By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied himself to the more prestigious patrician gens Vespasia, ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to the senatorial rank.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, {{one of the reasons why}} the princes consented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>demise</b> <b>of</b> their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E
