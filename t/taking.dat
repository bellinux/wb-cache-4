40|$|This Article {{discusses}} a niche {{within a}} niche: Federalism considerations in theories of governmental <b>takings</b> of property. Several property {{and land use}} theorists have argued that larger-scale and smaller-scale legislative bodies should be treated differently in <b>takings</b> jurisprudence, because these differently scaled legislatures are likely to behave differently in dealing with individuals 2 ̆ 7 property and to respond differently to compensation requirements. I agree with this general proposition, but I sharply disagree with the centralist drift of most of this literature, which favors the national legislature while imposing strict <b>takings</b> requirements on local legislatures. I argue that these analyses overlook the existing constraints on smaller-scale governing bodies. Meanwhile, the courts have paid very little overt attention to federalism concerns of any kind in <b>takings</b> jurisprudence, string citing cases about local, state, and national governments without differentiating them. Instead of responding to federalism (and other) <b>takings</b> theories, actual <b>takings</b> jurisprudence vacillates between leniency toward all legislatures and contempt for them. I argue, however, that federalism considerations might help courts to analyze the legislative process, and they might be incorporated into <b>takings</b> jurisprudence by a distinction between Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment <b>takings...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Supreme Court {{is finally}} {{beginning}} to bring clarity {{to the law}} of regulatory <b>takings</b> and in the process is bringing to the fore a previously submerged theme in the jurisprudence: regulatory <b>takings</b> as a question of distributional justice and horizontal equity. This Article argues that this equality dimension is fundamentally problematic. On a theoretical level, privileging norms of equality engrafts political process rationales for heightened scrutiny onto groups defined solely by the differential burden of a regulation, an exercise in circularity. Equally troubling is the inverted political economy of regulatory <b>takings</b> claims that is likely to result: the greatest judicial protection is provided to those most able to navigate the political system. And from a doctrinal perspective, an overly robust equality inquiry housed in the <b>Takings</b> Clause is inherently indeterminate, warping not only the fabric of <b>takings</b> but also of equal protection jurisprudence. Accordingly, this Article argues that concerns about the uneven distribution of regulatory burdens should sound not under the <b>Takings</b> Clause but rather under the Equal Protection Clause, with its deferential standards for the review of ordinary economic and social regulation. Excising the equality dimension of regulatory <b>takings</b> would properly leave the <b>Takings</b> Clause as a guard against those rare regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the direct exercise of eminent domain. The result would be a simpler, clearer, and ultimately more egalitarian law of <b>takings...</b>|$|R

New Zealand has banned the <b>taking</b> of manta rays since {{the introduction of}} the Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the <b>taking</b> of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen.

This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1960 case of Armstrong v. United States, the Supreme Court has {{repeatedly}} stated that “the” {{purpose of the}} <b>Takings</b> Clause is to prevent burdens falling on individual landowners that should in “justice and fairness” be born by society as a whole. The essay argues that this embodies a concept of distributional justice and further argues that the Court has failed to adequately consider the implications of such a conception {{as the basis of}} <b>Takings</b> analysis. The essay, after describing the origins of the Armstrong principle, discusses four implications: first, the rejection of a rights- based conception of the <b>Takings</b> Clause implicit in a focus on distributive justice; second, the reevaluation of current <b>Takings</b> factors in terms of distributive justice; third, the expanded philosophical literature that would be available to assess <b>Takings</b> issues; and finally, the implications of relying on unelected judges conceptions of “justice and fairness” to resolve <b>Takings</b> disputes.
