A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} entire system.

5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> reasoning.

The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
5|$|Charles Heaphy {{was born}} {{sometime}} in 1820 in London, England. He {{was the youngest}} child of Thomas Heaphy, who was a professional painter and three of his siblings also became noted painters. His grandfather John Gerrard Heaphy was a merchant from Ireland. The family lived in St John's Wood in north-west London and enjoyed a comfortable, middle-class existence although his mother died sometime during his early childhood. Thomas earned painting commissions from high society and in 1812 accompanied Arthur Wellesley, who was later to become the Duke of Wellington, as staff artist during the Peninsular War. Thomas died in 1835 and left the entire estate to his second wife, who he had married in 1833. Charles, who had obtained work as a draughtsman at the London & Birmingham Railway Company, {{moved out of the}} family home soon after. As a child, Charles was taught to paint by his father and in December 1837, sponsored by a family friend, he entered the Royal Academy school of painting. He was the only child of the Heaphy family to receive <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> education.|$|E

5|$|Eight days later, the {{division}} returned {{in preparation for}} assaulting the Hindenburg Line. The division advanced, along with the Fourth Army, pressing the retreating Germans before halting at the Hindenburg support line, {{also known as the}} Le Catelet-Nauroy Line, due to determined German resistance. On 5 October, the line was breached by {{the division}} after the Germans evacuated it for their main position (Siegfried II Stellung, otherwise known as the Masnières-Beaurevoir line) near Villers-Outréaux. The German positions lay behind dense lines of barbed wire, supported by concrete pillboxes and machine gun positions hidden in small woods providing excellent fields of fire over otherwise open countryside. Faced with <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> defence, the division was halted and spent the following days reconnoitring the German positions preparing for an assault.|$|E
5|$|For their efforts, 9 Staffel {{destroyed}} {{at least}} three hangars, hit several other buildings and destroyed eight Hurricanes on the ground. According to other sources, 10 hangars were destroyed, six damaged, the operations room put out of action, and many buildings were destroyed. It would have been worse had the bombs been released higher. A lot of bombs landed horizontally and did not explode on impact. To achieve <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> damage, KG 76 dropped nine tons of bombs. At {{the end of the}} day just one hangar was left operational at Kenley. The low-level raid put the airfield out of commission for two hours. In combat, two Hurricanes were shot down by the Dorniers' return fire. In return 9 Staffel lost four Do 17s, three slightly damaged and two seriously damaged. Low-level attacks were abandoned after The Hardest Day.|$|E

Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.|$|E

5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve <b>this</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. <b>This</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
