25|$|Throughout the Plantagenet era an English Gothic {{architecture}} flourished—the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster {{are prime}} examples. Expanding on the Norman base {{there was also}} castles, palaces, great houses, universities and parish churches. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, {{now known as the}} <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch,</b> was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance, the English Baroque style appeared, which architect Christopher Wren particularly championed. English Baroque is a casual term, sometimes used to refer to the developments in English architecture that were parallel to the evolution of Baroque architecture in continental Europe between the Great Fire of London (1666) and the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Queen Anne Style architecture flourished in England from about 1660 to about 1720, even though the Queen's reign covered only the period 1702-1714. Buildings in the Queen Anne style are strongly influenced by Dutch domestic architecture: typically, they are simple rectilinear designs in red brick, with an undemonstrative charm. Georgian architecture followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath {{is one of the best}} examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace. Since the 1930s various modernist forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.|$|E
25|$|The {{main section}} has five bays of unequal width; the first, third and fifth project {{slightly}} and have large gables. The third bay, the largest, has an entrance with a <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch</b> and double wooden doors, {{and there are}} smaller entrances in {{the fourth and fifth}} bays, again with similar doors featuring panelling and metal grilles set in moulded doorcases. Projecting forward between the fourth and fifth bays is the stone-dressed exterior of a stair-turret with a pair of Tudor-arched stained glass windows divided by a thick transom and set in a recess with a hood mould. The glass depicts knights and medieval ladies. The first (southernmost) bay rises to three storeys, of which the lower two have canted bay windows with mullions and transoms. The top storey, with its intricately decorated gable, is jettied and features painted plaster reliefs of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn with another mullioned and transomed window between them. Carved figures of the same king and queen are supported on brackets above the main entrance at first-floor level, in front of another medieval-style straight-headed window. Above this are gold lion and unicorn figures flanking carved corbels which support a three-light diamond-patterned window. On each side are smaller four-light windows of a similar pattern. A carved bressummer separates these from the half-timbered gable above. The second and fourth bays, slightly recessed, have plaster façades with applied carved timber framing and mullioned and transomed windows. The fifth bay, also plaster-clad, has two three-window ranges linked by a timber balustrade pattern and set below an elaborate gable with painted heraldic emblems, coats of arms and similar. Rising behind this gable is a stone-quoined brick tower topped with a chimney and another gable, from which two carved sheep's heads project.|$|E
500|$|College House, the {{original}} 15th-century college, is a Grade I listed building built of sandstone {{in the shape}} of a lowercase 'b' with a slate roof. It is accessed by {{the original}} gatehouse; which was constructed on a plinth and contains the original timbers. The upper storey is accessed by an external staircase. Baronial Hall, once the Great Hall, contains many of its original features, such as its timber roof, dais and canopy. There is a large fireplace dating from the 19th century, and three windows likely to date from the 16th century. The Audit Room, originally a common room, contains a panelled ceiling with decorations suggesting it was installed by the Stanley family. The upper room, originally the warden's chamber, is now the library reading room, and contains a large bay window within an elaborate <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch,</b> as well as original 17th-century doors. The west part of the building surrounding the cloister courtyard contained accommodation known as sets, for people who lived in college. There were two rooms in each set on two floors, the lower floor being used as a study. Historian Clare Hartwell, describes the cobbled courtyard which has a restored well as [...] "one of the most atmospheric spaces in the building". It is surrounded by many windows, which were probably originally unglazed. Inside there are several corridors and passages containing open beams and original stonework. To the east is the kitchen and associated rooms, and further east are rooms used for administration offices, most of which have been substantially altered.|$|E

500|$|The {{church is}} built from irregularly {{positioned}} pieces of rubble masonry, and Kennedy added red sandstone dressings in his 1882 work. The nave measures 50feet 3inches long by 17feet 3inches wide (about 15.3 by 5.3m); the chancel {{is the same}} width, and about [...] long. [...] The chapel is 17feet by 20feet 6inches (about 5.2 by 6.25m). There is medieval masonry {{in three of the}} walls: the west wall, and the lower parts of the north and south walls. The roof is made of slate, with a stone bellcote containing one bell at the west end. Inside, the wooden trusses of the roof are visible. The trusses were re-used when the roof was reconstructed. The church is entered through a porch on the south side, added in the 19th century, and a <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch</b> doorway; the porch contains a stone piscina (a water basin), said {{to be part of a}} font dating from the 12th century. [...] An old entrance in the north wall of the nave has been blocked up. [...] Two of the three windows in the north wall are from the 19th century. [...] The third, nearest to the east end, is from the early 17th century and has a square frame. The eight-sided font also dates from the 19th century. The 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also recorded the existence of an oak poor box, with iron straps, bearing the date of 1740, and a plain silver cup from about 1685.|$|E

Driving through an ancient gate-way of dun-coloured stone, spanned by the high-shouldered <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch,</b> they found {{themselves}} in a spacious court, closed by a facade on each of its three sides. The substantial portions of the existing building dated from the reign of Henry VIII.; but the picturesque and sheltered spot had been the site of an erection of a much earlier date. A licence to crenellate mansum infra manerium suum was granted by Edward II. to 'Hugo Luxellen chivaler;' but though the faint outline of the ditch and mound was visible at points, no sign of the original building remained.|$|E
60|$|A four-centred <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch</b> {{was over}} the entrance, and over the arch the signboard, now visible in the rays of an {{opposite}} lamp. Hereon the Mariners, who had been represented by the artist as persons of two dimensions only--in other words, flat as a shadow--were standing {{in a row in}} paralyzed attitudes. Being on the sunny side of the street the three comrades had suffered largely from warping, splitting, fading, and shrinkage, so that they were but a half-invisible film upon the reality of the grain, and knots, and nails, which composed the signboard. As a matter of fact, this state of things was not so much owing to Stannidge the landlord's neglect, as from the lack of a painter in Casterbridge who would undertake to reproduce the features of men so traditional.|$|E
6000|$|... § XVII. There is {{only one}} more form of arch which we have to notice. When the last {{described}} arch is used, not as the principal arrangement, but as a mere heading to a common pointed arch, we have the form c, Fig. XXXIII. Now this {{is better than the}} entirely reversed arch for two reasons; first, less of the line is weakened by reversing; secondly, the double curve has a very high æsthetic value, not existing in the mere segments of circles. For these reasons arches of this kind are not only admissible, but even of great desirableness, when their scale and masonry render them secure, but above a certain scale they are altogether barbarous; and, with the reversed <b>Tudor</b> <b>arch,</b> wantonly employed, are the characteristics of the worst and meanest schools of architecture, past or present.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{outbuildings}} {{no longer}} extant include the southern gatehouse, similar to its northern counterpart with a rusticated foundation of local sandstone, <b>Tudor</b> <b>arches,</b> overhanging eaves, gabled dormer windows and half-timber detailing.
