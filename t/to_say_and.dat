25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God told him not to fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>and</b> God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E

25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and kissed the Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then strode to {{the centre of the}} chamber without any forewarning of what he was about <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>and,</b> instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E
25|$|Pre-session Strategy {{refers to}} the leader’s ability to {{understand}} the importance of small talk just prior to group discussion. The facilitator must cordially greet the group members and begin small talk {{while at the same time}} avoid the topics and issues that will be discussed during the sessions. This will allow the group leader to observe the kind of interactions and understand which participant has what qualities. Recording is beneficial for the leader via tape recording and note taking. Note taking is useful as they can be utilized even if the tape recorder stops working. Someone other than the group leader or the facilitator should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion. Beginning of the Discussion includes the usual pattern of discussion which is welcome, overview and topic, ground rules and first question. The overview must provide an explanation of the purpose and importance of the topic of discussion. Ground rules must be stated explicitly. Some of the examples are, minimizing or eliminating side conversations, one person talks at a time, no criticizing what others have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> treating everyone’s opinion with respect and dignity. The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|On Sept 21, 1937, Hugo Black was “besieged” by reporters.

500|$|After an {{instrumental}} introduction, {{there are two}} verses, followed by a guitar solo, which {{has been described as}} [...] "richly melodic" [...] by biographer Keith Shadwick. [...] Shapiro noted the song's brevity: [...] "The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, 'Little Wing' was hardly any longer – he said what he wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> stopped".|$|E

[...] He also explained that this CD has both the catchiest and most mature songs they've ever recorded and called it a [...] "step forward." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Dance for You", Beyoncé, as {{the female}} protagonist, expresses her {{feelings}} to her man {{and tells him}} how devoted she is to him. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "about keeping things hot with her man". Echoing Vena's sentiments, Marc Hogan of Spin magazine described the lyrics as detailing a [...] "triumphantly monogamous relationship". In the first verse, Beyoncé sings about how understanding, loyal, and patient her man is. She further states that she really cares about his heart, {{she has a lot}} of valuable things <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>and</b> that for all these reasons, she is going to dance for him.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{first major}} work to appear {{after the war}} was Heartbreak House, written in 1916–17 and {{performed}} in 1920. It was produced on Broadway in November, and was coolly received; according to The Times: [...] "Mr Shaw on this occasion has more than usual <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>and</b> takes {{twice as long as}} usual to say it". After the London premiere in October 1921 The Times concurred with the American critics: [...] "As usual with Mr Shaw, the play is about an hour too long", although containing [...] "much entertainment and some profitable reflection". Ervine in The Observer thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted, except for Edith Evans as Lady Utterword.|$|E
