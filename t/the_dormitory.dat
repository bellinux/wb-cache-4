Another first-year at <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> named Kana Suoin meets Mizuho {{on the day he}} moves in, and soon after Mizuho becomes her Oneesama. Kana is more than happy to serve Mizuho any way she can, since she admires him immensely. A hyperactive ghost resides in Mizuho's room named Ichiko Takashima and is shown to speak very fast when excited. She says that Mizuho looks very much like her previous Elder love interest, who turns out to be Mizuho's deceased mother. The student council president at Seio is Takako Itsukushima who tends to have a serious personality.|$|E

5|$|The building's name {{is based}} on its {{similarity}} to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed from above. When Strawberry Panic! was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> {{was not a single}} building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of <b>the</b> <b>dormitory,</b> preumably located for security at night.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{schooling}} at {{the orphanage}} featured better equipped classrooms {{than the original}} building. A few years after operations moved in 1911, the school offered a two-year business program. By 1948 the orphanage comprised the Lisle Manual Training School for Boys and the Lisle Industrial School for Girls, {{both of which were}} managed by the Sisters of St. Benedict and run by the Archdiocese of Chicago. In the 1950s Petru Hall was built as an annex {{on the east side of}} <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> building.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|Lathrop stands five stories {{tall with}} an {{additional}} basement level. <b>The</b> <b>dormitory,</b> Elizabethan in style, is a brick building with elements of brownstone trim. The roof is a Vermont slate and from it rise five chimneys, each built with two wythes of brick and capped with bluestone.

5|$|Wulfred was {{the first}} {{archbishop}} to place his portrait on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, {{although it is not}} known whether these were support buildings, such as <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Cleeve became Crown property, it was leased to Anthony Busterd for 21years. In 1538, the {{freehold}} of {{the site}} was granted to Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. The church was demolished, save for the south wall which bounded the cloister, {{and the rest of}} the abbey converted into a mansion suitable for a gentleman. By the early seventeenth century, however, Cleeve had turned into a farm. <b>The</b> <b>dormitory</b> was now a large barn, the cloister was the farmyard {{and the rest of the}} buildings were used for agricultural purposes and a farm house. A red sandstone barn was built which abuts the south-west corner of the abbey.|$|E

5|$|Students {{moved into}} the center on May 8, 1987. The school {{remained}} unfinished, but <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> levels had been completed. Students had formerly been housed at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. In 1988, before the center's dedication, a few Jerusalem locals complained that {{the arrangement of the}} windows at night looked like a Christian cross. The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use the symbol of the cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dormitory</b> {{was known}} as North Hall upon its opening. However, by 1915, the college's , no donor had stepped forward to help fund the dormitory's {{construction}} and Vassar president Henry Noble MacCracken renamed the building Milo Jewett House after Milo P. Jewett. Jewett served as Vassar's first president from his election to the office in February 1861 until his departure from the college in spring 1864 after a dispute with the school's founder and namesake, Matthew Vassar. Although Jewett was instrumental in providing {{a vision for the}} college, the school did not open until 1865 meaning he never had the chance to oversee its student body.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the story takes place {{primarily}} at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa's parents, and <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen to live in <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} {{his enthusiasm}} for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price roughly equivalent to $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{agreed to}} take on Weinstein, who decided to redevelop his Probe {{published}} short story into a script for the animated Star Trek. Cooper addressed the script to D.C. Fontana, who had recently left the show. When it arrived at the production office, it was forwarded to Fontana unread, who sent it back to Cooper as {{she had left the}} show. The script was subsequently resubmitted by Weinstein under his agent's name for the second season of the show. Producer Lou Scheimer contacted Weinstein and informed him that they wanted to purchase the script if the ending could be modified, which Weinstein agreed to. Weinstein was 19 at the time and staying in <b>the</b> <b>dormitory</b> at the University of Connecticut, and Scheimer was surprised to find out that Weinstein was so young.|$|E
