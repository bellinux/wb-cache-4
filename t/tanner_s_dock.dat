40|$|We {{show that}} {{deviations}} from the law of one price in tradable goods are {{an important source of}} violations of absolute PPP across countries. Using highly disaggregated export data, we document systematic international price discrimination: at the U. <b>S.</b> <b>dock,</b> U. <b>S.</b> exporters ship the same good to low-income countries at lower prices. This pricing-to-market is about twice as important as any local non-traded inputs, such as distribution costs, in explaining the differences in tradable prices across countries. We propose a model of consumer search that generates pricing-to-market. In this model, consumers in low-income countries have a comparative advantage in producing non-traded, non-market search activities and therefore are more price sensitive than consumers in high-income countries. We present cross-country time use evidence and evidence from U. S. export prices that are consistent with the model...|$|R
