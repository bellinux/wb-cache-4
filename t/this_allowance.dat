5|$|In 1798, Tsar Paul I of Russia offered Louis {{the use of}} Jelgava Palace in Courland (now Latvia). Paul I also {{guaranteed}} Louis's {{safety and}} bestowed upon him a generous pension, however, the tsar later disregarded <b>this</b> <b>allowance.</b> Marie-Thérèse finally joined Louis XVIII at Jelgava in 1799. In the winter of 1798–1799, Louis XVIII wrote a biography of Marie Antoinette titled Réflexions Historiques sur Marie Antoinette. He attempted to recreate the court life of Versailles at Jelgava, where many old courtiers lived, re-establishing all the court ceremonies, including the lever and coucher (ceremonies that accompanied waking and bedding, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville {{to use a}} {{designated}} hitter (DH) in their lineups. However, <b>this</b> <b>allowance</b> was later revoked, as the Reds {{were a part of}} the National League which did not use a DH. Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let the Sounds use a DH in their lineups, they would not renew their contract and would look for a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not budge on their decision to prohibit the designated hitter, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from <b>this</b> <b>allowance.</b> The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{inspections}} {{began in}} 1907 but many poor families {{could not afford}} {{the cost of the}} doctors fees to get treated; it was not until 1912 that medical treatment was provided. However, education authorities largely ignored the provision of free medical treatment for school children. A tax allowance for children was introduced in 1909 to help families on low incomes. <b>This</b> <b>allowance</b> of £10 a year was introduced for every child below the age of 16 in the case of income tax payers whose income fell below £500 per annum (this rebate was later doubled in the 1914 budget).|$|E
25|$|The Swans' {{continued}} {{period of}} success, {{in which it}} has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a salary cap concession which the club receives; the concession {{is in the form of}} an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city. It was, however, announced in March 2014 that <b>this</b> <b>allowance</b> would be scrapped. The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000). During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade. In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA, the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for Callum Sinclair in a swap deal, as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, Michael Talia from the Western Bulldogs.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that supplementing the diet of growing lambs with urea enhances their ability to withstand gastrointestinal infection with the nematode Haemonchus contortus. This study compared lambs given two different amounts (x 1 and x 1. 5) of the same urea-supplemented diet. One dietary allowance was sufficient to allow uninfected lambs to gain approximately 400 g/week without adverse clinical signs. In contrast half of the H. contortus infected lambs on <b>this</b> dietary <b>allowance</b> had to be humanely killed {{before the end of the}} experiment due to severe anaemia and anorexia. All infected lambs on <b>this</b> dietary <b>allowance</b> showed decreased mean red cell volumes and decreased plasma albumin concentrations indicating inadequate replacement of red blood cells and plasma proteins last during the infection. The remaining lambs were offered proportionately 0. 5 more of the same dietary allowance. Among lambs an <b>this</b> dietary <b>allowance,</b> there were very few differences between uninfected and infected sheep in clinical signs and growth rate. Therefore, dietary allowances that are adequate for uninfected lambs are not necessarily sufficient for infected lambs. As nearly all grazing lambs are infected with nematodes, dietary recommendations should take parasitic infection and its nutritional demands into account...|$|R
500|$|The first {{master of}} the house was a man named Thomas Lewen, a {{merchant}} by trade. [...] The master's seal had a cross engraved on it and bore the words [...] "Sigillum Hospitalis Sancti Jesu in Novo Castro." [...] The original allowance for the inmates of the hospital was 20 shillings per 'quarterly', while the master would get 30 shillings. On 2 January 1752, the council decreed that forty 'fothers' of coal [...] be given to the hospital annually and, on 18 December 1769, the master was required to be paid £8, and each inmate sister £6 per annum. By the early 19th century <b>this</b> <b>allowance</b> had increased to £13 for each inmate per annum, four fothers of 'best Benwell' coals as well as providing clothing. In addition to this the inmates were required to see the Mayor at the Guildhall once each quarter where grievances would be heard.

2500|$|During World War II, it was {{a common}} {{practice}} of many railroad companies to issue wharfage charges on customers when transporting goods from railroad cars and onto piers, or vice versa. At {{some point during the}} war, the United States government (referred to by the Court in its decision as the [...] "Government") took over operating control of a number of piers in Norfolk, Virginia. Instead of using the railroad companies' wharfage services, the Government transferred its cargo to and from piers using its own materials. The Government, not requiring any railroad services apart from transporting the goods to and from the site, requested that it be granted an allowance for the wharfage fees, effectively asking for a refund of fees already paid before the request was made. The railroads refused to make <b>this</b> <b>allowance,</b> prompting the Government to request that the railroads then perform the services themselves, a request which the railroads also denied.|$|E
2500|$|The first American Presbyterian ministers were New England Congregationalists, whose congregations {{originated}} with {{the migration from}} England to the Dutch colony in America {{as early as the}} 1640s, and Presbyterian immigrants from Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The first American presbytery, uniting some of these independent congregations and those of the British immigrants, was formed in 1706. This body grew large enough to form the first synod in Philadelphia in 1716. Prior to 1729, some presbyteries required candidates for the ministry to profess adherence to the Westminster Confession. When the Synod of Philadelphia met in 1729 to adopt the Westminster Confession as the doctrinal standard, it required all ministers to declare their approval of the Westminster Confession of Faith and catechisms. At the same time, the Adopting Act allowed candidates and ministers to scruple articles within the Confession. Whether or not the article scrupled was essential or nonessential was judged by the presbytery with jurisdiction over the candidate's examination. <b>This</b> <b>allowance</b> implied a difference, within the standards themselves, between things that are essential and necessary to the Christian faith, and things that are not. This compromise left a permanent legacy to following generations of Presbyterians in America, to decide what is meant by [...] "essential and necessary", resulting in permanent controversies over the manner in which a minister is bound to accept the document; and it has left the American versions of the Westminster Confession more amenable to the will of the church to amend it.|$|E
