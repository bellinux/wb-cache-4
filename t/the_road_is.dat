5|$|The road, {{as well as}} {{all other}} state roads in Croatia, is managed and {{maintained}} by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company. The road carries an annual average daily traffic of about 2,000 vehicles, and the traffic volume increases by up to 1,000 vehicles in summer as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> used by tourists in the region. The southernmost portion of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> significantly more congested as it carries Pula suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|Aylmer Road is a {{very short}} stretch of road, running west for {{less than half a}} mile between the {{junction}} with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet. The entire southern side of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> taken up by Highgate Golf Course, while the northern side is a mixture of small shops, flats and allotments. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, VC KCB, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> gazetted a State Highway in 1961. In {{the same}} year tar-sealing of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|Lonsdale <b>Road</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> Earl of Lonsdale. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> named in 1905 {{although}} the first houses in <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>were</b> erected from 1902.|$|R
50|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> only paved from Muar to Lenga {{and another}} section near Labis; however, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> fully paved in the 1970s {{as a result}} of the opening of many FELDA {{settlements}} along Labis-Lenga stretch. During Malayan Emergency (1948-1960), <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> sabotaged by communist terrorist.|$|R
5|$|Beyond Oxford Circus, {{it meets}} Great Portland Street, Wardour Street and Rathbone Place and ends at St Giles Circus, the {{junction}} with Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road, next to Tottenham Court Road station. The eastward continuation is New Oxford Street, and then Holborn. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> entirely within the City of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and slippery conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> the most often closed in the province.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, 15,240 {{vehicles}} {{traveled the}} road between Tam Kong Shan Road interchange and Tsing Tsuen Road. It {{is measured in}} average annual daily traffic (AADT), which measures the amount of traffic daily on average. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> classified as a District Distributor by the Transport Department.|$|E
50|$|A {{portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> opened to traffic in 1970 and <b>the</b> entire <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> originally built by Japan Highway Public Corporation and management {{was transferred to}} Aichi Prefectural Road Public Corporation in 1983.|$|R
50|$|After 1974, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} by about 14 km before reaching Danac, the farthest barangay. <b>The</b> present-day <b>road</b> <b>is</b> now {{as far as}} the Poblacion; however, the rest of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has <b>been</b> abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Beaufort Street {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1848. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> macadamised in 1870. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} built to service the Mount Lawley area in the early 19th century.|$|R
5|$|PA 21 travels east-southeast {{through the}} rest of rural Greene County. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> mostly level and the {{countryside}} is mostly farmland. In Paisley, PA 21 intersects Pennsylvania Route 88, then becomes a four-lane divided highway until it crosses the Masontown Bridge over the Monongahela River.|$|E
5|$|Pentonville Road is a road in Central London {{that runs}} {{west to east}} from Kings Cross to City Road at The Angel, Islington. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> part of the London Inner Ring Road {{and part of the}} {{boundary}} of the London congestion charge zone.|$|E
5|$|Portions of the {{original}} Route 280 are still navigable, but in poor condition; <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> currently in use as a service road for a private campground.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{incorporated}} on <b>the</b> {{same day}} as the Syracuse Stone Railroad which was organized for the same purpose. Both <b>roads</b> <b>were</b> consolidated before <b>the</b> construction of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> complete on October 16, 1838.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> State <b>Road</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in June 1993 when the Mid-Bay Bridge was opened. Originally, the northern terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> toll plaza {{at the northern}} end of the bridge. The northern approached was accessed via White Point <b>Road.</b> In 2011, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> opened to SR 20.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the homes}} in <b>the</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} {{planned to be}} affordable for Miamians, homes in <b>the</b> <b>Roads</b> <b>were</b> popular early on and quickly became one of Miami's most prestigious neighborhoods.|$|R
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike {{has only}} two lanes for the {{majority}} of its length; however, there is a short eastbound passing lane. The Chickasaw is the only two-lane turnpike in Oklahoma. Lightly traveled, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> used by about 2,000vehicles per day.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) {{restricts the}} use of Highway 82 through the pass. Most {{significant}} is the winter closure. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> typically closed after the first significant winter snowfall, or by November 7 at the latest (but there have been exceptions.). CDOT tries to reopen just before Memorial Day weekend in late May, the traditional beginning of summer in the United States, when enough of the accumulated snowpack has melted {{to make it possible}} to clear and repair the road. Some years, after light winters, the pass has reopened as early as May 12. Two gates, just east of Aspen on the west end and west of the remaining buildings of the stage stop of Everett on the east, prevent motor vehicles from passage. When <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> closed, Aspen is isolated from the east and Highway 82 up the valley from Glenwood Springs becomes the only vehicular access to the city during its busy ski season.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} currently {{does not}} have a route marker. There is a duplex along the highway where it additionally carries the B72 route marker between the two sections of the Snowy Mountains Highway. Within the ACT, a section of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> also part of Tourist Drive 5.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{designated as}} part of US 80. After 1975, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> designated Texas State Highway Loop 519, although it was signed as a business route of US 80.|$|R
50|$|Only <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from {{province}} centre to {{the district}} centre has been asphalted and inside the district all <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> in bad condition. 40% of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>are</b> open to traffic in all seasons of the year.|$|R
50|$|The route was {{established}} in the 1920s, when it connected U.S. Highway 87, now Interstate 25, to Sedalia. By 1963, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> deleted from Palmer Lake to Interstate 25 and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> paved to its entirety. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> extended to replace SH 50 (now deleted) due to confusion with U.S. Highway 50. A section from SH 83 to I-25 was deleted in October 2007.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> within the Borough of Colchester {{aside from a}} small portion at the northern end, {{which is in the}} Borough of Tendring. The main bus routes from Colchester to Ipswich, 93 and 94, run along the road. It also serves a portion of the Colchester half marathon route.|$|E
5|$|The {{route and}} {{surroundings}} of former Highway36 have largely remained unaltered since the highway was decommissioned in 1998. Within the City of Kawartha Lakes, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{now known as}} Kawartha Lakes Road36, while within the County of Peterborough, it is known as Peterborough County Road36.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> one-way northbound {{and part of}} the A4, a major road through West London. From Piccadilly Circus northwards, it is numbered A4201, though in common with roads inside the London congestion charging zone, the number does not appear on signs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} Francis Fleming, Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong between 1890 and 1892. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> built on <b>the</b> 1921 {{reclamation}}. In the 1970s, another reclamation extended <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to Wan Chai North by the Victoria Harbour.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{designated as}} part of US 80 (US 80). After 1965, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> designated Texas State Highway Loop 416, although it was signed as a business route of US 80.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} designated in 1942 between Grandfalls and Imperial and {{has been}} incrementally lengthened over the years incorporating a former route of FM 847 before <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1975. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> crosses U.S. Route 67 and U.S. Route 385 in Girvin.|$|R
5|$|The valley narrows into {{a canyon}} {{as the road}} begins to climb again, closely hugging the north wall. Four miles (6.4km) east of the city, just past Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> closed in wintertime. Past this point {{development}} along the road abates {{as most of the}} land alongside <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> part of White River National Forest. On {{the north side of the}} road are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.|$|E
5|$|The western {{section of}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} A4 one-way system between Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square. No buses run along {{the full length of}} Coventry Street but there is access to {{numerous}} routes from Piccadilly Circus or nearby Charing Cross Road.|$|E
5|$|Whitechapel Road {{is a major}} {{arterial}} road in Whitechapel, Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is named after a small chapel of ease dedicated to St Mary and connects Aldgate to the west (as Whitechapel High Street) with Mile End Road to the east. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>is</b> part of the historic Roman road from London to Colchester, now the A11.|$|E
50|$|Originally an unpaved track, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated at <b>the</b> {{behest of}} Wilhelm II (after {{whom it is}} named), and opened to traffic in 1906. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt in 1939 {{as part of the}} East-West Axis of the planned Welthauptstadt Germania, and much of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> as it <b>is</b> today dates from this time.|$|R
50|$|Twenty {{years later}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{improved}} upon, and diverted in spots to become <b>the</b> Kingston <b>Road.</b> <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> later officially named <b>The</b> Dundas <b>Road</b> (also Kingston Road) after a prominent British colonial official. Danforth's <b>Road</b> diverges from <b>the</b> later Kingston <b>Road</b> (York Road) at Trenton.|$|R
50|$|The first {{stretch of}} <b>road</b> <b>was</b> opened in October 1897 {{up to the}} pass. At first, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> {{shielded}} from <b>the</b> danger of avalanche by protective covers, but eventually a tunnel was built, and then a bridge over <b>the</b> Hölltobel. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> only 3 meters wide. In 1909 <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>was</b> finished into <b>the</b> Lech Valley in Tyrol. Since 1936 the pass has been open in winter. Since 1948, funds from the Marshall Plan have been utilized to improve <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and make it safer from avalanches.|$|R
