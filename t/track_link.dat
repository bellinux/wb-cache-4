50|$|As with cars, {{wheel travel}} and spring rate affect the {{bumpiness}} {{of the ride}} and {{the speed at which}} rough terrain can be negotiated. It may be significant that a smooth ride, which is often associated with comfort, increases the accuracy when firing on the move (analogously to battle ships with reduced stability, due to reduced metacentric height). It also reduces shock on optics and other equipment. The unsprung weight and <b>track</b> <b>link</b> weight may limit speed on roads and affect the life of the track and other components.|$|E

5000|$|Fresh {{plans have}} been {{proposed}} following announcements that a new high-speed line, High Speed Two (HS2), is to be constructed between London and Manchester and Leeds via Birmingham. The proposed route of HS2 into London will bring the line {{very close to the}} existing High Speed 1 (HS1) line which terminates at St Pancras station; at their closest points, the two high-speed lines will be only 0.4 mi apart, and the Department for Transport (DfT) examined various proposals for connecting HS1 and HS2. A governmental [...] "command paper" [...] published in March 2010 proposed either a rapid transit link between HS1 and HS2 terminals, or a direct railway connection. Later announcements on 10 January 2012 confirmed that {{the first phase of the}} HS2 project was to include the construction of a single <b>track</b> <b>link</b> across North London between HS2 and HS1, partially in tunnels and partially over the existing North London Line, allowing for three trains per hour in both directions. DfT proposals in 2013 stated that this link would allow HS2 trains from the North of England to bypass London Euston and connect straight to HS1, enabling direct rail services to be run from Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham to Paris, Brussels and other continental European destinations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of evolutionary link strength mining for information diffusion modeling and predicting. Most exiting approaches analyzing link strength focus on either topological information or content semantics, but do not simultaneously consider combining both features. Furthermore, in many applications of text stream data, the users are always in need {{of the ability to}} <b>track</b> <b>link</b> strength evolution pattern along time line. In this paper, we argue that the evolutionary link strength reflects a user’s interest to create reply links and is influenced by both neighbors and topic content. With this aim in mind, we propose a novel Content-Topology-Time model for link strength predicting in time-aware online social network. Comprehensive experimental studies on real world micro-blog data set show that our approach outperforms existing ones and well matches the practice...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the 3 D kinematic {{analysis of the}} <b>Track</b> <b>Link</b> Mechanism for Trailing Edge Flaps of a Light Transport Aircraft (LTA). This complex mechanism comprises of 22 components and 9 joints that were modeled and assembled using CATIA software. The kinematic analysis of the mechanism was carried out using CATlA V 4 Kinematics module, based on the initial layout proposed by the Wing Design Group in conjunction with Aerodynamics Group. The primary objective of this analysis was to minimize the lateral drift (l 1. 37 mm) in the roller movement as the roller moves in the track resulting a flap deflection of 0 - 30 °. This necessitated changes in the geometry of the tracks (existing tracks are made of combination of a straight line and a curve) through which the roller moves. The paper puts forward in detail the existing mechanism and the new proposal with the modifications to the existing mechanism, carried out progressively to achieve the desired objectives and also {{presents the}} results thereof...|$|E
40|$|This {{project has}} been {{sponsored}} by QinetiQ Limited (QinetiQ); whose aim it is to model the dynamics of a prototype high-speed military tracked vehicle. Specifically their objective is to describe the mechanism by which force inputs are transmitted from the ground to the vehicle’s hull. Many track running gear components are steel and can be modelled as simple lumped masses or as linear springs without internal damping. These present no difficulty to the modeller. However tracked vehicle running gear also has nonlinear components that require more detailed descriptions. Models for two rubber components, the road wheel tyre and <b>track</b> <b>link</b> bush, and {{a model for the}} suspensions rotary damper, are developed here. These three components all have highly nonlinear dynamic responses. Rubber component nonlinearities are caused by the materials nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. Stiffness is amplitude dependent and the material exhibits a significant amount of internal damping, which is predominantly Coulombic in nature but also relaxes overtime. In this work, a novel method for measuring the elastic and viscoelastic response of Carbon Black Filled Natural Rubber components has been devised and a ‘general purpose’ mathematical model developed that describes the materials response and is suited to use in multibody dynamic analysis software. The vehicle’s suspension rotary damper model describes three viscous flow regimes (laminar, turbulent and pressure relief), as a continuous curved response that relates angular velocity to damping torque. Hysteresis due to the compression of entrapped gas, compliance of the dampers structure and compression of damper oil is described by a single non-parametric equation. Friction is considered negligible and is omitted from the model. All components are modelled using MSC. ADAMS TM multibody dynamic analysis software. The models are shown to be easily implemented and computationally robust. QinetiQ’s requirement for ‘practical’ track running gear component models has been met.

40|$|Abstract: In this investigation, a {{computational}} {{finite element}} procedure for the deformation and stress {{analysis of the}} chain <b>links</b> of <b>tracked</b> vehicles is presented and {{used to examine the}} validity of using the static approach in the design and stress analysis of tracked vehicles. The contact forces resulting from the interaction between the <b>track</b> <b>links</b> and the vehicle components (sprocket, idler, and the rollers) as well as the interaction between the <b>track</b> <b>links</b> and the ground are evaluated using continuous force models, which are used to define generalized contact forces associated with the deformation degrees of freedom of the <b>track</b> <b>links</b> using the virtual work. The dynamic forces including the contact forces used in the finite element procedure developed in this investigation are evaluated using a 54 -body vehicle model in which the track is modeled as a closed kinematic chain with 42 degrees of freedom. It is demonstrated in this study that the effect of the contact forces is more significant as compared to the effect of the rigid-body inertia forces of the chain links, and consequently, it is assumed that the deformation of the <b>track</b> <b>links</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} the overall motion of the vehicle. In the finite element computational procedure used in this study, three-dimensional solid elements are used to discretize the <b>links</b> of the <b>track</b> chain. The numerical results presented in this investigation demonstrate that the use of the static analysis may lead to low estimates of the stresses of the <b>track</b> <b>links</b> as compared to those obtained by a dynamic stress analysis that takes into consideration the time history of the forces...|$|R
