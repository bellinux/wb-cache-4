5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons.

5|$|After the English cricket team's tour of Australia in 1932–33, {{known for}} the Bodyline bowling tactics used by the English team, {{relations}} between the Australian Board of Control and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were strained. In the English winter of 1935–36, the MCC sent a team to tour Australia and New Zealand, {{in an attempt to}} regain some good will in Australia. Holmes captained the side, which was predominantly composed of younger players the MCC wanted to gain experience. Mitchell-Innes was included in the touring party, and played in ten first-class matches, including <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> contests against the New Zealand national cricket team. He scored four first-class half-centuries, achieving his highest score of the tour against Otago, when he contributed 87 runs to the MCC's total of 550.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} armistice, Enns was crewed by sailors of the KSCS in 1918–19. Under {{the terms of}} the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye {{concluded}} in September 1919, Enns was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, and was officially handed over to the KSCS navy and renamed Drava in 1920. Her sister ship Inn was transferred to Romania and renamed Besarabia. In 1925–26, Drava was refitted, but by the following year only <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets.|$|E

5|$|The {{installation}} {{was noted}} as lengthy by PC Magazine, especially on malware-infected systems. Spyware detection has been tweaked {{since the last}} release. It has been updated to better identify keyloggers. In PC Magazine testing, Norton successfully detected all 11 spyware threats and removed all but two. PC Magazine did give Norton credit even when manual removal was required. The suite also removed three of four commercial keyloggers. When attempting to install the spyware on a clean system, Norton blocked all 11 and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> commercial keyloggers. In most cases, it did not block the installation, however Norton did call for a scan after the spyware was installed. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 78 percent of spyware, removed 82 percent, and blocked 65 percent from installing.|$|E

5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the approach of the German strike force and were successful in sinking <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, it should not be considered surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E
5|$|While the {{superstructure}} and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> main gun turrets were removed, the barbette {{of one of}} the turrets remains visible {{above the}} water.

The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor its role as a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.|$|E
