His book was quoted in a 1979 church manual: [...] "the glorious <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that [...] is curable .... Certainly it can be overcome .... How can you say the door cannot be opened until your knuckles are bloody, till your head is bruised, till your muscles are sore?" [...] Kimball viewed many homosexuals as [...] "basically good people who have become trapped in sin" [...] and that [...] "some totally conquer homosexuality in a few months." [...] However, {{he also says that}} homosexual behavior can lead to sex with animals.|$|E

6000|$|As Wordsworth's work is {{too often}} marred by the moralizer, and Byron's by the demagogue, and Shelley's by the reformer, so Keats's work suffers by the {{opposite}} extreme of aloofness from every human interest; so much so, that he is often accused of being indifferent to humanity. His work is also criticised as being too effeminate for ordinary readers. Three things should be remembered in this connection. First, that Keats sought to express beauty for its own sake; that beauty is as essential to normal humanity as is government or law; and that the higher man climbs in civilization the more imperative becomes his need of beauty {{as a reward for}} his labors. Second, that Keats's letters are as much an indication of the man as is his poetry; and in his letters, with their human sympathy, their eager interest in social problems, their humor, and their keen insight into life, there is no trace of effeminacy, but rather every indication of a strong and noble manhood. The third <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that all Keats's work was done in three or four years, with small preparation, and that, dying at twenty-five, he left us a body of poetry which will always be one of our most cherished possessions. He is often compared with [...] "the marvelous boy" [...] Chatterton, whom he greatly admired, and to whose memory he dedicated his Endymion; but though both died young, Chatterton was but a child, while Keats was in all respects a man. It is idle to prophesy what he might have done, had he been granted a Tennyson's long life and scholarly training. At twenty five his work was as mature as was Tennyson's at fifty, though the maturity suggests the too rapid growth of a tropical plant which under the warm rains and the flood of sunlight leaps into life, grows, blooms in a day, and dies.|$|E
5000|$|A crucial <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> {{that while}} many {{passages}} of the Etude will be tempting to play forte, excessive loud playing will leave little room to play very {{strongly in the}} climaxes of the piece. Sometimes a soft, fast, and whispering sound will create more tension and energy than a fast and loud build-up.|$|E

40|$|However, {{as there}} are many {{versions}} of Harvard referencing this guide has been produced to demonstrate the referencing system that the SSES uses across all undergraduate and MSc programmes. This is the referencing style that you should adopt for ALL your work. Why do I need to reference? There are several reasons why you need to reference your work. 1. References are used to demonstrate the depth and breadth of your reading {{and you can use}} references to support your analysis and argument. Using referencing in your work is therefore a way in which you can enhance your grade. 2. Referencing is the way that you acknowledge other people’s work within your own coursework. If you do not use referencing or use it incorrectly it could potentially be viewed as plagiarism (copying someone’s work without acknowledgement). There can also be copyright issues associated with using other people’s work without acknowledgement. 3. Referencing allows other people to identify the source of the information that you have used. Referencing is not difficult as it is all about following the instructions. The most important <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> be organised and be consistent. You should use referencing within any piece of your work where you are using sources of information that are not your own. This includes essays, case studies, presentations, leaflets and written exams. All sources of information that you use should be included within your work in two places: 1. In the text- this is called a citation. 2. At the end in the references list...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{treatise}} on the Topics, Aristotle does not explicitly define a topos, {{though it is}} [...] "at least primarily a strategy for argument not infrequently justified or explained by a principle." [...] He characterises it in the Rhetoric thus: [...] "I call the same thing element and topos; for an element or a topos is a heading under which many enthymemes fall." [...] By element, he means a general form under which enthymemes of the same type can be included. Thus, the topos is a general argument source, from which the individual arguments are instances, and {{is a sort of}} template from which many individual arguments can be constructed. The word [...] (tópos, literally [...] "place, location") is also related to the ancient memory method of [...] "loci", by which <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>are</b> recollected by mentally connecting them with successive real or imagined places.|$|R
40|$|In today’s world nothing local is just local anymore, writes Roshni Hegerman, {{strategic}} planning director of McCann Sydney. Globalization has gifted {{lot to the}} consumers. Consumers in India are now becoming more informed, sophisticated and demanding. India {{is one of the}} youngest countries in the world, and the attitudes of the Indian consumers are changing at a rapid pace. A glocal strategy standardizes certain core elements and localizes other elements. It is a compromise between global and domestic marketing strategies. Glocal marketing reflects both the ideal of pure global marketing strategy and the recognition that locally related issues of marketing activities need to be considered. One of the most important <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that getting localisation right doesn’t have to involve a big change to have a big effect. The impact achieved by simply taking the time to consider local sensitivities and adapting your brand appropriately can be huge. The rise of a global culture doesn’t mean that consumers share the same tastes or values. Rather, people in different nations, often with conflicting viewpoints, participate in a shared conversation, drawing upon shared symbols. Spending the time and money to localise the marketing activity is the priority for any organisation. If not, one must take the risk of losing the money spent on global campaign – and to repair the lost image. It <b>is</b> however, important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that localisation can go wrong...|$|R

50|$|One {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} monster's original spot {{needs to stay}} covered {{to send it to}} a hole. If Lolo removes a monster that was sent to a hole and its original starting point was uncovered, it would not continue going to the hole, but rather back to its original starting point. Though in some rooms, monsters may need to be sent back to their original starting point in order to solve the room.|$|E
50|$|Arabic art {{takes on}} many forms, {{though it is}} jewelry, {{textiles}} and architecture that are the most well-known. It is generally split up by different eras, among them being early Arabic, early medieval, late medieval, late Arabic, and finally, current Arabic. One <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that many times a particular style from one era may continue into the next with few changes, while some have a drastic transformation. This {{may seem like a}} strange grouping of art mediums, but they are all closely related.|$|E

6000|$|But the {{principal}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is,</b> that the constant design of both these orators {{in all their}} speeches, was to drive some one particular point, either the condemnation or acquittal of an accused person, a persuasive to war, the enforcing of a law, and the like; which was determined upon the spot, according as the orators on either side prevailed. And here it was often found of absolute necessity to inflame or cool the passions of the audience, especially at Rome where Tully spoke, and with whose writings young divines (I mean those among them who read old authors) are more conversant than with those of Demosthenes, who by many degrees excelled the other at least as an orator. But I do not see how this talent of moving the passions can be of any great use toward directing Christian men {{in the conduct of}} their lives, at least in these northern climates, where I am confident the strongest eloquence of that kind will leave few impressions upon any of our spirits deep enough to last till the next morning, or rather to the next meal.[4] ...|$|R

5000|$|So that {{democracy}} can be revived, and sustained, throughout the world, the U.S. and other developed countries must play their part. The U.S. should only give {{financial aid to}} countries that are using the money to further develop their governance. [...] This selectivity is defined in the Millennium Challenge Account (part of Bush’s foreign policy). Under this policy, it says a country will receive aid dependent on “whether they rule justly, whether they invest in basic health care and education, and whether they promote economic freedom.” The important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> promoting democracy will take time and effort.|$|E
50|$|When multiplying, {{a useful}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that the factors of the operands still remain. For example, {{to say that}} 14 &times; 15 was 211 would be unreasonable. Since 15 is a {{multiple}} of 5, the product should be as well. Likewise, 14 is a multiple of 2, so the product should be even. Furthermore, any number which is a multiple of both 5 and 2 is necessarily a multiple of 10, and in the decimal system would end with a 0. The correct answer is 210. It is a multiple of 10, 7 (the other prime factor of 14) and 3 (the other prime factor of 15).|$|E

60|$|I had {{not been}} at Sanstead House two days before doubts began to creep in on this point. What the boy, observing the assistant-master {{standing}} about in apparently magnificent idleness, does not realize is that the unfortunate is really putting in a spell of exceedingly hard work. He is 'taking duty'. And 'taking duty' <b>is</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> especially by a man who, like myself, has lived a life of fatted ease, protected from all the minor annoyances of life by a substantial income.|$|R
5000|$|... “The first <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> now <b>is</b> {{that no one}} of us dare misbehave because we’re angry sic. We have {{to behave}} like strong and {{determined}} people, determined to face all the perils that surround us, determined {{to carry out the}} mandate that our great teacher and our great leader had given us, remembering always that if, as I believe, his spirit looks upon us and sees you, nothing would displease his soul so much as to see that we have indulged in any small behavior or any violence.So we must not do that. But {{that does not mean that}} we should be weak, but rather that we should in strength and in unity face all the troubles and difficulties and conflicts must be ended in the face of this great disaster. A great disaster is a symbol <b>to</b> us <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> all the big things of life and forget the small things, of which we have thought too much.” ...|$|R

The time-traveling that has {{occurred}} is already part of the timeline that produces Warhawk as are the edicts to that timeline, including those we haven't yet seen on the show. The important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that Warhawk isn't even 30 in Batman Beyond years ... a few {{things are going to}} occur in that time period to change the current status quo. Also, it's dramatically more interesting for Green Lantern to believe it's the actual future. If he believes it's only one possibility it doesn't carry any more weight than a particularly vivid dream." ...|$|E
5000|$|English-speaking Igbo {{frequently}} use {{the titles}} of English royalty ("His Royal Highness") to refer to their indigenous rulers .... The main <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that kings partake of the divinities in this region and are important ritual practitioners; any Igwe is also {{the head of the}} royal cult - and his ancestors are invoked on behalf of the entire town. Most northern Igbo kingships are not hereditary in a simple sense, however. There are kingly clans whose male members are eligible for kingship, and then there are kingmaker clans, whose elders have the task of [...] "discovering" [...] the new king during the interregnum. This is a process that is part-divination - and ofos might well be involved - and part hard-nosed indigenous politics (30 Nov. 2002).|$|E
50|$|When {{we refer}} to the {{historical}} term 'violone', we must include almost all the instruments of both the violin and viol families (plus some hybrid instruments) that functioned as either tenor or bass members of those families. As the name 'violone' really means (see below), truly, these are all large string instruments. It {{was not until the}} 20th century that players and scholars started to realize that there were so many types of violoni and that not all of them functioned or sounded like double basses. Because of this, the classification of violoni according to tuning, family and function makes it start to be possible to clarify composers' intentions at different times and places. The most important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> that different types of violoni sound (and often function) quite differently from each other.|$|E
6000|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> that Diderot, like Vauvenargues, Voltaire, Condorcet, {{always had}} Pascal {{in his mind}} when dealing with apologetics. They all {{recognised}} in him a thinker with a love of truth, as distinguished from the mere priest, Catholic, Anglican, Brahman, or another. [...] "Pascal," [...] says Diderot, [...] "was upright, but he was timid and inclined to credulity. An elegant writer and a profound reasoner, he would doubtless have enlightened the world, if Providence had not abandoned him to people who sacrificed his talents to their own antipathies. How much to be regretted, {{that he did not}} leave to the theologians of his time the task of settling their own differences; that he did not give himself up to the search for truth, without reserve and without the fear of offending God by using all the intelligence that God had given him. How much to be regretted that he took for masters men who were not worthy to be his disciples, and was foolish enough to think Arnauld, De Sacy, and Nicole, better men than himself." [...] (§ 14.) The Philosophic Thoughts are designed for an answer in form to the more famous Thoughts of this champion of popular theology. The first of the following extracts, for instance, recalls a memorable illustration of Pascal's sublime pessimism. A few passages will illustrate sufficiently the line of argument which led the foremost men {{at the opening of the}} philosophic revolution to reject the pretensions of Christianity:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Regular plying {{consists}} of taking 2 or more singles and twisting them together, the opposite way. This {{can be done}} on either a spinning wheel or a spindle. The most important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> though <b>is</b> that the twist must go the opposite direction. If in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (which is called a [...] "Z" [...] twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross diagonally {{in the same direction}} as the diagonal of a [...] "Z"), in order to ply it the wheel must spin counter-clockwise (an [...] "S" [...] twist). This is because otherwise you are not balancing the twist, just twisting it more. The concept is similar to when a heavily twisted piece of yarn is folded, and it twists up on itself. It is most common for singles to be spun with a [...] "Z" [...] twist, and then plied with an [...] "S" [...] twist.|$|R
60|$|In all {{garrison}} towns, guard-calls and réveilles, {{and such}} like, make a fine romantic interlude in civic business. Bugles, and drums, and fifes are of themselves most excellent things in nature; {{and when they}} carry the mind to marching armies, and the picturesque vicissitudes of war, they stir up something proud in the heart. But in {{a shadow of a}} town like Landrecies, with little else moving, these points of war made a proportionate commotion. Indeed, they <b>were</b> the only <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> It <b>was</b> just the place to hear the round going by at night in the darkness, with the solid tramp of men marching, and the startling reverberations of the drum. It reminded you that even this place was a point in the great warfaring system of Europe, and might on some future day be ringed about with cannon smoke and thunder, and make itself a name among strong towns.|$|R
