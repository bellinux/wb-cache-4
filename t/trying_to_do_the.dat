25|$|Both Gold and Belle set off {{to search}} for Gideon's heart. Henry helps Emma escape from Gideon (knocking him out with a fire extinguisher) with Emma placing a {{protection}} spell to contain him temporarily. The others realize that Fiona has crafted the perfect trap: If Gideon kills Emma, Light will be destroyed. And if Emma kills Gideon, she will turn dark and Light will still be destroyed. Regina consoles Emma and encourages her to find another way like she always does. Emma attempts to hold off Gideon as Gold finds Gideon's heart. When Gold finds Gideon's heart he is tempted by {{a manifestation of the}} Darkness, which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart, Rumplestiltskin. The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he can finally have it all: power and love. The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him, that if Emma dies his Dark Magic will increase exponentially. After it's all over he can spend 100 years exploring the world with Belle, and spend the next 200 years destroying it. Gold resists and chooses {{to do the right thing}} and tries to use Gideon's heart to stop him from killing Emma. However Fiona's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon and instead Gideon's heart stops beating and dims. The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing and Gold heads out to Belle who consoles him for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing. Back at the intersection, Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves, protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost. Realizing what she must do, Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her releasing an enormous blast of light magic, ending the Final Battle.|$|E
25|$|The Master's {{past with}} the Doctor is {{explored}} somewhat in The Dark Path, which reveals {{that his name}} prior to taking the alias of the Master is Koschei, when he encounters the Second Doctor during their travels. Although initially a somewhat anti-heroic version of the Doctor, willing to commit murder as a first option to save the day but generally still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right, Koschei turns to evil and becomes the Master after he discovers that his companion and lover, Ailla, is an undercover agent of the Celestial Intervention Agency sent to spy on him. During {{the course of the}} novel, Ailla is shot and killed, with Koschei, not knowing that she is a Time Lord and will simply regenerate, completing a time-based weapon to benefit the anti-alien efforts of soldiers from Earth's Empire, in an attempt to bring her back. The weapon is used to destroy the planet Teriliptus and its inhabitants, but when Ailla turns up alive, the knowledge that he has destroyed a planet for nothing, coupled with the revelation of Ailla's betrayal, proves too much. Koschei resolves to bring his own order to the universe at the expense of free will and becoming its Master. Thanks to the Doctor reprogramming his weapon, Koschei is trapped in a black hole {{at the end of the}} novel, with it being left uncertain how he will escape. Although it is generally implied that it takes him most of his remaining lives to do so (hence why the Master is on his last life while the Doctor, intended to be his contemporary, is only on his third), the cover art of The Dark Path depicts Koschei as being already the same regeneration as the Delgado-era Master.|$|E

500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Brynden [...] "Blackfish" [...] Tully in the series, {{spoke about}} his character's {{encounter}} with Brienne of Tarth, {{in an interview}} with IGN, noting [...] "Brienne represented for him his young self, a person of integrity, a soldier of integrity, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing.

[...] He continued by saying about their relationship to each other, [...] "She spoke very clearly to power. She was talking to an older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where he acknowledges that to her face.

It's really one big story. We're approaching it like a mini-feature. It'll have a singular narrative drive."

The episodes first aired in the United States on May 13 and May 20, 2010. The writers, finding the script to be easily divisible, ended the first episode with William Bell and Olivia meeting outside Fauxlivia's apartment, and began the second with Bell helping Walter escape from the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rich from Entertainment Weekly {{had mixed}} {{views on the}} {{prospect}} of Michael returning in season four, because although Perrineau {{was one of his}} [...] "favorite" [...] actors, he liked how peaceful the series had become without Michael constantly screaming [...] "Walt!". IGN's Chris Carabott called Michael's return [...] "the worst kept secret in Lost history", but still found his reveal [...] "exciting". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "a fine performance from Mr. Perrineau" [...] in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle to deal with the guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] Cynthia Littleton of Variety was [...] "really happy" [...] to see Michael again, and wrote [...] "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing, most of the time." [...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones commented that [...] " [...] suicidal plight was well conveyed and there were plenty of shocks and thrills along the way". Before the fourth season finale aired, Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen ranked Michael being unable to commit suicide as the thirteenth best moment of the season, but did add [...] "This story line didn't match the hype". Oscar Dahl from BuddyTV called Michael's death [...] "the culmination of a fairly lackluster story arc".|$|E

Sepinwall wrote that Michael's [...] "struggle {{to deal with the}} guilt from his Faustian bargain to save Walt was another moving example of how the writers this season are really trying to build on the emotional impact of everything that's happened before." [...] The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman echoed this praise and referred to [...] "Gay Tom" [...] as [...] "a unique and funny twist". Cynthia Littleton of Variety wrote that [...] "Perrineau plays it just right most of the time—no hysterics or scenery-chewing, just a man <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing, most of the time."

Dan Compora of SyFy Portal enjoyed seeing dead characters in flashbacks and commended Perrineau's performance and character's story, while criticizing the underutilization {{of the rest of the}} main cast. In an overall positive review for the episode, The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter had mixed feelings for the revelation of Tom's sexual orientation, writing that [...] "It seemed a little oddly placed, kind of like 'Let's make one of our characters gay just for the heck of it' but still it's cool that the show has a perfectly normal … not over-the-top gay character." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". He said in his review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied because kids were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E
