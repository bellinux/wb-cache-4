5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of <b>tin</b> <b>oxides,</b> one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E
500|$|John Dalton {{studied and}} {{expanded}} upon this previous work and developed {{the law of}} multiple proportions: if two elements can be combined to form {{a number of possible}} compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. [...] For example: Proust had studied <b>tin</b> <b>oxides</b> and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these were tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively).
