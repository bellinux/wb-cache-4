5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on their race, including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. <b>The</b> <b>Peabody</b> was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peabody</b> Orchestra, {{formed in}} 1866, {{was the first}} {{professional}} orchestra in Baltimore. The Orchestra premiered many works in its early years, including some by Asger Hamerik, a prominent Danish composer who became director of the Orchestra. Ross Jungnickel founded the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra before 1890, when the Orchestra first performed, and <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Orchestra ceased to exist. Jungnickel's orchestra, however, lasted only until 1899.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in July 1895, Seibal was {{explored}} by Teoberto Maler {{on behalf of}} <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Museum of Harvard University. He made a site plan and discovered a new stela to add to those already discovered. He returned to the site for further investigations in August 1905 but discovered no new monuments. <b>The</b> <b>Peabody</b> Museum published Maler's work in 1908, including good quality photos of the stelae.|$|E
50|$|Peabody's second wife, Mary Gertrude Sullivan, was {{originally}} {{a resident of}} Hinsdale and was a possible influence on Peabody's decision to reside there. Peabody lived in 15 different houses during his career, but was most associated with his Hinsdale residence. The {{south side of the}} home was probably extended while <b>the</b> <b>Peabodys</b> lived there. <b>The</b> <b>Peabodys</b> moved into <b>the</b> Mayslake <b>Peabody</b> Estate in 1921.|$|R

Some of <b>the</b> <b>Peabody’s</b> {{earliest}} accessions, {{collected by}} Louis Agassiz {{and his son}} Alexander Emanuel Agassiz, form {{the main part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Peabody's</b> South American ethnographic collections. These include the collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century featherwork headdresses and ornaments from the Amazon Basin, Andean textiles and the William Farabee collection of Bolivian and Peruvian ceremonial and domestic objects. Important archaeological collections include Chimú, Nazca, and Moche pottery; Inca and Chimú metalwork; and a collection of prehistoric-period textiles.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> 1920s <b>Peabody</b> {{married his}} {{business}} manager Maude Kelly. After making several {{visits to the}} Mission Inn in Riverside, California, <b>the</b> <b>Peabodys</b> lived in Riverside from 1928 to 1939 when they divorced. In 1940 he married Ragna Kaupanger, a Norwegian-American nurse and United Airlines flight attendant. They had two children, Eddie Jr. and George Robert Peabody.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the arena}} opened in 1994 (and the {{original}} arena was demolished in 1999), renovations on {{the opera house}} did not begin until 2007. This was more than 15 years after the initial development plan. <b>The</b> <b>Peabody</b> Opera House (named for corporate contributor Peabody Energy) reopened on October 1, 2011, with performances by Jay Leno and Aretha Franklin.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Museum {{returned}} to the site with a thorough investigation that continued until 1968, led by Gordon R. Willey as director and A. Ledyard Smith as field director. Further excavations were carried out from May to June in 2006 by the Proyecto Arqueológico Ceibal-Petexbatun (Seibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project).|$|E
5|$|Music {{education}} throughout Maryland {{conforms to}} state standards, {{implemented by the}} Baltimore City Public School System. Music is taught to all age groups, and the city {{is also home to}} several institutes of higher education in music. <b>The</b> <b>Peabody</b> Institute's Conservatory is the most renowned music education facility in the area, and {{has been one of the}} top nationally for decades. The city is also home to a number of other institutes of higher education in music, the largest being nearby Towson University. <b>The</b> <b>Peabody</b> sponsors performances of many kinds, many of them classical or chamber music. Baltimore is home to the Baltimore Opera and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, among other similar performance groups. Major music venues in Baltimore include the nightclubs and other establishments that offer live entertainment clustered in Fells Point and Federal Hill.|$|E

In addition to Nahuatl, Whorf studied the Piman and Tepecano languages, while in close correspondence with linguist J. Alden Mason.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{satellite}} site of Akte was the ruin that Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño referred to as Tanxulukmul in early 1695.

5|$|The {{final two}} decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern {{scientific}} archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler. By the early 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the first {{two decades of}} the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts. Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.|$|E
5|$|Wilson Popenoe and {{his wife}} in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower {{mandible}} of a young Mayan woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of shell, shaped to resemble teeth.

5|$|Most of {{the major}} musical {{organizations}} in Baltimore were founded by musicians who trained at <b>the</b> <b>Peabody</b> Institute's Conservatory of Music. These include Baltimore Choral Arts, Baltimore Opera Company (BOC), and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO). These organizations all have excellent reputations and sponsor numerous performances throughout the year. Baltimore has produced a number of well-known modern composers of classical and art music, most famously including Philip Glass, a minimalist composer and Christopher Rouse, a Pulitzer winner. Glass {{grew up in the}} 1940s, working in his father's record store in East Baltimore, selling African American records, then known as race music. He was there exposed to Baltimore jazz and rhythm and blues.|$|E
