5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|Following the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Admiral Kinkaid {{requested}} a larger force of 25,000 troops {{to support an}} assault on Kiska. However, as there were not enough ships to transport such a large division to the Aleutians, Kinkaid suggested that the Americans' objective change from Kiska, which was defended by about 9,000 men, to Attu, which was home to only 500 Japanese. On April 1, Kinkaid received approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to execute the operation, codenamed SANDCRAB. The terrain of Attu Island was not hospitable for such an operation – much of the island's landmass not covered in snowy peaks was covered in muskeg, a marshy soil type <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to cross by foot. In addition, Attu Island was subject to frequent storms and soupy fogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of the}} Christianisation of Scotland {{has seen}} it as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. Historian Richard Fletcher argued that motivations for these missions may have included the example of St. Patrick, the idea of Peregrinatio and a growing interest in evangelism. Missionaries from Ireland were operating on the British mainland from at least the sixth century. This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of St. Ninian, St. Kentigern and St. Columba. However, historian Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E

25|$|But topological {{dimension}} {{is a very}} crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills {{up most of the}} area of a region. A fractal has an integer topological dimension, {{but in terms of the}} amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.|$|E
25|$|Modern composers {{will often}} specify the beating spot {{to alter the}} sound of the drum. When the timpani are struck {{directly}} in the center, they have a sound <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> completely devoid of tone and resonance. George Gershwin uses this effect in An American in Paris. Struck close to the edge, timpani produce a very thin, hollow sound. This effect is used by composers such as Bartók, Bernstein, and Kodály.|$|E

Its bedrock is primarily Fordham gneiss, a high-grade heavily banded metamorphic rock containing significant amounts of pink feldspar.

25|$|A {{new species}} of Temnodontosaurus was {{described}} in 2012 as T. azerguensis by paleontologist Jeremy Martin of University of Bristol. The species was described from a holotype <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> a complete skeleton from the Bifrons ammiote zone, Middle Toarcian. It was found by 1984 by M. Dejob and Ms. Laurent from the Lafarge Quarry in Belmont d’Azergues, Rhone, France. (The name azerguensis came from {{the name of the}} river and valley near the Belmont quarry where it was found, ‘Azergues’.) It is at the Musee des Amis de la Mine in Saint-Pierre La Palud, Rhone department, France.|$|E
25|$|The ancient {{societies}} that were rooted in India left behind artwork <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> indestructible {{on how to}} kill animals during a hunt. The images showing how to kill most effectively depending on the game being hunted relay an intimate knowledge of both external and internal anatomy {{as well as the}} relative importance of organs. The knowledge was mostly gained through hunters preparing the recently captured prey. Once the roaming lifestyle was no longer necessary it was replaced in part-by the civilization that formed in the Indus Valley. Unfortunately, there is little that remains from this time to indicate whether or not dissection occurred, the civilization was lost to the Aryan people invading.|$|E
