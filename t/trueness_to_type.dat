40|$|Fiano {{is a white}} grapevine variety from {{southern}} Italy, in the Campania region around Naples. It produces the prestigious wine Fiano di Avellino and, {{as is the case}} with many old varieties in Europe, it has been known under a number of synonyms. There is a growing interest in Fiano in Australia, with some lovely complex and textural wines produced from initial plantings in diverse regions, including McLaren Vale and Langhorne Creek, in South Australia. However, during the workshop ‘A little southern Italy in the Barossa’ held in the Barossa Valley in January, there was some discussion regarding the variety of Fiano from around Avellino and the variety known as Fiano Aromatico (aromatic Fiano), Fiano Minutolo or Minutolo, found on the eastern side of southern Italy, in the Puglia region. It was also referred to in the workshop as Fiano di Bari, which is most likely an erroneous short form referring to Fiano from the province of Bari, in Puglia. The question was raised about whether the variety from Puglia was the same as the Fiano from Campania and, if it was different, what were the Fianos we had in Australia. In order to ensure which variety or varieties are in Australia, an international comparison was carried out between Italy, Australia and France, utilising the commercial DNA testing facility in Montpellier, France. This DNA testing also ﬁtted in with the ‘Ensuring <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> of some alternative varieties’ project funded by the GWRDC and other industry bodies (see the November/December issue, pages 54 - 58, and this issue, pages 52 - 56, of the Wine & Viticulture Journal), with the testing of the extra Fiano material funded by Adelaide Hills Vine Improvement Inc. (AHVII). Fiano is one of a number of varieties that are new to commercial Australian viticulture, and there is no knowledge of what it should look like. In light of the recent Savagnin/Albariño situation, it was important to conﬁrm the identity of a variety that is likely to be planted in increasing numbers before too many vineyards are planted. When this variety was introduced into Australia the option of commercial DNA testing to conﬁrm <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> did not exist...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Apple (Malus pumila Mill.) and pear (Pyrus communis L.), {{commonly}} known as pome fruits, are important deciduous fruit crops in South Africa. The challenges of climate change, disease incidence, distant markets and fluctuating consumer preferences necessitate new cultivars. The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Infruitec-Nietvoorbij conducts a breeding programme aimed at developing new cultivars that are well adapted, resistant to pests and diseases and good storage potential. A recent review of the pome fruit gene banks, the breeders’ raw material, revealed misidentification and poor characterisation limitating the efficiency of its utilisation. To address these problems, the current study used microsatellite markers to investigate the <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> of accessions in the ARC gene banks. In addition, accessions of apple identified as true to type, were genotyped for the ACS 1 gene involved with ethylene production and fruit ripening. Two sets of 12 microsatellite markers recommended by a European working group on Pyrus/Malus, one for apple and one for pear, were utilised to fingerprint 540 apple and 197 pear accessions. Eleven and eight of 12 markers, were used respectively to successfully discriminate across the apple and pear accessions, {{with the exception of}} clones and sports of particular cultivars. Where possible, fingerprints were compared with those of their reported parents. The use of recommended markers facilitated the comparison of ARC pear accessions with those of the collection in Brogdale (UK). <b>Trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> of accessions were established and misidentified accessions were also detected. A similar comparison will be conducted for apple when the Brogdale apple accessions fingerprints become available. Several accessions were found to be false, 78 apple and 22 pear, and removal from the collection was recommended. For ACS 1 genotyping of 292 apple accessions, customised fluorescently labelled ACS 1 -Pr were used rather than the published ACS 1 - 5 primers. Of the 292 apple accessions, 29 were homozygous for the b allele associated with low ethylene and good storage potential. Novel size variation in one allele of the ACS 1 gene, was detected in some Malus species and ornamental hybrids. Successful amplification in a multiplex reaction was achieved and proves to be a cost effective method for simultaneous molecular fingerprinting and ACS 1 genotyping. True to type material will facilitate confident use of genetic resources in the breeding programmes, and the ACS 1 genotypes will identify candidate parents for developing good storage performing cultivars for distant markets.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} level of {{redundancy}} {{in a collection of}} cultivated lettuce, data from 160 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments and 10 polymorphic microsatellites were used in combination with passport data and morphological data, the latter obtained from an experimental field trial performed for verification purposes. Based on the observed distribution of the number of marker differences between and within accessions, a minimum of three AFLP differences and two microsatellite differences were regarded as levels warranting distinction between accessions in the redundancy analysis. The strategy followed in the redundancy analysis was mainly based on the confirmation of duplication by each of two independently generated data sources. The molecular data were used for the validation as well as the identification of potential duplicates, revealing a total number of 198 redundancies, corresponding to 12. 9 % of the total collection. <b>Trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type,</b> number of characterization and evaluation data, and collection management considerations, such as available seed quantities and germination percentages, were used as primary, secondary and tertiary criteria to decide which accession from duplication groups to maintain in the collection.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) dates back to 1984. The idea was to virtually assemble all accessions maintained in the worldwide existing collections to face genetic erosion. In many cases synonymy, homonymy and misnaming hampered the clear assignment of cultivars/accessions to prime names. In the past 15 years nuclear microsatellites, in particular the nine SSR-markers VVS 2, VVMD 5, VVMD 7, VVMD 25, VVMD 27, VVMD 28, VVMD 32, VrZAG 62 and VrZAG 79 were extensively applied for cultivar recognition in combination with ampelography. Genetic fin- gerprints of more than 15, 000  cultivars/accessions were collected. They were taken from more than 300 articles and from microsatellite databases on the web. Allele sizes were adapted according to own internal reference varieties. Comparison of profiles revealed new identities like: “Corbeau” = “Sevilhao”, “Gragnelut” = “Fer”, “Beretinjak” = “Bianco d’Alessano”. The activities aim to equip the prime names of VIVC with reliable genetic profiles combined with the validation of their identity by ampelography. Fingerprints from 1, 500 cultivars were already uploaded in VIVC. Two distinct search modules were imple- mented: “Microsatellites by varieties” and “Microsatellites by profiles”. The implementation assists the management of grape- vine genetic resources, e. g. <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> assessment in grapevine collections and serves research and breeding...|$|E

This study was conducted to develop a feasible means of determining the genetic stability of plants that were subjected to mass multiplication by micropropagation. Plants collected from the vicinities of Sindh were subjected to virus indexing regimes and DAS-ELISA was used to check the status of the mother plants to be multiplied. To develop a cost effective protocol of micropropagation, sucrose was successfully replaced with table sugar, and agar with surgical cotton.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Raspberries {{have been}} popular {{since the time}} of the ancient Greeks. Red {{raspberries}} are cultivated throughout the world, particularly in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) causes significant reduction in yield and crumbly fruit in raspberries, blackberries and raspberry-blackberry hybrids. There is no effective treatment once a plant is infected and the only effective prevention is using resistant varieties. Resistance is difficult to attain using traditional cultivation techniques. Through transgenic modification, five lines of resistant red raspberries have been developed from the 'Meeker' cultivar. To investigate <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type,</b> flavor characteristics for raspberries grown in Oregon and Washington during 2004 and 2005 were compared. Aroma volatiles important to the raspberry aroma profile were quantified, as well as the sugar and organic acid profiles, to compare the five transgenic 'Meeker' lines with the wild type 'Meeker', 'Chilliwack', 'Tulameen', 'Willamette' and 'Yellow Meeker'. Thirty aroma compounds ((Z) - 3 -hexenol, 4 -isopropylbenzyl alcohol, 6 - methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -ol, 2 -nonanol, hexanal, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl nonanoate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, raspberry ketone, zingerone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, para-cymene, geraniol, α-ionone, β-ionone, limonene, linalool, myrcene, nerol, α-phellandrene, α-pinene, sabinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpineol, terpinen- 4 -ol and terpinolene) were selected and quantified using stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) paired with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in all raspberry samples. The chiral stereoisomers of some volatile compounds in these raspberries were also studied using a cyclosilB GC column. Different raspberry cultivars varied widely in titratable acidity, sugar and acid concentration, and volatile composition, particularly α-ionone, linalool and (Z) - 3 -hexenol. Chiral compositions were also quite different among the cultivars studied. For the wild type 'Meeker' and RBDV-resistant varieties, flavor variations were observed from sites to sites and year to year. However, overall volatile profile had much less variations compared with sugar and organic acid profiles. None of the analyses separated the transgenic 'Meeker' raspberries from the wild type 'Meeker', and result was consistent for both of the locations and years studied.

Miscanthus seed are small, germination is often poor and without sterilisation so germination detection must be sufficiently adaptable for example to {{the presence or absence}} of mould. Results: Machine learning using k-NN improved the scoring of different seed phenotypes encountered in scoring germination for Miscanthus. The k-NN-based algorithm was effective in scoring the germination of seed images when compared with human scores of the same images. The trueness of the k-NN result was 0. 69 to 0. 7, as measured using the area under a ROC curve. When the k-NN classifier was tested on an optimised image subset of seed an area under the ROC curve of 0. 89 was achieved. Conclusions: With non-ideal seed images that included mould and broken seed the k-NN classifier was less consistent with human assessments. The most accurate assessment of germination with which to train classifiers is difficult to determine but the k-NN classifier provided an impartial consistent measurement of this important trait. It was more reproducible than the existing human scoring methods and was demonstrated to give a high degree of <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> the human score. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

Nevinson showed that cubism was not a gimmick, but a technique that emerged naturally from the art of its time. Bell articulated a formalist aesthetic that coincided with Gallatin's belief that art was not good because of its realism, but because the two-dimensional space of the painting, drawing, or print possessed a satisfying composition, line, shape, color, and texture. Pictorial representation, <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> life, and the illusion of depth were secondary concerns.

40|$|Managing {{pests and}} {{diseases}} in berry breeding programs is of primary importance {{and as such}} is a continuous ongoing process at several levels. An apriori condition is to maintain constant field monitoring: not only where several crops are present {{at the same time}} but also at different developmental stages of the plants from seed to postharvest. For correct management during fruit production, evaluations of pest and disease resistance on single genotypes or varieties are essential. Whilst a wide germplasm base contributes beneficially to the enrichment of the ecosystem, the balance has to be carefully maintained in order to make plants fruiting for the selection process. Although the FEM programs are run at a single site, different environments are present and tunnels, glasshouses or open fields affect pest and diseases pressure on the plants in different ways. Field based phenomics, together with genomic tools are valuable analytical methods in berry breeding. At FEM, fruit quality {{is one of the main}} objectives of the blueberry, raspberry, and strawberry breeding and germplasm evaluation programs. During the selection or evaluation process, destructive and nondestructive specific phenotyping techniques and instruments are applied, to model analyses that ensure an efficient and robust dissection of agronomic and fruit quality related traits. One of the traits that was identified as primarily important for quality characterization for most of the berry classes is texture. Texture analyses were modelled first on known cultivars and other quality parameters correlated to it and then applied and used as a tool to assist breeding and focus the selection of those phenotypes that better fit for specific identified and derived fruit categories (eg: storage or processing attitude). However, this method is destructive, so, based on the identified textural properties, a coupled laser Doppler vibrometry non-destructive technique was also modelled and applied to berry phenotyping and this allowed also to work toward a clustering of D. suzukii infested fruits and berries that were not infested. Amongst others, also compounds of the secondary metabolism of the plants appear to differently correlate with fruit quality traits in the different species with tolerance to different pests and diseases. While genotyping is a potent tool for the programs to ensure <b>trueness</b> <b>to</b> <b>type</b> and pedigree tracking, applied genomics, used in different ways for the different berry crops and for the different traits, including pest and disease resistance, helps us to deliver more accurate predictions on performance relating to traits that are usually complex and affected by many genes.

Combined standard uncertainty (µc) was calculated from the square root of the quadratic addiction of µP and µT. To calculate expanded uncertainty (U), a coverage factor of 2 was applied to (µc). Additionally, uncertainties for the individual matrices were estimated. The estimated analytical measurement uncertainty, U, was 19 %. Calculated U for individual matrices were 17, 18, 16, 19 and 18 % for canned tuna, green peas, roasted peanuts, wheat bran and powder milk, respectively. The major contribution to the analytical measurement uncertainty estimated was the one associated <b>to</b> <b>trueness,</b> due <b>to</b> the high uncertainty associated to the reference material (14 %). Accordingly to the results obtained, niacin content in foodstuffs should be reported with 2 significant figures...|$|R

Righting responses (body movements) were recorded by acceleration registrography. Acceleration registrogram (ARC) obtained by the tests were divided into six types by method of Honjo and Ishihara. Sixty nine patients (31. 4 %) belonged <b>to</b> <b>type</b> I, presenting normal righting response. Eighty patients (36. 4 %) belonged <b>to</b> <b>type</b> II, 19 patients (8. 6 %) <b>to</b> <b>type</b> III, 37 patients (16. 8 %) <b>to</b> <b>type</b> IV, 5 patients (2. 3 %) <b>to</b> <b>type</b> V, and 10 patients (4. 5 %) <b>to</b> <b>type</b> VI.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{application}} of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to precious metal alloys used for {{the control of the}} process of recovery and recycling of scraps and waste of industrial processes. In particular, the possibility to obtain sensitivity and <b>trueness</b> comparable <b>to</b> the current systems used in industrial environment in the quantitative determination of the elements of interest was explored. The present study demonstrates that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy can be considered as a viable alternative to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for the determination of recovered precious metals. The limits of detection obtained are of the order of 0. 2 mg/g for all the elements considered. The maximum deviation with respect to the nominal concentrations is around 1 mg/g at concentrations around 20 mg/g (gold) corresponding to a relative error slightly higher than ± 5 %...|$|R
