5|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by {{the example of the}} British postal system, which issued its first stamp, the Penny Black, in 1840, the Belgian government supported the inauguration of a Belgian equivalent. Under the existing system, postage costs were paid by the receiver rather than <b>the</b> <b>sender,</b> which discouraged people from receiving, and therefore sending, letters. The idea of postage stamps, which would allow <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> to pay in advance, was officially sanctioned by Leopold I on the Loi apportant des modifications au régime des postes ("Law bringing modifications to the postal system") on 24 December 1847 while the radical liberal and future Prime Minister, Walthère Frère-Orban, served as Minister of Public Works. The debate on the reform of the postage in Belgium occurred {{at the same time as}} widespread postage reform, {{influenced by}} the British example, in France, Bavaria and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account.

5|$|The RFC 6520 Heartbeat Extension tests TLS/DTLS secure {{communication}} links by allowing a computer {{at one end}} of a connection to send a Heartbeat Request message, consisting of a payload, typically a text string, along with the payload's length as a 16-bit integer. The receiving computer then must send exactly the same payload back to <b>the</b> <b>sender.</b>|$|E

Two forms of {{political}} advertising on the Internet are permitted during parliamentary elections. First, during the election period – that is, the period between the day the writ of election is issued and the start of polling day – political parties, candidates or election agents may use the Internet to further candidates' campaigns, including using websites, chat rooms or discussion forums, video and photograph sharing or hosting websites, e-mail, micro-blog posts (such as Twitter), SMS and MMS messages, digital audio and video files, electronic media applications, and blogs and social networking services (such as Facebook). Election advertising sent by e-mail, micro-blog post, SMS or MMS must contain a functioning e-mail address or mobile phone number to enable recipients to indicate that they do not wish to receive further messages from <b>the</b> <b>sender.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} private sender {{information into}} a sender-receiver game of Bayesian persuasion with monotonic sender preferences. I derive properties of increasing differences {{related to the}} precision of signals and use these to fully characterize the set of equilibria robust to the intuitive criterion. In particular, all such equilibria are either separating, i. e., <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> choice of signal reveals his private information to the receiver, or fully disclosing, i. e., the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> chosen signal fully reveals the payoff-relevant state to the receiver. Incentive compatibility requires <b>the</b> high <b>sender</b> type to use sub-optimal signals and therefore generates a cost for <b>the</b> high <b>sender</b> type in comparison to a full information benchmark in which the receiver knows <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> type. <b>The</b> receiver prefers the equilibrium outcome over this benchmark for large classes of monotonic sender preferences...|$|R
40|$|Secure one-to-many {{multicasting}} {{has been}} a popular re-search area in the recent past. Secure many-to-many mul-ticasting is becoming popular with applications such as private conferencing and distributed interactive simulation. Most of the existing secure multicasting protocols use a cen-tralized group manager to enforce access control and for key distribution. In the presence of multiple senders it is de-sirable to delegate group management responsibility to all <b>the</b> <b>senders.</b> We propose a distributed group key manage-ment scheme to support secure many-to-many communica-tion.

50|$|The mutual {{information}} {{can be understood as}} a measure for 'prior' uncertainty the receiver has about <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> signal (H(Y)), diminished by the uncertainty that is left after receiving information about <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> signal (H(Y | X)). Of course the decrease in uncertainty is due to the communicated amount of information, which is I(Y; X).|$|R
25|$|When {{using the}} Ganzfeld {{experiment}} {{to test for}} telepathy, one individual is designated the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where they are deprived of sensory input, and another is designated <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> and is placed in a separate location.

25|$|Because the IP {{address of}} <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> and the {{recipient}} are not both in cleartext at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping {{at any point}} along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient {{it appears that the}} last Tor node (called the exit node), rather than <b>the</b> <b>sender,</b> is the originator of the communication.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> himself, and such assertions may or may not relieve <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity; and, therefore, <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).|$|E
30|$|The second {{reference}} uses practical network coding [25] {{to transmit}} the stream. Since <b>the</b> <b>senders</b> are uncoordinated, {{they are not}} aware of the number of other <b>senders</b> or <b>the</b> capacities of their channels. Therefore, they use a coding window of the same size of the generation (i.e., {{the same size as the}} GOP). This technique is labeled PNC in the figures. In our scenario, each of <b>the</b> <b>senders</b> generates as many packets as it is the rank of the input generation, i.e., no redundancy is added by <b>the</b> <b>senders.</b> However, from <b>the</b> receiver side, the redundancy is inherent in having M> 1 uncoordinated senders transmitting linear combinations of <b>the</b> same <b>sender</b> generation. So, in each of our scenarios, the redundancy is r=(M− 1)/M.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{strategic}} disclosure between multiple senders and {{a single}} receiver. <b>The</b> <b>senders</b> are competing for prizes awarded by the receiver. They decide whether to disclose a piece of information that is both verifiable and equivocal (it can influence the receiver both ways). Then the standard unraveling argument breaks down: if the commonly known probability that her information is favorable is sufficiently high, a single sender never discloses. Competition restores full disclosure only if some of <b>the</b> <b>senders</b> are sufficiently unlikely to have favorable information. When <b>the</b> <b>senders</b> are uncertain about each other’s strength, however, all symmetric equilibria approach full disclosure as competition increases...|$|R
50|$|To {{calculate}} a PBE in a signaling game, {{we consider}} {{two kinds of}} equilibria: a separating equilibrium and a pooling equilibrium. In a separating equilibrium each sender-type plays a different action, so <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> action gives information to the receiver; in a pooling equilibrium, all sender-types play the same action, so <b>the</b> <b>sender's</b> action gives no information to the receiver.|$|R
25|$|Volapuk and Translit {{have been}} in use {{since the early days}} of the Internet to write e-mail {{messages}} and other texts in Russian where the support of Cyrillic fonts was limited: either <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> did not have a keyboard with Cyrillic letters or the receiver did not necessarily have Cyrillic screen fonts. In the early days, the situation was aggravated by a number of mutually incompatible computer encodings for the Cyrillic script, so that <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> and receiver were not guaranteed to have the same one. Also, the 7-bit character encoding of the early days was an additional hindrance.|$|E
25|$|A SYN flood {{occurs when}} a host sends a flood of TCP/SYN packets, often with a forged sender address. Each of these packets are handled like a {{connection}} request, causing the server to spawn a half-open connection, by sending back a TCP/SYN-ACK packet (Acknowledge), and waiting for a packet in response from <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> address (response to the ACK Packet). However, because <b>the</b> <b>sender</b> address is forged, the response never comes. These half-open connections saturate the number of available connections the server can make, keeping it from responding to legitimate requests until after the attack ends.|$|E
