5|$|Sequencing of the rbcL and matK {{chloroplast}} {{genes of}} Lilium and related genera confirmed the circumscription {{of the family}} in the sensu stricto usage of Tamura (1998). Chloroplast ndhF gene sequencing also supported Liliaceae monophyly, reuniting the Liliaceae sensu Tamura and Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (see <b>Table</b> <b>2</b> & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see <b>Table</b> <b>2</b> & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in <b>Table</b> <b>2.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1879, a {{revision}} of the North American Liliaceae by Sereno Watson described sixteen tribes, of which the Lilieae correspond most closely to current concepts of the family, Bentham and Hooker described twenty tribes in 1883, and Engler and Prantl in their extensive description of the Liliaceae in 1899 identified 31 tribes distributed over 11 subfamilies, with Tulipeae and Alieae representing the modern family. In 1936, Franz Buxbaum undertook a major revision of the Liliaceae and among others described the subfamily Lilioideae with three tribes: Lloydieae (Gagea, Lloydia and Szechenya and Giradiella — both now included in Lloydia), Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa and Eduardoregalia — now part of Tulipa) and Lilieae (Korolkowia, Fritillaria, Notholirion, Cardiocrinum, Nomocharis and Lilium). Hutchinson included most of these genera within the Tulipeae tribe. The complex rearrangements of the various genera, tribes and subfamilies over a 30-year period from 1985, discussed by Peruzzi and colleagues (2009), are partly summarised in <b>Table</b> <b>2</b> below.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the ncRNA molecules that are encoded by discrete genes, the initial transcripts of protein coding genes usually contain extensive noncoding sequences, {{in the form of}} introns, 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR), and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR).

25|$|A {{group of}} hand {{surgeons}} {{realized in the}} 1970s {{that the level of}} injury did not predict the number of available muscles in the upper limb very well.

It was called “The international classification (IC) of hand surgery in tetraplegic patients” (<b>table</b> <b>2)</b> and it describes the number of possible transferable muscles. To measure and evaluate hand strength each muscle is tested and all muscles with a BMRC grade of M4 or more are recorded.|$|E

While comparing to the supervised methods applied to time series dataset (<b>Tables</b> <b>2</b> and 4) one observes an error increase of 21 % for the 1991 – 2011 period and an error reduction of 22 % for the 2002 – 2011 and 2005 – 2011 periods.|$|R
25|$|Note: Tabulated {{formulas}} in <b>Table</b> <b>2</b> {{make the}} h-equivalent circuit of the transistor from Figure6 agree with its small-signal low-frequency hybrid-pi model in Figure7. Notation: r = base resistance of transistor, rO = output resistance, and gm = transconductance. The negative sign for h21 reflects the convention that I1, I2 are positive when directed into the two-port. A non-zero value for h12 means the output voltage affects the input voltage, that is, this amplifier is bilateral. If h12 = 0, the amplifier is unilateral.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine is {{the most}} potent SSRI drug available, but it is less {{selective}} for SERT than fluvoxamine and sertraline. Paroxetine also has weak NET inhibition which could contribute to its efficacy in depression, especially at higher doses. As demonstrated in <b>table</b> <b>2,</b> paroxetine also inhibits the NOSs enzyme which could be the reason for its sexual dysfunction adverse effect, especially in men. Paroxetine shows the highest affinity for muscarinic receptors of all the SSRIs which results in weak anticholinergic activity and therefore undesirable adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{tables and}} {{pictures}} below show the geographical distribution of internet access in China.

We can infer from these statistics that users come from a relatively privileged strata of the population, dwelling in highly urbanized settings and concentrated in the prosperous Eastern regions.|$|E
