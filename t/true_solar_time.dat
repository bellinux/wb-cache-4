The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze and interpret the signs - elements of the composition, incised on the outer side surface of the vessel of the Late Bronze Age, owned to Srubna culture and discovered near the Staropetrovsky village in the northeast of the Donetsk region. The measurements and astronomical calculations revealed that all signs have astronomical meaning. Fourray star has been interpreted as the star Sirius. The sign polyline has been interpreted as an analog of graphic of equation of time in which the testimony of a water clock correspond with average solar time, and the testimony of a sundial - the <b>true</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time.</b> Sign wheel has been interpreted as a complex of lines, reflecting the regularity changing the direction of the shadows from the gnomon at sunset at the equinoxes and solstices. The sign thin polyline has been interpreted as a symbol of change of height of the Sun in the meridian at the equinoxes and solstices. Interpretation of wheel and polyline is related to the definition of the duration of the day. Sign of the wheel shows a direct relationship the duration of the day on the magnitude of the azimuth of sunrise/sunset, and thin polyline - from changing the height of the Sun in the meridian. Thus Staropetrovsky vessel, thanks to the astronomical signs, is a kind of ancient astronomical visual aid, which reflects the level of astronomical knowledge of the priesthood of Srubna culture at the late Bronze Age.

40|$|Atmospheric tides are {{the primary}} source of daily air {{pressure}} variation at the surface of Mars. These tides are forced by solar heating of the atmosphere and modulated by the presence of atmospheric dust, topography, and surface albedo and thermal inertia. This results in a complex mix of sun-synchronous and nonsun- synchronous tides propagating both eastward and westward around the planet in periods that are integer fractions of a solar day. The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station on board the Mars Science Laboratory has observed air pressure at a regular cadence for over 1 Mars year and here we analyze and diagnose atmospheric tides in this pressure record. The diurnal tide amplitude varies from 26 to 63 Pa with an average phase of 0424 local <b>true</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time,</b> while the semidiurnal tide amplitude varies from 5 to 20 Pa with an average phase of 0929.

We supplement our analysis with MarsWRF general circulation modeling to examine how a local dust storm impacts the diurnal tide in its vicinity. We find that both the diurnal tide amplitude enhancement and regional coverage of notable amplitude enhancement linearly scales with the size of the local dust storm.

Irradiance and irradiation are defined; we explain {{the origin of}} the energy emitted by the sun and reaching the ground and its amount {{as a function of the}} wavelength â€“ the spectral distribution. The energy reaching the earth depends on the geometry of the earth relative to the Sun. This geometry is described as well as its variation throughout the year. The concept of time is very important in solar radiation. It is detailed here and the notions of mean solar time and <b>true</b> <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> are dealt with. The apparent course of the sun in the sky is described; the zenithal, elevation and azimuth angles are defined. We offer a series of equations to compute the radiation at the top of the atmosphere â€“ the extraterrestrial irradiation- for any instant and for any inclined surface. During its path downwards to the ground, the constituents of the atmosphere deplete the incident light. We introduce the concepts of scattering a! nd absorption. We discuss the main processes affecting the incident radiation in clear and cloudy atmospheres, and especially the effects of molecules, aerosols, gases and clouds. Several examples are given that illustrate atmospheric effects as a function of the solar zenithal angle and atmospheric optical properties. The spectral distribution of the irradiance is discussed for several different conditions. The direct, diffuse and reflected components of the irradiance are defined.

40|$|The Visible InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) {{on board}} the orbiter of the ESA Rosetta mission {{operates}} in the spectral range 0. 25 - 5. 1 μm. VIRTIS is continually used to map and investigate the surface composition of the comet nucleus in its uppermost layer within a depth of a few tens of microns. Moreover, the temperature of these surface layers can be mapped utilizing VIRTIS’ long wavelength spectral measurements. To do this, the VIRTIS team uses a Bayesian approach to nonlinear inversion, which was already adopted {{in the past for}} other small bodies. The superficial layer sampled by VIRTIS is significantly different from the much thicker layers sampled by the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO). Furthermore, VIRTIS is not sensitive to physical temperatures on the nightside of the comet, where the signal is considerably low. Typically, 170 K is the minimum surface temperature that can be measured while preserving small formal errors (< 1 K on retrieved temperatures). Temperatures below 170 K have increasingly lower accuracy, and should be carefully interpreted. In previous papers, we have provided a thorough description of surface temperature maps and thermal properties of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as derived from infrared data acquired by Rosetta/VIRTIS in the early Mapping phase carried out in August and September 2014. We divided those maps into intervals of <b>true</b> local <b>solar</b> <b>time</b> and we evaluated, for the available coverage, the average daily temperatures. In addition, we studied correlations between temperature and albedo at different wavelengths, and derived diurnal temperature profiles for several local sites, representative of as many macro-regions of the comet. In this new work, we focus on effects determined by the season and the heliocentric distance. Due to the low thermal inertia of the nucleus surface material, the surface temperature is essentially dominated by the instantaneous value of the solar incidence angle. Small values of this angle result in high surface temperatures, but, due to comet 67 P’s obliquity, for each location the smallest achievable value of insolation angle depends on the season.
