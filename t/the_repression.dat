5|$|Hao Fengjun, another {{defector}} to Australia, {{had worked}} for the 610 Office of Tianjin city and claims that his job involved the collection and analysis of intelligence reports on Falun Gong from Europe, Australia, and North America. The implication was that local 610 offices are involved in the espionage efforts abroad. Another defector from China's Ministry of State Security—which conducts both domestic and international intelligence—claimed that <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> and monitoring of underground Christians and Falun Gong practitioners is a major focus of the ministry.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} effected drastic cuts to {{the military}} budget, and privatized military factories. Menem appointed Lt. Gen. Martín Balza, who had performed well during <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of Seineldín's mutiny, as the Army's General Chief of Staff (head of the military hierarchy). The death of a conscript soldier in 1994, victim of abuses by his superiors, led to the abolition of conscription in the country. The following year, Balza voiced the first institutional self-criticism {{of the armed forces}} during the Dirty War, saying that obedience did not justify the actions committed in those years.|$|E

50|$|The Society {{flourished in}} the Duchy of Warsaw and Congress Poland, but was {{eventually}} dissolved by the Russian authorities {{in the aftermath of}} the failed November Uprising of 1830-31, when many Polish cultural organizations were delegalized as part of <b>the</b> <b>repressions.</b> <b>The</b> Society's traditions were continued by the Warsaw Scientific Society (Towarzystwo Naukowe Warszawskie).|$|R
5|$|Vizzini is {{the central}} {{character}} {{in the history of}} direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. After World War II he became the personification of the reinstatement of Cosa Nostra during the Allied occupation and the subsequent restoration of democracy after <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> under Fascist rule. Initially he supported the separatist movement, but changed allegiance to the Christian Democrat party, {{when it became clear that}} Sicilian independence was unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of Diệm, various American {{sanctions}} that were implemented against South Vietnam in response to <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of the Buddhist crisis and Nhu's Special Forces' Xá Lợi Pagoda raids, were lifted.

5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to <b>the</b> <b>repression,</b> but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E
50|$|Sengiin Erdene {{was born}} on December 7, 1929 in Binder, Khentii Province. His father, a herder from Buryatia {{who had come to}} Mongolia a few years previous, was killed during <b>the</b> <b>repressions</b> of <b>the</b> late 1930s.|$|R
40|$|Expression of the Escherichia coli sdhCDAB operon {{encoding}} the succinate dehydrogenase {{complex is}} regulated {{in response to}} growth conditions, such as anaerobiosis and carbon sources. An anaerobic repression of sdhCDAB {{is known to be}} mediated by the ArcB/A two-component system and the global Fnr anaerobic regulator. While the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and Cra (formerly FruR) are known as key mediators of catabolite repression, they have been excluded from <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> of <b>the</b> sdhCDAB operon. Although <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> of sdhCDAB was reported to involve a mechanism dependent on the ptsG expression, the molecular mechanism underlying <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> has never been clarified. In this study, we re-examined the mechanism of <b>the</b> sdhCDAB <b>repression</b> by glucose and found that CRP directly regulates expression of the sdhCDAB operon and that <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> of this operon occurs in a cAMP-dependent manner. The levels of phosphorylated enzyme IIAGlc and intracellular cAMP on various carbon sources were proportional to the expression levels of sdhC-lacZ. Disruption of crp or cya completely abolished <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> of sdhC-lacZ expression. Together with data showing correlation between the intracellular cAMP concentrations and the sdhC-lacZ expression levels in several mutants and wild type, in vitro transcription assays suggest that the decrease in the CRP·cAMP level in the presence of glucose is the major determinant of <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> of <b>the</b> sdhCDAB operon...|$|R

5|$|Moondram Pirai {{depicts a}} young woman whose mental state regresses {{to that of a}} child {{following}} an accident. Sexuality and <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual tension between the protagonists. Critic K. Jeshi compares Moondram Pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like Sethu... (1999), Pithamagan (2003), Perazhagan (2004), Chandramukhi (2005), Anniyan (2005) and Ghajini (2005). When asked about the reason amnesia was chosen for a disability, Mahendra said the disorder is used as a camouflage and as an excuse to portray relationships in the film.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{sentence}} aroused strong {{reactions in}} Italy {{and in the}} United States. In Palermo {{a group of students}} went to the Teatro Bellini and asked the orchestra to perform the hymn of Garibaldi. And the theatre applauded. In March 1896, after Crispi had to resign due to the humiliating defeat of the Italian army at Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia during First Italo-Ethiopian War, the new government under Prime minister Antonio Di Rudinì recognized the excessive brutality of <b>the</b> <b>repression.</b> Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail. Di Rudinì made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would not be tolerated. After their release, De Felice, Barbato and Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, cheering for socialism and denouncing Crispi.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} soldiers fulfilled {{a number}} of different purposes. Initially they were collaborators in the conquest of Indochina, helping to defeat the forces of the Nguyễn Dynasty and then in its pacification. After the pacification campaign was officially completed in 1897, the two main functions of the colonial army were the maintenance of internal peace and external security. Both these tasks were fulfilled in conjunction with other armed institutions, such as the Garde indigène (later indochinoise), the gendarmerie, the police, and the irregular partisans in the border regions. The Garde indigène, a paramilitary force, was primarily responsible for dealing with disturbances of the peace and thus {{played an important role in}} <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of public demonstrations and popular unrest.|$|E
50|$|Besides <b>the</b> <b>repressions</b> Jews had {{to endure}} in all Nazi Germany, {{including}} {{the destruction of the}} Pomeranian synagogues on November 9, 1938 (Reichskristallnacht), all male Stettin Jews were deported to Oranienburg concentration camp after this event and kept there for several weeks.|$|R

50|$|During the Polonization of the Grand Duchy in the 16th and 17th centuries, a {{large number}} of Orthodox Ruthenians, led by Princes Mstislavsky, Belsky and Galitzine, escaped <b>the</b> <b>repressions</b> to Moscow.

5|$|When {{the news}} of their plight reached the Parsis, who by this time had become quite prosperous, Parsi funds were set up to help the Iranian Zoroastrians and emissaries were {{dispatched}} to Iran. A Parsi philanthropist, Maneckji Limji Hataria, was sent to help them. He found only 7711 Zoroastrians in Kerman, Yazd and Tehran (now the capital of Iran). Using his influence with the British government {{he managed to get}} some of <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> against Zoroastrians removed. Jizya was paid by the Zoroastrian minority until 1882, when it was removed by pressure on the Qajar government from the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra, in his {{now defunct}} blog Moondram Pirai..., {{referred}} to the film as a suspense thriller, while N. Venkateswaran of The Times of India {{described it as a}} psychological thriller. Devika Bai, writing for the New Straits Times, referred to Moodu Pani as a whodunit film. K.Hariharan, director of the L. V. Prasad Film & TV Academy, noted that sexuality and <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> of desire were the dominant motifs in Moodu Pani, expressed through the mysterious misty atmospheres of Ooty where the protagonist confronts their psychological antagonist. He also noted that Moodu Pani, like many of Mahendra's films, borrowed its themes and stylistic devices from French New Wave and New Hollywood styles of filmmaking. Ilangovan noted that Chandru's character, which was depicted as having flashes of wickedness bordering on perversion, was new to Tamil cinema. Crime and detective fiction writer Pattukkottai Prabakar considers Moodu Pani, along with Sigappu Rojakkal and Nooravathu Naal (1984), to explore the personalities and behavioural traits of psychopaths in detail.|$|E
