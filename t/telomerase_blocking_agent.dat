40|$|This paper {{describes}} the collective behavior of <b>block</b> <b>agents</b> existing in a spatially constrained environment. The difficulty {{of this problem}} is {{the determination of the}} behavior of a <b>block</b> <b>agent</b> within an environment requiring mutual action of many <b>block</b> <b>agents.</b> This difficulty is caused by dynamic obstacle avoidance problem resulting from physical collisions among the autonomous motion of <b>block</b> <b>agents.</b> The objective of this research is to build an adaptive decision mechanism of behavior for autonomous <b>block</b> <b>agents</b> when they are given a task. Specifically, this paper shows one case study of the proposed mechanism for the problem of removing blocks from a container. It is assumed that <b>agents</b> are <b>block</b> shaped, have changeable postures, and they are existing in the automated warehouse. Our approach is uses Classifier System based architecture. The results of simulation experiments are presented which indicate the possibility of this architecture in allowing <b>block</b> <b>agents</b> to ad [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of applications, e. g. DNA/protein micro-array technology, {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, the covalent coupling of proteins to surfaces is required. Following the covalent coupling of proteins, the remaining reactive groups should be blocked {{in order to avoid}} covalent binding of the analyte to the reactive surface. To this end, preferably <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> containing groups that avoid nonspecific adsorption should be used. These <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> are typically ethanolamine and cysteine for protein coupling via amino groups and thiol groups, respectively. This report presents novel <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) groups. These <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> show enhanced qualities to avoid nonspecific adsorption and can therefore have advantages in versatile protein-surface technologies. D 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} {{the capacity for}} a variety of commonly used, low and high-molecular weight <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> to prevent nonspecific binding of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius to impedimetric gold electrodes. The <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> tested here were mercaptoundecanol (MCU), polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW≈ 1 kDa or 5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and chicken serum albumin (CSA). The surfactant Tween 20 was applied additionally in some conditions. BSA and MCU in combination with Tween 20 were found to yield the greatest blocking capacities, whereas 5 kPEG was found to actually enhance S. intermedius attachment. Although genetically and physiologically similar, S. intermedius and S. aureus differed significantly in their capacity to attach to the gold substrate. Monitoring of gold functionalization kinetics in real-time via impedance spectroscopy indicated that surface functionalization occurred within a few minutes of gold exposure to a given <b>blocking</b> <b>agent.</b> Higher impedance changes were observed with lower molecular weight <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> likely due to denser molecular packing on the gold substrate. Careful optimization of <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> with respect to chemical properties, molecular size and potential interactions is recommended...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the reason for}} discontinuation of the first tumor necrosis factor (TNF) <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> influences {{the effect of a}} second TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agent.</b> METHODS: Data were used from 2 Dutch registries including patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agents.</b> Patients were divided into 3 groups based on reason for discontinuation of the first: nonresponse, loss of response, or adverse events. The primary outcome was the change from baseline of the disease activity (by DAS 28) at 6 months, corrected for the baseline DAS 28 score. Secondary outcomes were the change from baseline at 3 months, EULAR response rates, and the percentages of patients who reached a DAS 28 score or = 0. 173) and similar good and moderate response rates were found (12 % to 18 %, p > or = 0. 523, and 34 % to 55 %, p > or = 0. 078, respectively). The secondary outcomes were also comparable between the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: The results of our observational study suggest that a second TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> may be effective after failure of the first, regardless of the reason for discontinuation of the first TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agent...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> are {{an important}} advance in the clinical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They were introduced into clinical practice while limited safety information was available. This means that intensive monitoring is needed early in {{the life cycle of}} these new drugs. Setting up large cohort studies to monitor efficacy, safety, and tolerability in long term use of these so-called biological agents will provide information about the consequences of using TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> in chronic rheumatic disease like RA. Currently, a Dutch multicentre registry on biological agents in RA is being set up. This study aimed at investigating the efficacy and toxicity of TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> in patients with RA at one participating academic centre by a drug survival analysis. Since 1997 230 patients with RA at the centre have been treated with TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> for the first time (94 with adalimumab, 120 with infliximab, and 16 with etanercept). No differences in drug survival between the three TNF <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> were found despite the diversity in selection and patient numbers. Adverse events which occurred, leading to discontinuation, were similar to those from previous reports...|$|R

30|$|For the {{incomplete}} steam breakthrough well, {{the mature}} breakthrough channel {{has not been}} formed. So for some calculating methods of <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> volume, this kind of well is not taken into consideration. Such design may not be appropriate because the motion and distribution of the <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> among complete breakthrough channels and incomplete breakthrough channels is a dynamic balance process. This phenomenon is especially obvious in the injection process of particle <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> (Alvarez et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2012 b). So if the blocking volume between the injector and the incomplete steam breakthrough producer is ignored, the designed <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> will partly flow to the incomplete breakthrough well. As a result, the designed blocking volume may not be sufficient enough to block the main breakthrough channel and the whole blockage effect will be weakened. In this article, the channel between the injector and incomplete producer is considered.|$|R
40|$|The time {{course of}} liver {{phosphorylase}} activation after catecholamine {{administration and the}} relative abilities of several adrenergic <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> to <b>block</b> catecholamine-induced phosphorylase activation in liver and skeletal muscle was studied in intact anesthetized rats. Subcutaneously injected epinephrine and norepinephrine increased the liver phosphorylase activity, the peak effect occurring 10 min after injection. The liver phosphorylase levels were somewhat reduced 30 min after injection. Isoproterenol administration did not increase the level of rat liver phosphorylase. Blood glucose changes after catecholamine treatment did not mirror the changes in liver phosphorylase activity. Complete blockade of the liver phosphorylase response to epinephrine was observed with the [alpha]-adrenergic <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> ergotamine. Phenoxybenzamine and two [beta]-adrenergic <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> dichloroisoproterenol and nethalide, gave partial blockade. These data indicate the difficulty in the classification of the liver metabolic receptor. The activation by epinephrine of skeletal muscle phosphorylase appears to be affected only by [beta]-adrenergic <b>blocking</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

However, {{termination of the}} effects of neuromuscular <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> has, until now, remained limited. A novel cyclodextrin encapsulation process offers improved termination of the paralytic effects of aminosteroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular <b>blocking</b> <b>agents.</b> Sugammadex sodium is the first in a new class of drug called selective relaxant binding agents. Currently, in clinical trials, sugammadex, a modified gamma cyclodextrin, has shown consistent and rapid termination of neuromuscular blockade with few side effects. The pharmacology of cyclodextrins in general and sugammadex in particular, together with the results of current clinical research are reviewed. The ability of sugammadex to terminate the action of neuromuscular <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> by direct encapsulation is compared to the indirect competitive antagonism of their effects by cholinesterase inhibitors. Also discussed are the clinical implications that extend beyond fast, effective reversal, including numerous potential perioperative benefits...|$|R
