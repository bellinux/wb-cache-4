It was that selective perception that enables you to say you were in an altered state?E: Yes, I did not do it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see the fence and large boulder that were there. I blocked out everything except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset.

3000|$|Most fundamentally, {{however, the}} overall lack of {{economic}} opportunities {{continues to be}} a powerful push factor in the decision to migrate. Wage differentials and better job opportunities are indeed the primary cause of emigration among Latin Americans (Clark, Hatton, & Williamson, 2003; Takenaka & Pren, 2010; [...] Durand & Massey, 2010). Unsurprisingly, in many of the conversations reported in Pérez-Armendáriz’s research, it is made clear that emigrants think that more opportunities became open to them thanks to emigration. For instance, a woman who arrived in the US and managed to complete high school communicated to her family that “[T] he government here [in the US] provides a lot of opportunities…” And an undocumented woman with a brother back home with learning disabilities stated “I am always <b>telling</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> that it is possible for adults with disabilities to work and become more independent.

40|$|Cross-linguistically, {{temporal}} and aspectual notions are often interpreted in spatial terms. In particular, {{the concept of}} ‘course of event’ tends to be represented as a path, and encoded through motion verbs followed by verbal complements expressing metaphorical destinations (e. g. "I can’t bring myself to <b>tell</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> my bad test results; I came to realise the problem was mechanical; Are you going to leave soon?"). English motion verb constructions allowing a temporal reinterpretation of this kind include "HAVE been to V" (e. g. "He {{said he had been}} to buy a packet of tabs") and "got back from V-ing" (e. g. "I’ve just got back from coaching the French Under 15 s in the ECC championships in Rome"), which can be glossed as ‘having just V-ed’. This paper examines co-text of use of the above constructions on the basis of data collected from the British English Web Corpus (ukWaC; 1, 500, 000, 000 words). "HAVE been to V" and "got back from V-ing" often co-occur with verbs of visual perception, mostly "see", and strongly correlate with the meanings of ‘examining/watching something’ and ‘paying a visit’, but more generally, they are associated with the representation of events classifiable as errands (exchanges of information/services, tasks, jobs). The data shows that "HAVE been to V" and "got back from V-ing" (a) represent processes of varying temporal nature (i. e. telic like "watch the game"; punctual like "take", and durative like "stay"), but compatible with the boundedness of the motional meaning of ‘going somewhere and returning’; (b) are associated with human, volitional subjects; (c) represent deliberate acts requiring a temporary change of location; (d) and express the notion of ‘coming back from getting something done’. Overall, the constructions simultaneously express both the spatial and the temporal facets characterizing given events. Their use as expressions of recent past (i. e. ‘having just V-ed’) is restricted to those cases where the notions of both round-trip motion and past performance can be said to co-exist or persist. This suggests that "HAVE been to V" and "got back from V-ing" either are in the infancy of their grammaticalization or illustrate instances of static grammaticalization, namely the entrenched, but marginal, use of lexical items in grammatical functions...|$|E

See, I come from a Nigerian, well-educated ambitious bunch of arguing intellectuals. My mother is a nurse my father was an engineer who in his youth, fought in the Biafran War. He refers to me as Wahalla or problem maker for seeking a life in the arts. There are not many artists in our family. In fact I think I am the first actually. And so I came to UCSD heart in throat, arms crossed wanting "my education" I got so much more. This is the place where I was basically told all Wahalla are welcome. And so for three years I got to explore the woman, the artist, the black girl, and the African within me. I was taught by the leading troublemakers in the country. And I am a better artist for it. And if I am lucky, when I am out there in real world I too will dash inspire a young crop of in coming Wahalla and keep the cycle moving...|$|R

While it focuses on living in New Orleans, experiencing segregation and World War II, the book contains several flashbacks: I write about the time my great-grandfather immigrated to the city from France, the period after Reconstruction when my grandfather served as State legislator, and the era of desegregation when my uncle and aunt were activists. ^ A chapter <b>tells</b> about about <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> 2 ̆ 7 courtship and marriage [...] a tale of doubt and frustration.

I tell of his fall [...] when politics and corruption led to investigations and trials. ^ While the time period stretches from the 18302 ̆ 7 s to the present, recurring themes and motifs establish continuity: I show the idyllic South (the romantic setting of Louisiana) contrasted with the realities beneath the surfaces: the flavor of life in New Orleans (food, flowers, and exquisite homes) pervades the atmosphere of the book, but dark moments of truth disturb that sensuous landscape. The ways members of my family respond to social change provides the drama for my narrative. The book is a tapestry of lives and events woven with autobiographical passages and commentary. ...|$|R
