500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel <b>tubular</b> <b>stock</b> {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E
50|$|The SUB-2000 is a pistol-caliber carbine {{manufactured}} by Kel-Tec CNC Industries of Cocoa, Florida, United States. The rifle is a blowback operated, semi-automatic firearm with its operating spring {{located in the}} <b>tubular</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The R4 has a side-folding <b>tubular</b> <b>stock,</b> which folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver. The rifle's handguard, pistol grip, magazine, stock arms and {{shoulder}} pad are all made from a synthetic material, making it lighter in weight than the equivalent original Galil model which uses heavier metal and wood in these components.|$|E

The C9A2 mid-life upgrade introduced a shorter barrel, green furniture, a C8-style collapsible stock, folding vertical foregrip and a laser aiming module (LAM). Two C9s are carried by each infantry section.|$|E
50|$|The Jeanie's Teenie is {{constructed}} primarily of aluminum, with stainless steel and steel {{making up the}} balance. Parts are made from sheet, angle, and <b>tubular</b> <b>stock.</b> The aluminum sheet and extruded angles are limited to two required thicknesses, thus simplifying purchases. Components are fastened using steel mandrel blind rivets of various length. The sheet metal is formed over wooden templates traced from the full sized plans. Very little welding is required, and is generally limited to the landing gear, motor mounts, and small control linkages. The airplane is small enough {{that it can be}} built in a garage, on a large table.|$|E

50|$|Metals may {{be drawn}} into a tubular shape, or <b>tubular</b> {{extruded}} <b>stock</b> can be machined to add threads for the head and tail cap, knurling for grip, and decorative and functional flats or holes in the body. LED flashlights may have cooling fins machined into their metal cases. Plastics are often injection molded into nearly final shape, requiring only a few more process steps to complete assembly.Metal cases provide better heat dissipation for the LED, but plastics are not electrically conductive and may resist corrosion and wear.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a compact {{variant of the}} SVD {{designed}} for airborne infantry was introduced, known as the SVDS (Russian: снайперская винтовка Драгунова складная, short for Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova Skladnaya, [...] "Dragunov Sniper Rifle with folding stock"), which features a <b>tubular</b> metal <b>stock</b> that folds {{to the right side}} of the receiver (equipped with a synthetic shoulder pad and a fixed cheek riser) and a synthetic pistol grip. The barrel was also given a heavier profile, the receiver housing was strengthened, the gas cylinder block was improved and a ported, conical flash hider was adopted.|$|R

5000|$|The rifle was {{developed}} in the late 1980s in response to a requirement to replace the 7.62mm Rk 62 service rifle. Between 1988 and 1990 the SAKO company developed the M90 prototype, which was a substantially upgraded variant of the Rk 62. Changes to the original design included the fire control and safety selector, whose lever was transferred to {{the left side of the}} receiver housing, the cocking handle cut-out in the bolt carrier assembly was covered with a strip of metal, the cocking handle itself was placed at an upward angle (enhancing left-handed reloading), the rear sight assembly was installed on a sliding tangent with 150, 300 and 400 m range adjustments and the rifle was equipped with a folding <b>tubular</b> <b>stock</b> with a latch modeled on the locking solution employed in the SIG SG 540 rifle. The M90 was also equipped with a multifunction muzzle device and manual gas valve, enabling the use of rifle grenades. After undergoing further testing and implementing several changes (among them, the selector mechanism was reverted to the familiar Rk 62 configuration) the rifle was introduced into service with the Finnish Army as the 7.62 RK 95 TP (Finnish: Rynnäkkökivääri 95 Taittoperä or [...] "assault rifle 95 folding stock").|$|E
40|$|Tube end {{spinning}} process has developed on the grounding of {{experiences in the}} work. This is the method of shaping <b>tubular</b> <b>stock</b> without the application of external heat during the shaping operation which consist in simultaneously relatively rotating the stock and a shaping tool about the axis of the tool while relatively moving the tool and the stock toward one another and while the stock is so heated by shaping tool with longitudinal relief area. Experimental results about torque, thrust and temperature are obtained by using several kinds of conical shape dies and copper tubes, are showing that the portion of relief area {{on the face of}} shaping die is so influence on the workability. ...|$|E
5000|$|SOE also revived some medieval devices, {{such as the}} caltrop, {{which could}} be used to burst the tyres of {{vehicles}} or injure foot soldiers and crossbows powered by multiple rubber bands to shoot incendiary bolts. There were two types, known as [...] "Big Joe" [...] and [...] "Lil Joe" [...] respectively. They had <b>tubular</b> alloy skeleton <b>stocks</b> and were designed to be collapsible for ease of concealment.|$|R
50|$|The {{stocks and}} handguards on M14Ks are {{shortened}} {{versions of the}} GI birch or walnut stock, but {{make use of the}} original front ferrule. The front sling mount is relocated slightly to rear, to accommodate the shortened stock. Most handguards are of the solid, fiberglass variety (albeit shortened), but a limited number were made with shortened wood handguards. The steel buttplate was deleted in favor of a rubber recoil pad, which greatly reduces perceived recoil. A limited number of M14Ks were manufactured with the BM-59 Alpine / Para folding stock. These too had the shortened stocks and handguards, making for an extremely compact package especially suited to vehicular and airborne operations. A couple of M14Ks were built for SEAL Team members using the <b>tubular</b> folding <b>stock</b> assembly on a cut-down M14E2 stock found on some of the Team's full-size M14s prior to adoption of the Sage International EBR stock for M14 applications. These are by far one of the rarest variants of the M14K.|$|R

25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic {{handguard}} and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) <b>tubular</b> steel skeleton <b>stock.</b> The rifle {{can be used with}} a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|R
50|$|The {{receiver}} {{is made of}} {{an impact}} modified glass reinforced Zytel. The front end houses a hinge block holding the barrel and the rear sight. This block is securely locked in place by a swiveling trigger guard. The receiver rigidly attaches to the stock by multiple lugs. The bottom of the receiver forms the pistol grip, also accepting different magazines according to the version specified. The receiver also houses the firing mechanism. The 4130 ordnance steel barrel has a spring-loaded collar to ensure an accurate lock between the receiver and the polymer fore end and the fully adjustable front sight. The fore end also has integrated the ability to house batteries and/or other small devices. The <b>tubular</b> steel <b>stock</b> contains the bolt and is ended by the polymer butt stock. The heavy two-piece steel bolt holds the firing pin, the extractor and has the operating handle on the bottom. A captive guide recoil spring with buffer actuates the bolt. The firing mechanism is of conventional single action type. It has a positive disconnector, a push bolt safety that blocks the sear and disengages the trigger bar. The hardened steel ejector is internal. This design, with its long bolt travel, allows for very large functioning marginals.|$|R
40|$|In a {{manufacturing}} environment {{it is often}} necessary to perform a manual inventory of finished goods and raw materials. These raw materials might be wood, plastic or metal and often represent a large investment of capital to procure and store. While the economic value of an accurate inventory is high, the process of obtaining a good count is tedious and fraught with human error. As a precursor to counting an inventory of <b>tubular</b> steel bar <b>stock</b> from digital images, we present a hybrid algorithm inspired by ant colony and particle swarm technology. This algorithm defines an environmental habitat for interacting particles to competitively cluster into segmented colonies. By forming colonies at bar stock end profile locations the algorithm provides potentially countable high-level information.

2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding <b>tubular</b> aluminum <b>stock</b> and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|R
