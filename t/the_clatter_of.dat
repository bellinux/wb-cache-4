500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "shanty-man"—the chorister {{of the old}} packet ship—has left no successors. In {{the place}} of a rousing [...] "pulling song," [...] we now hear the rattle of the steam-winch; and the modern {{windlass}} worked by steam, or the modern steam-pump, gives us <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> cogwheels and the hiss of steam in place of the wild choruses of other days. Singing and steam are irreconcilable. The hoarse steam-whistle is the nearest approach to music that can exist in the hot, greasy atmosphere of the steam-engine.|$|E
2500|$|Two cowboys, a {{newcomer}} and an old-timer, are drinking beer {{in front of}} a saloon. Suddenly, there is a clatter of hooves, a great cloud of dust, and something moving extremely fast from one end of town to the other. The newcomer looks at the old-timer, but seeing no reaction, decides to let the matter drop. However, several minutes later, the same cloud of dust, accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> hooves, rapidly proceeds in the other direction. Not being able to see what's behind the dust, and unable to contain his curiosity any longer, the newcomer asks: [...] "OK, what the hell was that, Bill?" [...] / [...] "Oh, that's Uncatchable Joe. Nobody has ever managed to catch him, Harry." [...] / [...] "Why? Is he so fast, Bill?" [...] / [...] "Nope, it's just because nobody needs him, Harry." [...] ('Variant: [...] "Nobody cares about him") ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Suddenly, I heard <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> Leycester's {{machine gun}} above {{the roar of}} the engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly {{there came}} <b>the</b> <b>clattering</b> <b>of</b> an opening door, and then Betty Martin's voice broke the silence, harshly, shrilly: [...] "Sal!--Sal!--Sally Martin! You, Sally Martin! Come in yere. Where be ye?" ...|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} {{courtyard}} rang with <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> hoofs. There was commotion below {{and in the}} palace.|$|E

60|$|From the distance, drawing rapidly nearer and ringing {{sharply in}} {{the stillness of the}} night, came <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> a mule's hooves.|$|E
60|$|From the {{distance}} now there came {{the sound of}} jingling bells and <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> horses' hoofs upon the cobble-stones of the streets.|$|E
60|$|It had all {{happened}} {{so quickly that}} I could scarcely realize it. The yelping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hounds, <b>the</b> <b>clattering</b> <b>of</b> stones, grew fainter, telling me Jude and Sounder, with Jones, {{were going to the}} bottom of the Bay.|$|R
60|$|Poor Whitewing looked upwards, {{as if he}} half {{expected}} to see the Saviour with the bodily eye, and a mist seemed to be creeping over him. He was roused from this semi-conscious state by <b>the</b> <b>clattering</b> <b>of</b> horses' hoofs.|$|R
6000|$|Hymn-of-Praise Busy {{waited a}} moment or two until <b>the</b> <b>clattering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pewter died away in the distance, then he edged a little closer to the table whereat Mistress Charity seemed still very busy with the fruit, and said haltingly: ...|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes {{may have}} passed, and then I heard <b>the</b> <b>clatter</b> <b>of</b> many steps, and {{a knot of}} men came {{clustering}} through the door.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>clattering</b> <b>of</b> handspikes preceded <b>the</b> mariners song. Then {{the heavy}} labour, {{by which the}} {{ponderous}} iron was lifted from the bottom, was again resumed, and, {{in a few more}} minutes, the ship was once more released from her hold upon the land.|$|R
60|$|But {{here the}} voice of Bucklaw, heard even above <b>the</b> <b>clattering</b> <b>of</b> hoofs and braying of horns with which it mingled, {{announced}} that he was scaling the pathway to the Tower {{at the head of the}} greater part of the gallant hunting train.|$|R
60|$|Then {{all were}} {{intensely}} quiet, watching the racers come trotting {{in single file}} down the ridge. Sarchedon's shrill neigh, like a whistle-blast, pealed in from the sage.
