5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem {{also makes it}} very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and <b>the</b> <b>strawberry</b> guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E

Grey exists in one dam line, descending from mare Pelelaikka, especially through her maternal grandson E.V. Johtotähti 1726-93Ta, an award-winning working section stallion.

5|$|Although {{the gardens}} thrived {{in their early}} years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell <b>the</b> <b>Strawberry</b> Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to the gardens. Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him {{time to make a}} success of the gardens; {{by the end of the}} 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach the gardens.|$|E

5|$|The John Day River, a {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, flows generally west from <b>the</b> <b>Strawberry</b> Mountains before reaching the national monument. It turns sharply north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly, where the North Fork John Day River joins the main stem. Downstream of Kimberly, the river flows generally west to downstream of the unincorporated community of Twickenham, and generally north thereafter. Rock Creek enters the river {{at the north end of}} Picture Gorge. Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell, then north along the eastern edge of the Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day downstream of Twickenham. Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek, which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months after}} the single's release, the Smiths {{recorded}} the song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer Troy Tate. This version was recorded a tone lower than the original in the key of F# minor, and features a shorter introduction. The Smiths recorded the song again with producer John Porter in October at Manchester's Pluto Studios. Morrissey rejected {{this version of the}} song. Due to impending deadlines, the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album The Smiths was a remix of the original master recording from <b>the</b> <b>Strawberry</b> Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back in the mix, and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Strawberry</b> Panic! manga, {{written by}} Sakurako Kimino and {{illustrated}} by Namuchi Takumi, was serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with a new chapter released once a month. Two bound volumes {{have been published in}} Japan under MediaWorks' Dengeki Comics label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover. While the manga's story is unfinished, Strawberry Panic! has not made an appearance in Dengeki G's Magazine since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. Major differences between the anime and manga center around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō. The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until {{the latter part of the}} series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by Seven Seas Entertainment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Strawberries are non-climacteric fruits {{with a low}} {{respiration}} rate, but {{are subject}} to serious fungal deterioration during postharvest handling. The edible coatings based on chitosan (CH), quinoa protein-chitosan (Q/CH) and quinoa protein-chitosan-sunflower oil (Q/CH/SO) may provide {{a solution to this}} problem. Thus, in this work CH, Q/CH and Q/CH/SO were elaborated and applied to fresh strawberries, and its effect on <b>the</b> <b>strawberries</b> shelf life during storage for 15  d was evaluated by mold and yeast count, fungal decay, carbon dioxide rate, physicochemical properties, and sensory evaluation. Results: On all analysis days, <b>the</b> <b>strawberries</b> coated with <b>the</b> film-forming CH, Q/CH and Q/CH/SO solutions presented a significant lower amount of mold and yeast growth than <b>the</b> uncoated <b>strawberries.</b> Coated strawberries with Q/CH/SO decreased the CO 2 emission rate by 60 % compared to <b>the</b> uncoated <b>strawberries.</b> <b>The</b> color of <b>the</b> <b>strawberries</b> was not influenced by the films.
