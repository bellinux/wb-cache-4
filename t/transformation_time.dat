Yield stress increases in the whole range of <b>transformation</b> <b>time.</b> Fatigue limit is the mechanical characteristic relatively closely connected with the content of retained austenite: the higher its content, the higher fatigue limit. Optimal combination of tensile properties is obtained in rather narrow range of <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> from 40 to 60 minutes where the maximum of elongation to fracture is observed. The range of the highest values of fatigue limit is wider (10 to 100 minutes with fatigue limit of 260 to 270 MPa) because its dependence on <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> is weaker. This rather wide technological window means that ADI is structural material not very sensitive to keeping technological conditions and, therefore, its good fatigue properties can be obtained also in mass production or in plants with average level of technology...|$|E

The volume fraction of bainite increased from 0. 4 for the shortest bainitic <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> (30 minutes) to 0. 9 at the longest time (120 minutes). The above microstructures exhibited an extended elasto-plastic transition leading to very high initial work-hardening rates.

These measurements point to a substantial kinematic hardening due to the mechanical contrast between the microstructural constituents.

The effect of intercritical annealing temperature and isothermal bainitic transformation (IBT) time at 465 ï°C on mechanical properties and microstructure were determined. The best combination of strength and ductility was obtained for the lower intercritical annealing temperature of 750 Â°C for an isothermal bainitic <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> of 90 s at 465 Â°C. However, after intercritical annealing at a higher temperature of 797 Â°C, optimum mechanical properties were obtained for a shorter isothermal bainitic <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> of 60 s at 465 Â°C, likely due to the lower C content of the intercritical austenite bringing about faster transformation kinetics.

40|$|A simple {{monatomic}} {{system in}} two dimensions with a double-well interaction potential is investigated {{in a wide}} range of temperature by molecular dynamics simulation. The system is melted and equilibrated well above the melting temperature, and then it is quenched to a temperature 88 % below the melting temperature Tm at several cooling rates to produce an amorphous state. Various thermodynamic quantities are measured as a function of temperature while the system is heated at a constant rate. The glass transiton is observed by a sudden increase of the energy and Tg is shown to be an increasing function of the cooling rate in the preparation process of the amorphous state. In a relatively-high temperature region, the system gradually transforms into crystals, and the time-temperature-transformation(TTT) curve shows a typical nose shape.

40|$|Shape {{memory alloy}} actuatorsâ strokes can be {{increased}} {{at the expense of}} recovery force via heat treatment to form compressed springs in their heat-activated, austenitic state. Although there are models to explain their behaviour, few investigations present experimental results for support or validation. The aim of the present paper is to determine via experimentation how certain parameters affect a helical shape memory alloy actuatorâs outputs: its <b>transformation</b> <b>times</b> and stroke. These parameters include wire diameter, spring diameter, transition temperature, number of active turns, bias force and direct current magnitude. Six investigations were performed: one for each parameter manipulation. For repeatability and to observe thermo-mechanical training effects, the springs were cyclically activated. The resultant patterns were compared with results predicted from one-dimensional models to elucidate the findings. Generally, it was observed that the <b>transformation</b> <b>times</b> and strokes converged at changing stress levels; the convergence is likely the peak where the summation of elastic stroke and transformation stroke has reached its maximum. During cyclic loading, the actuatorsâ strokes decreased to a converged value, particularly at larger internal stresses; training should therefore be performed prior to the actuatorâs implementation for continual use applications...|$|R

40|$|An extensive, {{systematic}} {{molecular dynamics}} (MD) study is performed for analysing the nucleation, kinetics and morphology characteristics of thermally-induced, displacive phase transformations from face-centered cubic (fcc) to body-centered cubic (bcc) iron. At the atomic level these transformation characteristics {{are influenced by}} a number of factors, including (i) the appearance of free surfaces, (ii) the initial presence of fcc-bcc grain boundaries, (iii) the existence of point defects (i. e., atomic vacancies) near a grain boundary, (iv) the initial thermal velocities of the atoms, and (v) the specific interatomic potential used. Other MD studies that capture the overall transformation behaviour of iron well have often underestimated or ignored the influence by these factors on the transformation response, with the risk of putting the accuracy, generality and physical explanation of the MD results on loose grounds. The present research illustrates the relative contribution of each of the above factors by means of a detailed comparison study for three different interatomic potentials. The accuracy of the interatomic potentials is established by validating for the fcc and bcc phases the calculated elastic moduli, cohesive energy, vacancy formation energy and interfacial energy against experimental and ab initio data reported in the literature. The importance of calibrating material data of both the stable bcc phase and the metastable fcc phase - instead of the stable bcc phase only - is demonstrated. The numerical results call for general caution when interpreting phenomena that start close to instability points and therefore are sensitive to small disturbances; a large spread in the overall <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> is found under different initial thermal velocities, interfacial lattice incoherence, boundary conditions (free vs. periodic), and interatomic potentials, where for completely transformed atomic systems the discrepancy between the maximum and minimum <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> appears {{to be more than a}} factor of 150. The <b>transformation</b> <b>time</b> is phenomenologically related to the overall activation energy and the cohesive energy difference of the fcc and bcc phases, which, beyond a certain combination of values, may even prevent the transformation process from occurring. Also, the morphology of the bcc product phase is remarkably sensitive to the type of boundary conditions and the choice of interatomic potential, while the influence by both the set of initial thermal velocities and the interfacial lattice incoherence only becomes apparent for specific atomic samples that transform relatively slowly. The presence of fcc-bcc grain boundaries increases the spatial heterogeneity of transformation events, with the appearance of an increasing number of vacancies at the grain boundary giving rise to a larger overall <b>transformation</b> <b>time.</b> The 10 main results following from the present MD study are conveniently summarised at the end of this communication...|$|E
