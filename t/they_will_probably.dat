Homer and Marge had to cope with Bart, who was two years old at the time. Marge reveals to her husband and their son that she is pregnant again, and points out to Homer that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> need a bigger place. After viewing several unsuitable properties, they buy a house on Evergreen Terrace with a $15,000 down payment from the sale of Grampa's house.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{official}} guidelines {{yet on the}} use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially {{one of the most interesting}} oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile.|$|E

25|$|Fifteen years later, the Pevensie {{children}} have grown into {{young men and}} women. While chasing a white stag through the forest, they encounter the lamppost that Lucy saw on her first trip to Narnia. They make their way through trees, suddenly tumbling out of the wardrobe {{at the same time}} and day they left, becoming children again. Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe, but Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> return to Narnia when they least expect it.|$|E

During the battle, Cassius has his servant kill him after hearing of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Titinius, who was not really captured, sees Cassius's corpse, he commits suicide. However, Brutus wins that stage of the battle, but his victory is not conclusive. With a heavy heart, Brutus battles again the next day. He loses and commits suicide by running on his own sword, held for him by a loyal soldier.|$|E

U-181 rendezvoused with the supply ship Charlotte Schliemann east of Mauritius to refuel on 21 June. Also present were , {{under the command of}} Robert Gysae, [...] (Wilhelm Dommes), [...] (Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat), [...] (Robert Bartels) and [...] (Werner Hartmann). The commanders exchanged experiences and discussed the problem of torpedo failures. In July, Lüth led his boat west towards Madagascar, before being ordered back to Mauritius. [...] On 15 July 1943, Lüth sunk the British collier Empire Lake and noted in his logbook: [...] "Five men have been left floating on a piece of wreckage.

[...] Resnick named Mr. Show with Bob and David, The Kids in the Hall and the Upright Citizens Brigade as influences on the special. Dave Hughes, creator of the series Off the Air, who had discussed with the group about developing a series, took note of Resnick's sketch and helped the collective develop it into an infomercial. After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City. Resnick informed Network Awesome that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> not produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien {{is working with the}} network to create something that viewers will [...] "stumble on unintentionally." ...|$|E

The January 1988 Air Enthusiast magazine states: [...] "Both Cecil Steeves and Junius Harworth remember the Wrights; Steeves described them and recalled their telling Weisskopf that they had received his letter indicating an exchange of correspondence." [...] Steeves said that the Wright brothers, [...] "under the guise of offering to help finance his inventions, actually received inside information that aided them materially in completing their own plane." [...] Steeves related that Whitehead said to him, [...] "Now since I have given them the secrets of my invention <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never do anything in the way of financing me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite this success, Belisarius {{was well}} aware that his {{situation}} was still dangerous. He therefore {{wrote a letter to}} Justinian, asking for aid. Indeed, Justinian had already dispatched reinforcements under the tribunes Martinus and Valerian, but they had been delayed in Greece due to bad weather. In his letter, Belisarius also added cautionary words concerning the loyalty of the populace: [...] "And although at the present time the Romans are well disposed toward us, yet when their troubles are prolonged, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> not hesitate to choose the course which is better for their own interests. [...] Furthermore, the Romans will be compelled by hunger to do many things they would prefer not to do." [...] For fear of treason, extreme measures were taken by Belisarius: Pope Silverius was deposed on suspicions of negotiating with the Goths and replaced by Vigilius, the locks and keys of the gates were changed [...] "twice each month", the guards on gate duty regularly rotated, and patrols set up.|$|E
2500|$|Takenaga's unit {{were held}} in Aitape for around one month, before being broken up and sent to prison camps in Lae and in Australia, where they {{received}} good treatment. They were all interrogated, and in particular, Lieutenant Colonel Takenaga was transported to Manila for a detailed interrogation. As well as giving character information about the commanders of the 18th Army, Takenaga gave his opinion of how the Allies should deal with Emperor Hirohito: [...] "If the Emperor is killed then the Japanese people will resist until the bitter end, {{but if there is}} an order from the Emperor then <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> surrender peacefully." [...] In preparation for interrogation, the soldiers in Takenaga's unit had invented false personal and unit names before their surrender, but from documents seized in Wewak District the Australian Army recognised these as falsehoods. Some of the prisoners also helped with translation of seized documents and with propaganda broadcasts urging the Japanese Army to surrender.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the {{nomination}} was decided by delegates under the Democratic Party's rules, so the candidates campaigned {{to maximize their}} delegate advantage. If {{the nomination}} were decided by popular vote, they likely would have campaigned differently, in order to run up the vote in populous states like New York and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{has said that the}} popular vote should have no effect under the current rules: [...] "It’s a delegate race. The way the system works is that the delegates choose the nominee." [...] Obama's chief strategist suggested that the Clinton campaign's focus on the popular vote was a distraction tactic: [...] "When they started off, it was all about delegates.... Now that we have more delegates, it’s all about the popular vote. And if that does not work out, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> challenge us to a game of cribbage to choose the nominee." [...] Nevertheless, polls have shown that a plurality of Democrats think superdelegates should consider the popular vote when deciding which candidate to support.|$|E
