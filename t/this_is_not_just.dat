Since abbeys were usually self-sufficient, in practice this meant they ate a vegan diet.

25|$|Between the seventeenth-century and {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that {{had the effect of}} concentrating the light. This new type of lamp lit up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light to dazzle the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals.|$|E

But mostly, my children and my wife, who often had to endure my absence for long periods of time. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> for me, but for everyone involved in my career,” Morales said.< As reported on April 25, 2013 by badlefthook.com, Morales plans to fight two times in 2013 in July and November.

MusicOMH commented that [...] "Speed Of Sound, the lead single, has 'Clocks'-like drumming contrasts with synth sequences that remind more of Enya than rock music" [...] and criticised it for sounding [...] "familiar and far older than it is." [...] Pitchfork Media likewise criticised the song's [...] "uncanny resemblance to 'Clocks'" [...] and continued [...] "Certainly, it rarely hurts to stick with what works, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it." [...] The reviewer did, however, comment that [...] "the track's vocal melody outperforms the one from 'Clocks' by a hair." ...|$|E

500|$|In Croatia, HV units {{returning}} to their bases were given heroes' welcomes in numerous cities, and a commemorative medal was created to be issued to HV troops {{who took part in}} the operation. On 26 August, Croatia organised the Freedom Traina railroad tour taking Tuđman and the bulk of Croatia's government officials, public personalities, journalists and the diplomatic corps in Croatia from Zagreb to Karlovac, Gospić, Knin and Split. Tuđman gave a speech at each of the stops. In Knin, he declared: [...] " [...] didn't even have time to collect their dirty [...] and their dirty underwear. On this day, we can say that Croatia stopped bearing its historical cross. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the liberation of land, but the creation of a foundation for a free and independent Croatia for centuries to come."

500|$|The first {{suspected}} case in Asia was in 1997, {{though it was}} not until the fifth {{suspected case}} that the presence of the virus could be confirmed. This case was reported in 2006, with the death of a young wild-born female calf at an elephant sanctuary in Cambodia. The virus was identified as part of the EEHV1 group, the same as previously identified in the North American and European captive populations. In 2013, nine lethal cases from India were extensively characterized and found to consist of a wide variety of genetically diverged strains of EEHV1A and EEHV1B matching the subtypes and genetic range of nearly all those found previously in Europe and North America. Cases attributed to EEHV1A and EEHV4 have also been reported in Thailand and there is both confirmed and anecdotal evidence for similar hemorrhagic disease deaths of between 16 and 30 more calves in Asian countries including Thailand, India, Nepal, Myanmar and Indonesia within the past five years. Thus, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a disease of captive elephants, but is endogenous to and possibly rampant in Asian elephants in the wild also. Further research has been noted as [...] "urgently required" [...] to study the situation in regions with wild Asian elephant populations.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} titled the Wonder World Tour {{because of its}} {{diversity}} in themes and styles. Cyrus believed the tour was good transition for solidifying a more rock music-based career. She described the tour to be edgy and [...] "more of a mature show", with the target audience being teenagers relatively her age, which was sixteen at the time. However, performances that would please younger audiences {{were added to the}} setlist. It was conceptualized to be a more elaborate than Cyrus' previous tour and to reflect Cyrus as an individual. The reason for this to occur was because Cyrus felt more confident as a vocalist to perform stunts and use props while singing. Also, more resources were available, for more companies were willing to invest in the tour. Ideas were suggested by different individuals and were tested during filmed rehearsals in order to decide which would make the final cut. [...] "Each person has their own character and their own story. So, we've added everyone's kind of specialty into our show [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a concert, it is an absolute show", Cyrus said. After having completed filming for The Last Song (2010) in Tybee Island, Georgia, Cyrus returned to Los Angeles for tour rehearsals at The Forum in mid-August. Due to filming The Last Song, Cyrus was only able to rehearse for three weeks although the average rehearsal period for musicians is about three months.|$|E
50|$|Around 1900, {{as part of}} the {{heritage}} conservation movement (Heimatschutzbewegung), attempts were made to collect, preserve and promote examples of what was seen as Bergisch architecture. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> based on the rural farmhouse type, which also occurred in the villages in a smaller version, but also typical Bergisch buildings like Schleifkotten ("grinder's cottages"), Hammerkotten ("hammersmith's cottages") or the Bleicherhaus ("bleaching house").|$|R

2500|$|Coding in kernel can be challenging, in {{part because}} one cannot use common {{libraries}} (like a full-featured libc), and because one needs to use a source-level debugger like gdb.

2500|$|Thus, when [...] "trouble" [...] is {{detected}} in the inner loop, the CYCLE X1 (not X2) means that the skip will be to the next iteration for I, not J.

50|$|The castles of {{powerful}} feudal lords were often planned {{from the outset}} as Ganerbenburgs.

2500|$|It is {{analogous}} to the dual vector space of a vector space: a finite-dimensional vector space V and its dual vector space V* are not naturally isomorphic, but their endomorphism algebras (matrix algebras) are: [...] via the transpose.

2500|$|These new trends have a {{significant}} impact and a possible paradigm shift.

[...] However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> the home country, the responsibility of development resides in the hands of wealthy countries as well. To switch to a rights-based approach to development would then lead to using internationally agreed upon human rights as a responsibility of governments to provide. [...] Within this theory development will no longer be viewed as a gift or a need, but rather a right that states and governments are held accountable for.|$|E
2500|$|... "To all who {{received}} Him, He gave {{the power to}} become sons of God" [...] (Jn 1:12). For a Christian, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a way of speaking or calling. Awareness of divine filiation is rooted in a divine gift that transforms a person from within. St. John puts it this way: [...] "See what love the Father has for us, that He has called us sons of God, and so we are!...We are truly children of God" [...] (1 Jn 3:1–2). St. Josemaria concludes that [...] "whoever is unaware of this is unaware of his innermost truth;" [...] {{he has not yet}} discovered the deepest reality of his being, nor the meaning of his existence on this earth.|$|E
