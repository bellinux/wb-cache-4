5|$|Hambro {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1958 with the non-fiction book Frankrike ("France"), and released {{his first novel}} two years later. The novel, entitled De frafalnes klubb ("The Club of the Estranged"), was favourably commented upon by contemporary critics, but failed to arouse much subsequent interest from scholars. Hambro's reputation as a novelist rests more on his trilogy about the fictional character Nico Dietmeyer, deemed a Bildungsroman by academics. That work, serialised in the 1960s, was Hambro's first major commercial success, and has been reviewed in detail both by contemporaneous commentators and modern literary scholars. After a few unsuccessful novels in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hambro turned his writings towards non-fiction, especially focusing on linguistics and politics, fields of interest that he had inherited from his father, who became fascinated by Sanskrit and East Asian poetry during his philology studies. The younger Hambro's most well-known and successful book within linguistics was the 1969 <b>Ting,</b> tanke, tale ("Thing, Thought, Speech"), followed by Språket i funksjon ("Language in Operation") in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Present-day {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} Scots law before the eleventh century is largely speculative, with no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but it was probably a mixture of different legal traditions representing the different cultures inhabiting the land at the time, including British, Irish and Anglo-Saxon customs. The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I, set out a system of compensation for injury and death based on ranks and the solidarity of kin groups. There were popular courts, the comhdhail, indicated by dozens of place names throughout eastern Scotland. In Scandinavian-held areas Udal law formed the basis of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl, and the meetings were open to virtually all free men. At these sessions decisions were made, laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law <b>Ting</b> Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E
25|$|Tings {{were huge}} open-air events, which {{required}} plenty of space. The more important <b>ting</b> that king Olof talked about {{was probably the}} <b>Ting</b> of all Swedes, which {{was held at the}} end of February in Uppsala, during the Disting. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this <b>ting,</b> and the most powerful man at this assembly was not the king, but the lawspeaker of Tiundaland. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic <b>Ting</b> of all Geats in Skara and the Ostrogothic Lionga <b>ting</b> in the vicinity of today's Linköping.|$|E
