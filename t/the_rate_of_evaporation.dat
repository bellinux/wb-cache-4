5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation.</b> More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E

2500|$|Formerly one of {{the four}} largest lakes in the world with an area of , the Aral Sea has been {{shrinking}} since at least 1850, although with some interruptions.

Shrinking has accelerated since the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects. By 1997, it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into four lakes– the North Aral Sea, the eastern and western basins of the once far larger South Aral Sea, and one smaller intermediate lake. By 2009, the southeastern lake had disappeared and the southwestern lake had retreated to a thin strip at {{the western edge of the}} former southern sea; in subsequent years, occasional water flows have led to the southeastern lake sometimes being replenished to a small degree. Satellite images taken by NASA in August 2014 revealed that for the first time in modern history the eastern basin of the Aral Sea had completely dried up.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the retention of solvents within experimental HEMA/solvent primers after two conditions for solvent evaporation: from a free surface or from dentine surface. Methods: Experimental primers were prepared by mixing 35 % HEMA with 65 % water, methanol, ethanol or acetone (v/v). Aliquots of each primer (50 mu l) were placed on glass wells or they were applied {{to the surface of}} acid-etched dentine cubes (2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm) (n = 5). For both conditions (i. e. from free surface or dentine cubes), change in primers mass due to solvent evaporation was gravimetrically measured for 10 min at 51 % RH and 21 degrees C. <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solvent <b>evaporation</b> was calculated as a function of loss of primers mass (%) over time. Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls (p < 0. 05). Results: There were significant differences between solvent retention(%) and evaporation rate (%/min) depending on the solvent present in the primer and the condition for evaporation (from free surface or dentine cubes) (p < 0. 05). For both conditions, the greatest amount of retained solvent was observed for HEMA/water primer. <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solvent <b>evaporation</b> for HEMA/acetone primer was almost 2 - to 10 -times higher than for HEMA/water primer depending whether evaporation occurred, respectively, from a free surface or dentine cubes. <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solvent <b>evaporation</b> varied with time, being in general highest at the earliest periods. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> solvent <b>evaporation</b> and its retention into HEMA/solvent primers was influenced by the type of the solvent and condition allowed for their evaporation.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} regarding water storage in Australia, and other semi-arid countries, is <b>the</b> high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> that inevitably leads to significant water loss. In this paper, the use of air-bubble plume systems to reduce evaporation from large reservoirs is assessed. A destratification system was designed for a large dam based on its depth and stratification strength {{with the intention of}} destratifying the reservoir in a short time period. The model DYRESM was then used to simulate the water dynamics under destratification conditions. Different strategies for the operation of the aeration system were assessed, from 10 -days operation periods at times <b>of</b> high <b>evaporation</b> <b>rates</b> to continuous operation over longer time spans. The modelled water column temperatures and evaporation rates were analysed and it was found that artificial destratification was only effective in reducing evaporation in spring. In summer, heat is added to the water at a rapid rate, and artificial destratification only helps reduce evaporation in the initial days of operation. The effect of artificial destratification in reducing evaporation in autumn depends on the operation of the system during summer. If operated in summer, <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> in autumn will increase due to the additional heat added to the water during the summer. In winter, overturn takes place and artificial destratification has no influence on water temperatures and evaporation. It was concluded that aeration by air-bubble plumes would only be effective in reducing evaporation if the hypolimnetic water does not become warm when mixing takes place.
