500|$|When viewing Rule 184 as a <b>traffic</b> <b>model,</b> it {{is natural}} to {{consider}} the average speed of the vehicles.

Macroscopic models consider the aggregate behavior of traffic flow while microscopic models consider {{the interaction of}} individual vehicles.

Mesoscopic models share the properties of macroscopic and microscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>models.</b> These models characterize the influence of vehicles in close proximity and then approximate the cumulative temporal and spatial traffic behavior [3].

Due to the inability of traditional <b>traffic</b> <b>models</b> to capture these long-range dependencies, new network <b>traffic</b> <b>models</b> were developed {{that are able to}} capture it. In this paper we compare three self-similar long-range dependent <b>traffic</b> <b>models,</b> namely the FARIMA model, the wavelet independent Gaussian model and the multifractal wavelet model. We present results on their marginal distributions, their correlation matching to real traffic and their queuing behaviour.

40|$|In Model Predictive Control (MPC) for <b>traffic</b> networks, <b>traffic</b> <b>models</b> {{are crucial}} {{since they are}} used as {{prediction}} models for determining the optimal control actions. In {{order to reduce the}} computational complexity of MPC for traffic networks, macroscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>models</b> are often used instead of microscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>models.</b> These macroscopic <b>traffic</b> <b>models</b> can be divided into homogeneous, single-class models and heterogeneous, multi-class models. In general, multi-class models are more accurate than single-class models, without increasing the computational complexity significantly. In MPC a more accurate model in general implies a better prediction of the controlled system, providing the controller more accurate information for determining the control actions. Therefore, developing and using multi-class <b>traffic</b> <b>models</b> is one way to improve the effectiveness of MPC. Apart from the above characteristics of <b>traffic</b> <b>models,</b> other factors such as uncertainties in external inputs and model parameters can also affect the accuracy of predictions. Thus another way for improving the effectiveness of MPC is {{to take into account the}} effects of these uncertainties and to develop robust MPC approaches for handling these uncertainties. Apart from improving the effectiveness of MPC, making MPC feasible for large-scale traffic networks is also important, due to the rapid increase of the computational complexity of the MPC optimization problem with the size of the controlled system. For large-scale systems, Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) is often considered for making the control approach computationally feasible. Moreover, robust DMPC can be developed for ensuring both feasibility and robustness. Hybrid and Distributed Systems and Contro...|$|R
