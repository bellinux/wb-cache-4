5|$|An amateur, near shot-for-shot remake {{was made}} by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb, then {{children}} in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of the film, called , it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, where it was discovered by Eli Roth and acclaimed by Spielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> work and said {{he looked forward to}} seeing their names on the big screen. Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures purchased the trio's life rights with the goal of producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.|$|E
5|$|During Mao's rule (1949â€“1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their manual labor for farming and for urban industrialization. To {{compensate}} for <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> work, they were provided {{access to education}} and politics. The Chinese government supported women's education. The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that had real decision-making power.|$|E

The Government of Nova Scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 Canadian Forces personnel to assist local authorities in HRM with cleanup in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration. Many utility workers, especially those employed by Nova Scotia Power and the dozens of crews from Maritime Electric and NB Power who responded under mutual assistance agreements, worked for almost threeweeks without any considerable amount of rest. Many residents praised utility crews for <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> work in restoring the extensive damage.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), {{which are all}} within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{years of}} the 1980s saw a number of changes in {{personnel}} and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began {{to return to a}} hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar {{was one of the first}} women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E

5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15â€“36 months and males at 4â€“5 years. Mating may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> horns are used. It is 2â€“4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.|$|E
5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
50|$|Research by Vaugh (1999) {{looked at}} the effects of {{uncertainty}} {{on the use of}} the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would ask the students to complete the questionnaire. Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in <b>their</b> easiest and <b>hardest</b> classes. Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about <b>their</b> <b>hardest</b> final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grade at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results indicated that students used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about <b>their</b> <b>hardest</b> final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on <b>their</b> <b>hardest</b> final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on <b>their</b> <b>hardest</b> final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic.|$|R

Additionally, some established hard rock bands of the era such as the Scorpions, Whitesnake, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Judas Priest began incorporating glam metal elements into their sounds and images, as the genre's popularity skyrocketed in 1985-86.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive.

5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into <b>their</b> <b>hard</b> shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E
