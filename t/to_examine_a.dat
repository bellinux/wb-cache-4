5|$|In 1874 and 1875, Alexander was {{assigned}} to a board examining the problem of keeping the Mississippi River Delta from silting up and becoming an impediment to ship traffic. During {{the course of his}} tenure on the board, he traveled to Europe in order to examine European solutions to the problem. At the end of 1875, Alexander was asked by the state government of California <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> proposed irrigation project in the San Joaquin Valley. Busy with other projects, Alexander appointed an associate, William Hammond Hall, to head the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they looked at the defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus {{began his}} {{expedition}} from Uppsala on May 12, 1732, {{just before he}} turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a {{main part of the}} diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.|$|E

He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|On Mardi Gras in New Orleans, {{the ferry}} Sen. Alvin T. Stumpf is {{carrying}} hundreds of U.S. Navy sailors {{and their families}} across the Mississippi River from their base to the city. Suddenly, the ferry explodes and sinks, killing 543 passengers and crew members. Special Agent Douglas Carlin (Denzel Washington) from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and FBI Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Raised to {{temporary}} air commodore, Goble {{took over}} as CAS {{for the second time}} between December 1932 and June 1934, while Williams attended the Imperial Defence College in London. On secondment to the RAF from 1935 to 1937, Goble was attached to the British Air Ministry as Deputy Director of Air Operations. In this capacity he attended a conference in 1936 <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> Commonwealth-wide air training plan, a concept that would be revived in World War II as the Empire Air Training Scheme. Continuing his exchange posting, on 1 September Goble {{took over as}} Air Officer Commanding No. 2 (Bomber) Group, based in Hampshire. The group comprised fifteen squadrons, putting him in charge of a force stronger than the entire RAAF. On 28 February 1937, Goble was raised to temporary air vice marshal. He succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time in February 1939, when the latter was dismissed from his position {{in the aftermath of the}} Ellington Report criticising the standards of training and air safety observed by the RAAF. When he replaced Williams, Goble was Air Member for Personnel and might therefore have been considered more closely responsible for such standards; he maintained that Williams had personally overseen the service's air training since 1934.|$|E

30|$|Secondly, not all {{articles}} state intent <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>an</b> {{intervention in}} an elderly population in their objective. The objective is often quite broad and such studies can draw conclusions regarding elderly patients from results that have performed sub-group analysis on different age groups. Although {{many of these}} studies were excluded from our analysis, {{it is unlikely that}} such studies would have different representative definitions of age by chronology. Furthermore, by only evaluating studies that stated <b>an</b> intention <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>an</b> elderly population in their objective, there is increased focus on definitions that should be more robustly agreed by the authorship.|$|R

5|$|Stephen became {{increasingly}} concerned with ensuring {{that his son}} Eustace would inherit his throne. The King tried to convince the Church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim; Pope Eugene III refused, and Stephen {{found himself in a}} sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy. In 1153 the Empress's son, Henry FitzEmpress, invaded England and built an alliance of powerful regional barons to support his claim for the throne. The two armies met at Wallingford, but neither side's barons were keen to fight another pitched battle. Stephen began <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> negotiated peace, a process hastened by the sudden death of Eustace. Later in the year Stephen and Henry agreed to the Treaty of Winchester, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over William, Stephen's second son. Stephen died the following year. Modern historians have extensively debated the extent to which Stephen's personality, external events, or the weaknesses in the Norman state contributed to this prolonged period of civil war.|$|E
5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{and modern}} historians have viewed the {{creation}} of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali. Khaled Fahmy argues against this view. Fahmy states that, because the reasons for {{the creation of}} the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals. For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, {{as well as in the}} cases where a hakima was used <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|E

Cyril went into exile, but was restored to his church within two years by a decision of the Council of Seleucia. However, the credit enjoyed by Acacius with the emperor Constantius II was able to undo Cyril of Jerusalem's restoration, and, in 360, Cyril was condemned once more, this time by the Synod of Constantinople.
