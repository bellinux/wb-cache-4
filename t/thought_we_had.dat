As big as that song is getting for us right now, it was {{definitely}} a song that we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to have in the show. She cut a thing for us to use, and I cut a thing for her to use in her show if she wants to do that. It's a cool way to have her be a part of the show even though she's not going to be there every night." ...|$|E
500|$|... 2001 earned Stanley Kubrick an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, {{as well as}} {{nominations}} for Best Director and Original Screenplay (shared with Arthur C. Clarke). Anthony Masters was also nominated for Best Art Direction. An honorary award was made to John Chambers in that year for his make-up work on Planet of the Apes, and Clarke reports that he [...] "wondered, as loudly as possible, whether the judges had passed over 2001 because they <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> used real ape-men". The film won four Baftas, for Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Track and as Best Road Show, and was a nominee in the Best Film category.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{receiving}} {{of the news}} that democracy has come to Iraq, one scene shows a man having a knife held to his throat, which caused some controversy after the episode was broadcast. Stewie also knowingly breaks the fourth wall in the episode, by speaking in a manner {{as if he were}} talking to the audience. In one scene, Stewie mentions the time [...] "Peter went after that hockey coach" [...] (making a veiled reference to [...] "Hockey Dad" [...] Thomas Junta), in the expectation of a cutaway gag. However, nothing happens, and Stewie comments, [...] "Oh, no clip? <b>Thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a clip". This scene was described as being a one off.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Aquaman {{stemmed from a}} fifth season episode of Smallville, [...] "Aqua". The episode {{featured}} Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. [...] "Aqua" [...] became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, {{but it was never}} meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said," [...] was the first idea where we really <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a franchise where we could see 100 episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The album did not chart {{as well in}} the United States as its predecessor, peaking {{at number}} 148 on the Billboard 200. It was, however, the band's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number 45. Many of the songs on Leave Home were not {{considered}} by Mickey Leigh to be [...] "radio–friendly" [...] because [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was about Intoxicative inhalant. Joey relates: [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a lotta songs that should've been hits. If you grew up in the sixties, things would just get played and be hits right off the bat. So we thought since our music was doin' something unique that everyone would pick up on that. What really happened was we were so alien that no one wanted to touch us. And so we wouldn't get played" ...|$|E

500|$|Following the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which {{commentators}} such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One {{correspondent for}} The Guardian Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: [...] "We got our numbers wrong. We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres {{and come back}} out in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place." [...] Indeed, {{more than half of}} the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.|$|E
500|$|The Oxford University Boat Club {{president}} and stroke Matthew Smith said [...] "It feels fantastic and I {{think it will}} take a while to top this feeling". [...] He went on to say: [...] "We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad... but I have such respect for Cambridge... with a lighter crew we've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history." [...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I just wish I could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} second, said [...] "Hats off to Mike (Ford, crew chief) {{and this whole}} FedEx Office Camry team. We {{have a really good}} car, we just had to learn to stay in the pits. We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1894 season, Parrott was {{converted}} to a second baseman, making way for Charlie Irwin at third base. Manager Cap Anson was criticized by The Sporting Life for continuing to play Parrott. The publication stated, [...] "It is true that [...] holds Parrot in high esteem and insists that 'Jiggs' is a great infielder, hence a suffering public may confidently expect to witness still further attempts of 'Jiggs' to hold down the second base bag." [...] On the season, Parrott batted [...]248 with 82 runs scored, 130 hits, 17 doubles, nine triples, three home runs, 65 RBIs, and 30 stolen bases in 126 games played. In 1895, Anson signed a new second baseman, Ace Stewart from Sioux City, Iowa, which demoted Parrott to the role of utility player. Anson responded to the criticism he had been taking for keeping Parrott by stating, [...] "I realize that 'Jiggs' is not popular with the Chicago crowds, so we will play him in games abroad only." [...] However, The Sporting Life responded by saying, [...] "The local scribes and fans <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> buried the lanky 'Jigglets,' so far as Chicago was concerned, but he bobs up serenely." [...] Parrott's final MLB game came on June 6, 1895. He played just three games with Chicago that season. In those games, he batted [...]250 with one hit in four at-bats. He was released early in the season.|$|E
500|$|In {{interviews}} {{after the}} race, Kanaan credited his team's fuel strategy {{for being the}} main factor in his victory. During many of the laps that Wheldon led, Kanaan drafted behind him to use less gasoline than normal, {{and he was able}} to stay on the track longer than other drivers as a result. He said of the strategy, [...] "that's what probably gave me the win." [...] On the other hand, Wheldon later said that his radio problem forced more [...] "conservative" [...] pit stop planning by himself and his team. Third-place finisher Franchitti said: [...] "We had to take the gamble to try to get the win. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> as good a car as TK (Tony Kanaan) and Dan (Wheldon). I think I could have hung with them, but I don't think I could have caught up with them." [...] Matsuura admitted his first-lap accident was his fault and apologized to his Japanese fans. After his accident on the 135th lap, Andretti was taken to the track's infield care center for a precautionary X-ray scan of his right shoulder which showed a negative result. He said that he struggled with controlling his car but was happy. With his second-place finish, Wheldon gained the season points lead with 188, three ahead of Kanaan and 17 in front of Dixon. The standings were closely contested, with the top six drivers separated by 27 points.|$|E

2500|$|When it {{was first}} {{introduced}} by the NBA, the 24-second shot clock made players so nervous that it hardly came into play, as players were taking fewer than 20 seconds to shoot. According to Syracuse star Dolph Schayes, [...] "We <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to take quick shots – a pass and a shot was it – maybe 8–10 seconds... But as the game went on, we saw the inherent genius in Danny's 24 seconds – you could work the ball around [...] for a good shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|With 3:35 left to play, Iowa {{attempted}} a trick play – an attempted flanker pass that has posed problems for Texas all season. [...] Safety Marcus Griffin stuffed the play for an 11-yard loss. [...] Commenting on stopping the trick play, Griffin said, [...] "I {{knew it was}} coming – we'd been beaten by that play in the last 10 games. We knew it had to come, I guess that was the best time for it." [...] Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz described the call as [...] "totally my fault. I was being greedy, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a secure play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{football}} matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005 a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa and forced fans to either stand out {{in the parking lot}} and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum.
