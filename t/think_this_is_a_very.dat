The Culture secretary Jeremy Hunt has stated that the Government does not intend to introduce a privacy law and that it would instead look towards clearer guidelines for judges ruling on injunctions. This was reaffirmed by David Cameron on 10 May 2011 when he blamed lack of parliamentary guidance forcing judges to rely on strict European law in their judgements. A spokesman for the Prime Minister welcomed the Neuberger report, stating that [...] "We <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> useful report and it is something we will be considering very carefully."

5000|$|In {{his book}} Tell Me How You Love The Picture: A Hollywood Life (2005), Feldman {{recalled}} the film's difficulties securing a distributor. He accused Hollywood powerbroker Michael Ovitz - whose Creative Artists Agency had represented Belushi, {{as well as}} Aykroyd and Murray - of using his influence to sabotage the production and distribution of Wired. Ovitz himself claimed that [...] "The film will rise or fall based on its own merits... We {{have nothing to do}} with the movie." [...] Some studio executives claimed that their reluctance to distribute Wired was due to the film's dubious quality, rather than its subject matter. Brillstein accused the filmmakers of generating the controversy around the film themselves, in an attempt to improve its commercial prospects: [...] "The only thing that the producers have to hang on to is the image of Wired as [...] "the movie that Hollywood tried to stop"... I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good plan to get some excitement for the movie."

Mumy noted: [...] "I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> big reason for the way it went—they’d get us done {{in a couple of}} takes. Nobody screwed up.

5000|$|On 1 April 2013 it was {{announced}} by E! Online that American singer Beyoncé would cover the song with André 3000 for The Great Gatsby soundtrack, set to be released on 7 May 2013. Baz Luhrmann, {{the director of the}} film, revealed that [...] "Back to Black" [...] was the final song to be included on the album. The inclusion of the song on the soundtrack was suggested by Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay Z, who also served as its executive producer. [...] "We were looking for, 'How do we have a darker moment?' and he said have a listen to this and he played it", commented Luhrmann who, after a few spins, confirmed it should appear on the album. Anton Monsted who served as a producer for the soundtrack, also talked about the placement of the cover of [...] "Back to Black" [...] on the track listing during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter:We have to thank Jay Z for bringing this into the overall thinking. He worked with us on the second party in the movie. The first party is a gaudy, rich, Venus flytrap of a celebration designed to attract Daisy's interest by physically bringing the entire city of New York to Long Island. The second party is one that Daisy does attend, but {{at this point in the}} story, we were looking for a musical direction that alluded to darker things beneath the surface. We were looking for a song that would speak to the almost 'Sid and Nancy' addictive love that Gatsby and Daisy have found themselves re-engaging in. Everybody knows the Amy Winehouse version of this song, and I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> interesting interpretation. It plunges you further into this particular kind of lovesickness. I think it works very well in the film, where it blends between a jazz recording that The Bryan Ferry Orchestra did and the version on the album with Beyoncé and André 3000. That combination helps to deepen the resonance of what the song is telling us.|$|E

30|$|However, {{visitors}} {{are not allowed}} to make permanent visits at once, because their identity tokens are valid for a period of time, which reduces the likelihood of identity tokens being stolen and provides secure access. In addition, it is impossible to get the plaintext information through the decryption of the convergence key, especially in our second scheme, in which an attacker may obtain a convergence key in two aspects. The first is that it is extremely difficult for an attacker to obtain a user’s private key and decrypt it directly to obtain a convergence key. Because the private key protection is more rigorous, and in the second scenario, we put the private key more closely on the private cloud, so we think {{that it is impossible to}} crack the convergence key by obtaining the private key. The second aspect is that the attacker uses a hash collision to directly brute force the convergence key. First of all, considering the unknowns of the hash function plus the possibility of a function collision, we <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low probability method. Moreover, medical data based on extraordinarily complex data types in the absence of clear text, the likelihood of a hash collision is almost non-existent, and in the second scenario, our convergence key is generated by two hash functions, which makes it possible, regardless of whether or not some of the plaintext information is available. It is not feasible to directly guess the convergence key. A third type of attacker is an illegal visitor who has some plaintext information and wants to access the entire information of the file by obtaining an access pointer.|$|E
40|$|The {{stage is}} a place where {{symbolic}} space and real space, symbolic time and real time are superimposed. The critical part of our thought process entitled La figure du chansonnier: resurgence du sujet, tries to examine the way singers (Gilles Vigneault as it happens) create a symbolic place where the risk of fusion between reality and symbolism is much lesser than in other art forms: therefore it is possible not to dissociate the singer as shown to the public and the I that both mark out and cover his work. We <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> soft way to work the stage, that values the union between the subject and his message. On the other hand, theater through all its conventions more clearly defines the fusion between reality and symbolism and the risk involved with such an enterprise. Maybe the actor who is both symbolically and literally under the lights is in much greater danger than the singer of being irreconcilably and without an end exposed to that fusion of reality and symbolism. We think that art, which probably consists of creating a symbolic distancing, gets its greatest strength when its second will is in motion: achieving symbolism and then coming back to reality transformed (for the better). What interested us all through Marie-la-putain, the play which constitutes the creation part of our thesis is to investigate the grey zone where through the spotlight there is no going back to reality: we don't go back to reality, or if we do, it is with great difficulty. All through the play the heroine will on stage try to sacrifice a part of her she would not normally have. The creation part, through Marie, is in fact the opposite of the critical part: it examines the stage as a place that allows disappropriation and dissolution...|$|E
