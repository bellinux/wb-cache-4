5|$|On June 24, 1832, {{a supply}} wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon. Around this time, Black Hawk and his 200-man war party also {{en route to}} the fort, had {{gathered}} at a gap in Terrapin Ridge. Black Hawk's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire. At around 4 p.m. four couriers from Galena bound for the army camp at Dixon's Ferry arrived at the fort.

5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got <b>their</b> <b>news</b> through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2001, in The New York Times 150th anniversary issue, former {{executive}} editor Max Frankel wrote that {{before and during}} World War II, the NY Times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in <b>their</b> <b>news</b> pages. Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, concluded that the newspaper had downplayed the Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth {{in part to the}} complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.|$|E

5|$|TRT-Children is {{the only}} TRT {{television}} station based in Istanbul. Istanbul {{is home to the}} headquarters of several Turkish stations and regional headquarters of international media outlets. Istanbul-based Star TV was the first private television network to be established following the end of the TRT monopoly; Star TV and Show TV (also based in Istanbul) remain highly popular throughout the country, airing Turkish and American series. Kanal D and ATV are other stations in Istanbul that offer a mix of news and series; NTV (partnered with U.S. media outlet MSNBC) and Sky Turk—both based in the city—are mainly just known for <b>their</b> <b>news</b> coverage in Turkish. The BBC has a regional office in Istanbul, assisting its Turkish-language news operations, and the American news channel CNN established the Turkish-language CNN Türk there in 1999. The Istanbul-based business and entertainment channel CNBC-e began broadcasting in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} partnered {{through a}} sharing agreement may also consolidate their programming operations: local newscasts on the junior {{partner in the}} LMA, if it operated a separate news department before the LMA's formation, may be rescheduled or scaled back to prevent direct competition with newscasts airing on the station acting as the senior partner (the latter aspect is less common with LMAs involving only stations affiliated {{with one of the}} three largest broadcast television networks). The stations may share news-gathering resources, but maintain separate news telecasts that are differentiated by their on-air presentation, anchors, and overall format, with varying degrees of autonomy; in these cases, a seemingly separate newscast on the brokered station in the duopoly may ultimately consist of repackaged news content from the other station. Alternatively, the stations may consolidate <b>their</b> <b>news</b> programming under a single joint brand.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, WVEC began {{broadcasting}} their newscast {{in digital}} widescreen, {{but because it}} was not completely high definition, it led rivals WAVY-TV, WVBT and WTKR to broadcast <b>their</b> <b>news</b> in high definition as opposed to WVEC's digital widescreen.

25|$|An {{estimated}} 1.4 {{million people}} lost power following the quake, mainly due to damaged electrical substations. Many San Francisco {{radio and television}} stations were temporarily knocked off the air. KRON-TV was off the air for about half an hour, while KGO-AM was off the air for about 40 minutes. About an hour and 40 minutes after the quake, KTVU resumed broadcasting, with <b>their</b> <b>news</b> anchors reporting from the station's parking lot. KCBS-AM switched immediately to backup power and managed to stay on air despite a subsequent generator failure. KCBS later won a Peabody Award for <b>their</b> <b>news</b> coverage, as did KGO-TV. Power was restored to most of San Francisco by midnight, and all but 12,000 customers had their power restored within two days.|$|E

25|$|But on July 11, 1966, CBS preempted Password {{in favor}} of CBS News' live {{coverage}} of a press conference held by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara {{on the progress of}} the Vietnam War. Because the other two networks did not grant <b>their</b> <b>news</b> divisions anywhere near the power that CBS did in making programming decisions, they went ahead with their regular schedules instead of the conference. A new show beginning that day on ABC—The Newlywed Game—caused some frustrated Password fans to begin defecting immediately; NBC also benefited from the CBS programming decision, experiencing success with their recently launched soap opera Days of Our Lives.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to former Fox stations on UHF {{that are now}} CBS, ABC or NBC stations—which often have had little to no success against their better-established news competitors, resulting in some stations even shutting down <b>their</b> <b>news</b> departments outright—KEYE's news department has made a very good account of itself in the two decades since the switch. It has benefited from CBS pouring significant resources into the news department when the network owned the station. Since {{the turn of the}} century, KEYE {{has been one of the}} fastest-growing stations in central Texas.
