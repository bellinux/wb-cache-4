5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the {{population}} of Weston-super-Mare is 76,143. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> it the largest settlement in North Somerset, which has a total population of 188,564. 20.1% of the town's population are aged 65 or over, compared with {{the national average of}} 16.5%.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E

5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15–16 mya. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> Apeomyoides the {{youngest}} known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps close {{a gap in the}} known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in Nevada and Arikareeomys in Nebraska. Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} affects between 5% and 66% of people, {{with about}} 20% {{of individuals in}} most populations having the condition to some degree. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> it the most common disease of the oral mucosa.

5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E
5|$|Despite its low {{death toll}} and low damage, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Alma {{from the list}} of Pacific {{hurricane}} names and replaced it with Amanda for the 2014 Pacific hurricane season. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> Alma the first tropical storm to be retired in the Eastern Pacific since Hazel in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Finely divided {{metallic}} osmium is pyrophoric and {{reacts with}} oxygen at room temperature, forming volatile osmium tetroxide. Some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> osmium tetroxide {{the main source}} of contact with the environment.|$|E

5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.|$|E
5|$|However, a Portia takes a {{relatively}} {{long time to}} see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs and mantises, which a Portia often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not {{consent to}} lend {{his name to}} a relator action. This matter lies entirely within his discretion, and his {{decision}} is not considered reviewable by the courts. In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his consent to an action against the Government. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> a relator action an uncertain, and hence an unsatisfactory, means of obtaining relief.|$|E
50|$|The {{language}} {{also allows}} the evaluation (execution) of code sections {{in order to}} produce the results for example or output images. <b>This</b> <b>make</b> it possible to accurately generate code sections that contain accurate results.|$|R
