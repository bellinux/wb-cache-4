30|$|Header {{compression}} is {{a complementary}} scheme related to aggregation [5, 17]. <b>The</b> usage for <b>header</b> compression {{is motivated by}} the fact that (1) the VoIP payload is typically compressed at the application layer, which means another compression does not help reduce the payload size; (2) <b>the</b> <b>headers</b> occupies {{a large portion of the}} packet; and (3) <b>the</b> <b>headers</b> have significant redundancy.|$|R
50|$|The unfragmentable part of {{a packet}} {{consists}} of <b>the</b> fixed <b>header</b> and some of <b>the</b> extension <b>headers</b> of <b>the</b> original packet (if present): all extension headers {{up to and including}} <b>the</b> Routing extension <b>header,</b> or else <b>the</b> Hop-by-Hop extension <b>header.</b> If neither extension <b>headers</b> are present, <b>the</b> unfragmentable part is just <b>the</b> fixed <b>header.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{source address}} {{is the one}} in <b>the</b> IPv6 <b>header.</b> <b>The</b> {{destination}} address is the final destination; if the IPv6 packet does not contain a Routing header, {{that will be the}} destination address in the IPv6 header; otherwise, at the originating node, it will be the address in the last element of <b>the</b> Routing <b>header,</b> and, at <b>the</b> receiving node, it will be the destination address in <b>the</b> IPv6 <b>header.</b> <b>The</b> value of <b>the</b> Next <b>Header</b> field is <b>the</b> protocol value for UDP: 17.

5|$|The {{beginning}} of the match was dominated by St Johnstone and after 13 minutes they were awarded a penalty kick by referee Eddie Smith when Dunfermline midfielder Stephen Simmons collided with St Johnstone's Steven Anderson in the penalty area. Paul Sheerin took the penalty kick and scored beyond Dunfermline's goalkeeper, Paul Gallacher, by hitting {{the ball into the}} bottom-left corner of the goal to score his seventh penalty of the season. Just several minutes after the first goal St Johnstone had an opportunity to score again when Kenny Deuchar had an attempt on goal after a pass from Rocco Quinn; <b>the</b> <b>header</b> beat goalkeeper Gallacher but went just wide of the goalpost. In the 19th minute, however, St Johnstone did score their second goal when Peter MacDonald struck a left-footed volley from 12 yards out which Dunfermline's goalkeeper Gallacher failed to stop. St Johnstone's early dominance coupled with Dunfermline's poor defending resulted in St Johnstone scoring a third goal after only 30 minutes; forward Andy Jackson passed the ball to Derek McInnes who then played the ball to Deuchar who moved past defender Sol Bamba in the penalty area and scored past the opposing goalkeeper from eight yards out to make it 3–0. Four minutes after the third goal, Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny made the first substitution of the match, replacing defender Calum Woods with Darren Young. In the 37th minute, shortly after the substitution, Dunfermline scored when Scott Wilson's header beat St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Main. Dunfermline's form changed for the better after their first goal and they almost scored again just before half time when substitute Young's goal-attempt rebounded off the goalpost.|$|E

25|$|Some {{examples}} of Flemish bond incorporate stretchers of one colour and headers of another.

Some of <b>the</b> <b>header</b> faces are exposed to wood smoke, generating a grey-blue colour, while other simply vitrified until they reach a deeper blue colour. Some headers have a glazed face, caused by using salt in the firing. Sometimes Staffordshire Blue bricks are used for the heading bricks.|$|E
