25|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of the Protestants, the Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Marian images, but in a different manner and with a different emphasis from <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>tradition.</b> While statues of the Virgin Mary abound in Catholic churches, there are specific prohibitions against all three-dimensional representations (of Mary or any other any saints) within the Orthodox Church, for they are regarded as remnants of pagan idolatry. Hence the Orthodox only produce and venerate two-dimensional images.|$|E
25|$|Within <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>tradition,</b> {{communal}} monasticism {{was established}} by Saint Benedict at Monte Cassino around 529.

The most influential orders during that period were the Benedictines, the Cluniacs founded at Cluny in 910, and then the Cistercians founded in 1098. Bernard of Clairvaux entered the Cistercian Order in 1113 and, as its leader, founded more than five hundred monasteries of austere design and often in remote locations.|$|E

While the Catholic Church supports Christian meditation as beneficial in knowing Christ, in the letter Aspects of Christian meditation it specifically warned against using non-Christian (e.g. modified Buddhist) styles of meditations as an attempt to know Christ.|$|E

25|$|In {{his role}} as the {{representative}} of Catholics in the United States, Carroll often wrote articles for publications defending <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>tradition</b> against persons who promoted anti-Catholicism in the United States. He fought notions of state establishment of Protestantism as the official religion, but he always treated non-Catholics with respect. He insisted that Catholics and Protestants should work together to build up the new nation. An early advocate of Christian unity, Carroll suggested that the chief obstacles to unity among Christians in the United States were the lack of clarity on the boundaries of papal primacy and the use of Latin in the liturgy.|$|E
25|$|The Hail Mary, also {{commonly}} called the Ave Maria (Latin) or Angelic Salutation, {{is a traditional}} Catholic prayer asking for the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. In Roman Catholicism, the prayer forms {{the basis of the}} Rosary and the Angelus prayers. In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies, both in Greek and in translations. It is also used by many other groups within <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>tradition</b> of Christianity including Anglicans, Independent Catholics, and Old Catholics. Some Protestant denominations, such as Lutherans, also make use of a form of the prayer.|$|E
500|$|While Catholics are {{sometimes}} accused of worshiping images, {{in violation of}} the first commandment, the Church says this is a misunderstanding. In the Church's opinion, [...] "the honor paid to sacred images is a 'respectful veneration', not the adoration due to God alone". In the 8th century, heated arguments arose over whether religious icons (in this context paintings) were prohibited by the first commandment. The dispute was almost entirely restricted to the Eastern church; the iconoclasts wished to prohibit icons, while the iconodules supported their veneration, a position consistently backed by the Western Church. [...] At the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, the ecumenical council determined that the veneration of icons and statues was not {{in violation of the}} commandment and stated [...] "whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it." [...] At {{around the time of the}} controversy over Iconoclasm, the Western church began to use monumental sculpture, which by the Romanesque period became a major feature of Western Christian art, that has remained part of <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>tradition,</b> in contrast to Eastern Christianity, which avoids large religious sculpture. The Catechism, using very traditional arguments, posits that God gave permission for images that symbolize Christian salvation by leaving symbols such as the bronze serpent, and the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant. It states that [...] "by becoming incarnate, the Son of God introduced a new economy of images".|$|E
