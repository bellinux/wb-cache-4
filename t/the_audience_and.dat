5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>and</b> filters a set of responses for <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>and</b> goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, {{identifies}} friendship as the {{key factor}} behind {{the success of the}} two UNICEF shows, both in bringing all the participants together on the stage and in the affection with which <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>and</b> music critics viewed the event.

5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO.

5|$|Gilbert {{acted as}} stage {{director}} {{for his own}} plays and operas. He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>and</b> insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes. Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals. As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the overture for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case Alfred Cellier, to complete. Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
