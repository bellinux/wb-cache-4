40|$|The in-situ endograft fenestration, a {{possible}} surgical {{option for the}} minimally invasive treatment of aneurysms with unfavorable anatomy, is today limited by difficulties in targeting the fenestration site and {{by the lack of}} a safe method <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> graft. In this work we suggest the use of: a 3 D electromagnetic (EM) navigator, to accurately guide the endovascular instruments to the target, and a laser system, <b>to</b> selectively <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> graft. More particularly we propose to integrate a laser fiber into a sensorized guidewire and we describe an EM sensorization strategy to accurately guide the laser tool.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the importance of a micropulse program in determining the success of piezoelectric stapedotomy. Methods: A total of 112 patients (group A) affected by primary otosclerosis underwent piezoelectric stapedotomy for otosclerotic stapes fixation. A specific operative program was created <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> stapes footplate: this program makes it possible <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> footplate of the stapes with a predetermined and non-modifiable temporization. Before and 1 year after surgery, all the patients underwent the following instrumental examinations: pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and auditory brainstem response. Results were compared with those obtained from 30 patients who underwent piezoelectric stapedotomy without the specific operative program (group B). Results: At 1 year after surgery, with regard to the pure-tone audiometry test, all patients had an air-bone gap (ABG) reduction: no worsening of the bone conduction and no postoperative sensorineural hearing loss were found. In group A, there was a closure of the ABG within 10 dB in all patients. Conclusions: We can consider the micropulse program as the best level of safety that should be used in all cases of piezoelectric stapedotomy...|$|R

50|$|A {{perforation}} in {{the context}} of oil wells refers to a hole punched in the casing or liner of an oil well to connect it to the reservoir. In cased hole completions, the well will be drilled down past the section of the formation desired for production and will have casing or a liner run in separating the formation from the well bore. The final stage of the completion will involve running in perforating guns, a string of shaped charges, down to the desired depth and firing them <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> casing or liner. A typical perforating gun can carry many dozens of explosive charges.|$|R

5000|$|OBPgp279 is an {{endolysin}} that hydrolyzes peptidoglycan, a {{major constituent}} in bacterial membrane. OBPgp279 {{is found in}} Pseudomonas fluorescens phage OBP, which belongs in the Myoviridae family of bacteriophages. Because of its role in hydrolyzing the peptidoglycan layer, OBPgp279 is a key enzyme in the lytic cycle of the OBP bacteriophage; it allows the bacteriophage to lyse its host internally to escape. Unlike other endolysins, OBPgp279 does not rely on holins <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> inner bacterial membrane {{in order to reach}} the peptidoglycan layer. [...] Although OBPgp279 is not a well-studied enzyme, it has garnered interest as a potential antibacterial protein due to its activity against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The in situ {{fenestration}} of {{a standard}} endograft is currently limited by difficulties in targeting the fenestration site under fluoroscopic control and {{by the lack of}} a safe method <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> graft. Evidence in the literature suggests the use of a 3 [*]D electromagnetic navigator to accurately guide the endovascular instruments to the target and a laser <b>to</b> selectively <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> graft. The aim of this work is to provide design guidelines to develop a sensorized catheter to guide the laser tool to the fenestration site and conduct preliminary testing of the feasibility of the proposed solution. Matherials and methods: Different catheter designs were delineated starting from engineering considerations, then prototypes were preliminarily tested to collect surgeon opinions and to steer the design process toward the preferred solution reported by the user. Finally, mechanical simulations were performed with CathCAD, a design software system for the development of composite tubing for endovascular catheters. RESULTS: Based on surgeon feedback, a 9 -French steerable catheter with a stabilization system was designed. CathCAD simulations allowed us to define the construction parameters (e. g., materials and geometric constrains) for the fabrication of composite tubes with mechanical properties (flexural, axial, and torsional rigidities) compatible with target values in the literature for guiding catheters. CONCLUSION: The presented results preliminarily demonstrate the clinical reasonability and feasibility of the designed tool in terms of mechanical properties. Further mechanical tests and extensive in vitro clinical trials are required prior to animal testing...|$|R
50|$|Copper Water TubesCopper tubes {{have been}} used to {{distribute}} drinking water within buildings for many years, and hundreds of miles are installed throughout Europe every year. The long life of copper when exposed to natural waters is a result of its thermodynamic stability, its high resistance to reacting with the environment, and the formation of insoluble corrosion products that insulate the metal from the environment. The corrosion rate of copper in most drinkable waters is less than 2.5 µm/year, at this rate a 15 mm tube with a wall thickness of 0.7 mm would last for about 280 years. In some soft waters the general corrosion rate may increase to 12.5 µm/year, but even at this rate it would take over 50 years <b>to</b> <b>perforate</b> <b>the</b> same tube.|$|R
