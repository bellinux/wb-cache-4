Essentially, a primer is required to provide inter-coat adhesion between the pretreatment and the finish coat and is also required to promote corrosion resistance in the total system.

Potential benefits include Design-for-Environment (DfE) opportunities, increased manufacturing efficiencies, and future application to consumer-based eco-rating systems. Detailed and up-to-date LCI data for general application by LCI practitioners does not exist at this time {{for the majority of}} Manufacturing/Assembly processes in North America, including the automotive paint process. With an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) industry partner 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to a publicly available LCI database (i. e., NREL LCI Database), however, a representative vehicle assembly facility was selected for completion of a paint process LCI. A detailed LCI reference dataset was developed to include materials, energy, and emissions associated with the Pretreatment, E-coat, and <b>Top</b> <b>Coat</b> <b>paint</b> unit processes. The challenges and industry realities of completing the LCI enabled a detailed set of guidelines to be developed, adapting existing protocols to the specifics of the manufacturing paint process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} self-manufacturing cost estimation, cost optimization {{and competitiveness}} of different composite floor systems: composite I beams, composite trusses produced from rolled channel sections and composite trusses made from cold formed hollow sections. Part 1 of this two-part series of papers presents {{the estimation of}} the self-manufacturing (direct production) costs for composite and steel structures. The self-manufacturing costs are proposed to {{be defined as the}} sum of the material, the power consumption and the labour costs. The material costs of the structural steel, concrete, reinforcement, the shear connectors, electrodes, the anti-corrosion, fire protection and <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> <b>painting,</b> the formwork floor-slab panels and gas consumption are presented in detail. The power consumption costs comprise costs of sawing the steel sections, edge grinding, drilling, welding, stud welding and vibrating the concrete. The labour costs (times) presented define the costs of metal cutting, edge grinding, preparation, assembling and tacking, welding, welding of shear connectors, steel surface preparation and protection, drilling, cutting, placing and connecting the reinforcement, concreting, consolidating and curing the concrete. New approximation functions are proposed for the calculation of some manufacturing times and material consumptions. As the discussed costs vary significantly around the world, the proposed cost expressions are given in the open form to be used for cost estimation in different economic conditions. A numerical example of the estimation of the self-manufacturing costs for a composite I beam floor system shows the suitability of the proposed approach. On the basis of the defined self-manufacturing costs, introduced in Part 1, the cost optimization and the competitiveness of different composite floor systems are discussed in Part 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Paint {{is used as}} <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> in Automobile Refinishing that {{is divided}} into 1 K paint of base type and 2 K paint of {{urethane}} type. after using 1 K paint, it can be reusable. However 2 K paint is not available that is mixed {{a certain amount of}} base with hardner, so 2 K paint has to be used all at a time or discarded the rest. This study covered that colored Urethane paint and colorless urethane <b>paint</b> in <b>top</b> <b>coating</b> process of AR. <b>Top</b> <b>coat</b> urethane <b>paint</b> is divided into colored urethane paint and transparent urethane <b>paint</b> like clear <b>coat.</b> Colored urethane <b>paint</b> is used for paint that contains resin, pigment, solvent and additives. It is color such as black and white. While transparent urethane paint is used for paint that contains resin, solvent and additives. Urethane paint has a paint system that cur after several hours of mixing base and hardner. By a paint technician of a field and empirical data, we can also recognize that according to worker's paint style and experience, although he or she paint same car model and area, paint use of one's is different. There aren't guidelines workers refer to about paint use by car models and work scope because ARP works various car models that are in different color, size and area. After using urethane paint, the rest of paint has come, and there are highs and lows in paint use each time he or she works. Therefore, this study suggest a basic guideline to use paint efficiently and regularly by understanding area, the type of work, and paint use that are appropriate for each car model and regardless of workers and work scopes in AR...|$|R

40|$|Generating high barrier <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> for {{anticorrosive}} coating {{systems is}} increasingly performed using powder coatings.

30|$|A TBC is a {{multilayer}} {{coating system}} {{that consists of}} an insulating ceramic outer layer (<b>top</b> <b>coat)</b> and a metallic inner layer (bond coat) between the ceramic and the substrate. The function of the ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> is to insulate the metallic substrate from high surface temperature, thereby lowering the component’s temperature and reducing the oxidation and hot corrosion of bond coatings while simultaneously reducing cyclic thermal strains (Gurrappa and Sambasiva 2006). Recently, Kitazawa et al. (2010) have reported that a temperature gradient of 150 °C {{can be achieved by}} using a ceramic TBC (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 <b>top</b> <b>coat)</b> on superalloy components. In most cases, the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> and bond coats are applied by plasma spraying; however, sputtering and electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) are also used. The commonly used method of thermal spraying of TBCs on developed metal surfaces involves a metallic bond coating either by cold spraying (CS) or by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) followed by deposition of a ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> by either air plasma spraying (APS) or EBPVD.|$|R

40|$|Winner of the £ 30, 000 prize {{selected}} by Judith Collins, Sacha Craddock, Declan McGonagle, John Spurling and Wilf Weeks. This exhibition was significant in its juxtaposition of three painters from differing generations. It {{was concerned with}} how each artist set out to pre-determine the process for each painting from the outset. This included Lasker’s use of projected doodles, Heron’s jigsaw pieces which relied on building on an initial gesture; and Pratt’s distinctive ‘splash’ that initiates each piece and predestines {{the direction of the}} painting. The exhibition considered the differing approaches to pre-programming process in painting over time and era, and mapped the influences across the generations. Pratt’s paintings included in the exhibition deepened the enquiry into the diagrammatic and drawn element in her work and the generation of imagery through a build-up of drawn lines. The paintings deployed pioneering techniques, where the colours and materials mimicked each other and swapped places, for example, white paint as a ground made a raw canvas 'splash-shape' appear as a positive figure, instead of an omission. Paint was also used to quote other materials - glossy white <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> of oil <b>paint</b> performed as primer and the build-up of multi-coloured oil-paint layers slunk back as shadows. Pratt gave an artist’s talk on her methods and approach to painting {{in the context of the}} exhibition, to a gallery audience of peers on 21 February 2006. A discussion on her research with Gallery Director, Stephen Foster, was podcast and published on John Hansard Gallery website.

A numerical heat flow model has been used to explore the stress state under isothermal and thermal gradient conditions. Sintering proceeds faster at higher temperature, but is retarded by the presence of tensile stresses (from differential thermal expansion between coating and substrate) within the <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> Sintering occurs preferentially near the free surface of the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> under gradient conditions, {{not only because of the}} higher temperature, but also because the in-plane stress is more compressive in that region...|$|R
40|$|Advanced and {{baseline}} {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBCs) were thermal cycle tested in air at 1163 C until delamination or spallation of the ceramic <b>top</b> <b>coat.</b> The <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> {{of the advanced}} TBC s consisted of ZrO 2 with various amounts of Y 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, or Nd 2 O 3 dopants. The composition of the <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> of the baseline TBC was ZrO 2 - 8 wt. %Y 2 O 3. All <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> were deposited by air plasma spraying. A NiCrAlY or NiCoCrAlY bond coat was deposited by low pressure plasma spraying onto a single-crystal, Ni-base superalloy. The TBC lifetime for the baseline coatings was approximately 190 cycles (45 minutes at 1163 C per cycle) while the lifetime for the advanced coatings was as high as 425 cycles. The fracture surfaces and sample cross sections were examined after TBC failure by SEM and optical microscopy, and the <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> were further examined by X-ray diffraction. These post-test studies revealed that the fracture path largely followed splat boundaries with some trans-splat fracture. However, there were no obvious distinguishing features which explained the difference in TBC lifetimes between some of the advanced and baseline coatings...|$|R
40|$|Thermal spray {{coatings}} (TSCs) have complex microstructures {{and they}} often operate in demanding environments. Plasma sprayed (PS) thermal barrier coating (TBC) is one such ceramic layer that is applied onto metallic components where a low macroscopic stiffness favors stability by limiting the stresses from differential thermal contraction. In this paper, the Young’s modulus of TBC <b>top</b> <b>coat,</b> measured using different techniques, such as four-point bending, indentation and impulse excitation is reported, along with {{a brief description of}} how the techniques probe different length scales. Zirconia-based TBC <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> were found to have a much lower global stiffness than that of dense zirconia. A typical value for the as-sprayed Young’s modulus was ~ 23 GPa, determined by beam bending. Indentation, probing a local area, gave significantly higher values. The difference between the two stiffness values is thought to explain the wide range of TBC <b>top</b> <b>coat</b> Young’s modulus values reported in the literature. On exposure to high temperature, due to the sintering process, detached <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> exhibit an increase in stiffness. This increase in stiffness caused by the sintering of fine-scale porosity has significant impact on the strain tolerance of the TBC. The paper discusses the different techniques for measuring the Young’s modulus of the TBC <b>top</b> <b>coats</b> and implications of the measured values...|$|R
