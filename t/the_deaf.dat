5|$|ASL is used {{throughout}} Anglo-America. This contrasts with Europe, where {{a variety of}} sign languages are used within the same continent. The unique situation of ASL {{seems to have been}} caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf,</b> wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf.</b>|$|E
5|$|More {{schools for}} <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and the National Fraternal Society of <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 1870, the institute, {{which was}} later {{known as the}} West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute {{building}} with 25 deaf and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into {{the campus of the}} Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Trinity College, Covell {{accepted}} a teaching position in <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> Department of the Virginia School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and the Blind in Staunton, Virginia and relocated there in September 1847. Covell continued teaching until 1852 {{when he was}} made a vice-principal of the institution and given charge of the entire Deaf Mute Department.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1888, Gilkeson was {{delegated}} by the Board to Regents to attend the Conference of Superintendents and Principals of American Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> in New York City and select the most fitting candidate present at the conference or recommended someone to replace him as principal of the West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind. Gilkeson tendered an offer to C.H. Hill, then an instructor at the Maryland School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf,</b> and upon Gilkeson's return to Romney he recommended Hill and resigned from his post as principal. Hill was subsequently appointed by the Board to fill the position. While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and wished for him to stay on in the position, but he preferred {{to return to his}} professional law and political career in the end.|$|E

5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
5|$|ASL {{emerged as}} a {{language}} in the American School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> (ASD), founded in 1817. This school brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems; ASL was created in this situation of language contact. ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.|$|E

5|$|ASL {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the American School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817. Originally known as The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of <b>The</b> <b>Deaf</b> And Dumb, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foundation}} and success of the American School for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf,</b> many other institutions for <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black deaf children. The first school established for Black deaf children below the Mason–Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last Southern state to create an institution for Black deaf children was Louisiana in 1938. Black deaf children became a language community isolated from White deaf children, with different means of language socialization, allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, oralism—the prominent pedagogical method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools for <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the society's {{reorganization}} in 1869, the state of West Virginia considered the establishment of a school for <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and the blind. The society resolved to secure the new state institution for Romney. On April 12, 1870, the society passed a resolution by which the members agreed to deed, free of cost, the buildings and grounds of the Romney Classical Institute.|$|E

The thesis is based on Czech and foreign studies related to relevant topics...|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E
