5|$|Additionally, the Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) was a joint NASA/ESA flagship-class {{proposal}} for exploration of Saturn's moons, {{with a focus}} on Enceladus. TSSM was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) {{proposal for}} funding. In February 2009, it was announced that NASA/ESA had given the EJSM mission priority ahead of TSSM, although TSSM will continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> and evaluated.|$|E
5|$|Generally, parents {{register}} {{their children}} {{up to two}} years in advance, in order to secure a place at age 13, through sitting a Common Entrance exam, or via the award of an open Academic Scholarship.

Khai credited Phan with righteousness, loyalty and dedication towards the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|S. g. crissalis, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was {{described}} by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. It appears to have adapted well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, somewhere around 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, it has yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> with molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|The International Planetary Patrol Program {{was formed}} in 1969 as a {{consortium}} to continually monitor planetary changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars.

More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E
5|$|The sarus crane is {{classified}} as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Threats include habitat destruction and/or degradation, hunting and collecting, as well as environmental pollution and possibly diseases or competing species.

5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied.</b> The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E

5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Vijayanagara era, the Kaivalya {{tradition}} branched three ways. The first {{consisted of}} {{followers of the}} Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while the third was the branch that kept the vachana tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. So vast is this body of literature that much of it still needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied.</b>|$|E

Travelling to the Behavioral Sciences Unit, Black learns that serial killer Ephraim Fabricant (Alex Diakun) has escaped from a hospital while donating a kidney to his sister. Fabricant was arrested and convicted due to the profile constructed by Black; although he was spared execution when Black asked for leniency {{in order to allow}} Fabricant's mind <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2001, Heisley {{announced}} that he had selected Memphis. Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice would still have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied.</b> DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E

5|$|State Route 230 (SR230) is a legislated, but unconstructed, {{state highway}} {{to be located}} in Adams and Whitman {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Washington. The highway would begin at a junction with concurrent highways Interstate 90 (I-90) and U.S. Route 395 (US395) in Ritzville and travel east to an intersection with SR23 in Ewan. Plans for the first highway first emerged in 1945, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> after the conclusion of World War II, however no action has been taken on construction of the highway.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion {{is almost always}} regulated {{by the action of}} membrane-associated proteins. The first of these proteins <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>studied</b> were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.|$|E
