He interviewed the program's regular hosts, and also the rapper Eminem (whom he pretended never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of), and put a humorous slant on the local news and community calendar.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of the ILP.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with {{the first day of}} Baisakhi.|$|E

5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants {{are considered to be}} the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|Sarah and Queen Anne {{never made}} up their differences, {{although}} one eyewitness claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Anne asking whether the Marlboroughs had reached the shore, leading to rumours that she had called them home herself. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714 at Kensington Palace; the Protestant Whig Privy Councillors had insisted on their right to be present, preventing Henry St. John, the first Viscount Bolingbroke from declaring for the Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. The Marlboroughs returned home {{on the afternoon of}} Anne's death. The Act of Settlement of 1701 ensured a Protestant succession by passing over more than fifty stronger Roman Catholic claimants and proclaiming Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover (the great grandson of James I through Georg's mother Sophia of Hanover), King George I of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by blood poisoning (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E

Asquith and Kitchener (20 December) forbade French to replace Murray with Wilson.

25|$|Joe's former bodyguard, Jose Mulero (also {{known as}} Sing Sing), {{was arrested on}} September 17, 2004 for the April 15, 1994 {{shooting}} death of 16-year-old Ernesto Rivera at a Bronx nightclub. Responding to a subpoena, Fat Joe claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the shooting and seen people fleeing the scene, but investigators argued that he was standing closer to Mulero, by a door.|$|E
25|$|The {{black church}} {{continues}} {{to be a source of}} support for members of the African-American community. When compared to American churches as a whole, black churches tend to focus more on social issues such as poverty, gang violence, drug use, prison ministries and racism. A study found that black Christians were more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> about health care reform from their pastors than were white Christians.|$|E

25|$|Having briefly {{witnessed}} Paul preach in Rome, {{a servant}} returns to Spain and falls sick due to wishing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Paul properly. The master's wife, Xanthippe, overhears the servant explaining this, so she speaks privately with the servant, which causes statues {{of the household}} gods to fall down. Xanthippe thereupon proceeds to fast, pray, lose sleep, and enter into celibacy, gradually wasting away.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Ravel is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> Jimmie Noone and {{his group}} perform in Chicago. Despite the imprecise anecdote, Ravel's {{involvement}} with jazz is unquestionable, as it influenced many of his important works, for example the fox-trot of L'enfant et les sortilèges, the blues of the Sonata for violin and piano, Concerto in G and the Concerto for the left hand, both composed for piano in 1931.|$|E

The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger. He said the voices originated from a headstone of a deceased Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God.|$|E
25|$|The Choir of Groton School, of Groton, Massachusetts, USA, {{has been}} {{presenting}} a Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols since 1928, {{ten years after}} the service was introduced at King's. Groton holds the distinction of having the oldest tenured Lessons and Carols service in the United States. The school's first organist and choirmaster, Twining Lynes, is believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the service at King's, and shortly thereafter began the tradition with his choir at Groton. Since its inception, only seven organists have presided over the Groton service. Beginning in 2014, the choir has been conducted by Dan Moriarty.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Noonan {{had also}} {{received}} e-mail {{confirmation of the}} quote from Navarro-Valls before writing her December 17 column. Complicating the situation, Navarro-Valls told Dreher that the e-mail sent to McEveety was not genuine, suggesting it was fabricated. However, Noonan later verified {{that all of the}} Navarro-Valls e-mails came from the same Vatican IP address. The Los Angeles Times reported that they had previously confirmed the accuracy of the quote from Navarro-Valls when the story first broke.
