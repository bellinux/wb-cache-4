25|$|After Baldwin refused both bribes, Saladin {{turned his}} {{attention}} away from the uprisings in northern Syria and focused on Jacob’s Ford and the Castle of Chastellet. He was fully aware that any further bargaining or negotiations would only be in vain and that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> he wasted, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> Baldwin would have to complete his massive fortification. In 1179, only a few months after construction of Chastellet began, Saladin summoned a large Muslim army to march southeast towards Jacob’s Ford. The plan was simple: lay siege to the castle and its inhabitants before any reinforcements from Jerusalem or any of its neighboring territories could arrive.|$|E

25|$|Over time, {{however, the}} {{pheromone}} trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{it takes for}} an ant to travel down the path and back again, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> {{that has}} elapsed {{since the last}} civil war, the less {{likely it is that}} a {{conflict}} will recur. The study had two possible explanations for this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based. The elapsed time may represent the depreciation of whatever capital the rebellion was fought over and thus increase the opportunity cost of restarting the conflict. Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The study found that the presence of a diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.|$|E
25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E

However, impressions of dates made via video were to be much more negative than those made in person. An additional study that looked at characterization of a romantic partner suggested that {{people are more likely to}} rely on “gut reactions” when meeting in person, but there isn't sufficient information for this kind of evaluation when viewing someone online.|$|E

500|$|For most {{applications}} of hashing, {{it is necessary}} to compute the hash function for each value every time that it is hashed, rather than once when its object is created. In such applications, random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values, because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes. And cryptographic hash functions (which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables. Instead, other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised. These methods compute the hash function quickly, and can be proven to work well with linear probing. In particular, linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of -independent hashing, a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any -tuple of distinct keys to any -tuple of indexes. The parameter [...] {{can be thought of as}} a measure of hash function quality: the larger [...] is, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> it will take to compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} capture ghosts, Luigi must first use his {{flashlight}} {{to light up}} the ghost and stun it, revealing their heart.

Some ghosts cannot be captured easily until Luigi locates three special medallions, each granting the Poltergust with the ability to suck up certain elements from the rooms and use them to capture special ghosts lying within the mansion. In addition to capturing the regular ghosts in the mansion, Luigi must also draw out special, [...] "portrait ghosts" [...] from some rooms, each requiring a condition be met to make them available for capture. Once all the ghosts in a room are captured, it brightens up; the music also changes, being pleasantly whistled by Luigi, while being haunted and spooky when filled with ghosts, with Luigi humming nervously to the tune.|$|E
