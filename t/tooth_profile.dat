External gear pumps {{with three different}} types of <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> are studied. Nondimensional flowrates and fluctuation coefficients of gear pumps are discussed. By using the formula, flowrates can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Results indicate that: {{in the case of}} the same displacement (except teeth number and tooth width, other parameters of the gear pump are the same) the gear pump flow pulsation decreases with the increasing of the teeth number. We also concluded that changing <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> on the driving and driven gear can get different pulse amplitude of the flow ripple...|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the <b>tooth</b> <b>profile.</b> There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|E

5000|$|Pressure angle in {{relation}} to gear teeth, {{also known as the}} angle of obliquity, is the angle between the tooth face and the gear wheel tangent. It is more precisely the angle at a pitch point between the line of pressure (which is normal to the tooth surface) and the plane tangent to the pitch surface. The pressure angle gives the direction normal to the <b>tooth</b> <b>profile.</b> The pressure angle is equal to the profile angle at the standard pitch circle and can be termed the [...] "standard" [...] pressure angle at that point. Standard values are 14.5, 20 and 25 degrees. Earlier gears with pressure angle 14.5 were commonly used because the cosine is larger for a smaller angle, providing more power transmission and less pressure on the bearing; however, teeth with smaller pressure angles are weaker. To run gears together properly their pressure angles must be matched.|$|E
