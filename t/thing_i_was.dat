500|$|The {{arrival of}} new signing of Peter Beardsley left Walsh {{restricted}} to only sporadic {{appearances in the}} 1987–88 campaign, and he played just nine games without scoring a goal, though maintained fitness by playing games for the reserves. He began drinking heavily, later admitting [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in by that point was getting pissed and enjoying myself".|$|E
500|$|The {{debut album}} was {{completed}} and being mastered when Carey wrote [...] "Love Takes Time" [...] with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, [...] "It {{was sort of}} a gospelish <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ordinary men {{placed in}} {{extraordinary}} circumstances" [...] is a prevalent theme in The Sword of Shannara. Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction. [...] "y protagonists are {{cut from the}} same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. It was Tolkien's genius to reinvent the traditional epic fantasy by making the central character neither God nor hero, but a simple man {{in search of a}} way to do the right <b>thing.</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> impressed enough by how it had changed the face of epic fantasy that I never gave a second thought to not using it as the cornerstone of my own writing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Palmer and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In October 2000, {{it was confirmed that}} singer-songwriter Cher would guest star on Will & Grace as herself. She filmed her appearance on October 17. Cher revealed, [...] "We did two endings. I improvised one. I hope they show it as an outtake 'cause the audience loved that one more than the one they're gonna show. Instead of the <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> supposed to do, I did something to Sean [...] something completely different and he just about passed out. I don't know what possessed me." [...] It was also announced that actress Camryn Manheim would appear. Cher would later guest star on Will & Grace two years later.|$|E
500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing the damn <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!... put something on it... Make it different.'" [...] Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the stories}} she wrote spoke of {{the wealth of the}} region being in its [...] "inevitable development", and she {{supplemented}} her income with $100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life. She wrote a ballad in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 22-year-old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp, titled [...] "Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now". It was printed in The Miami Herald, and read aloud during a session of the Florida Legislature, which passed a law banning convict leasing, in large part due to her writing. [...] "I think that's the single most important <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever able to accomplish as a result of something I've written", she wrote in her autobiography.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional <b>thing...</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{politician}} and journalist Bill Deedes wrote in 2000: [...] "while the Second World War was on, I consoled myself by thinking that Canterbury Cricket Week, founded in 1842 with its tents and famous lime tree, unchanging {{in a changing}} world, {{was the sort of}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in business to preserve." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "That {{was when}} I first heard someone play {{something}} like my style. He {{was a real}} Hawaiian boy, from over in the islands, and he was playing this way and I loved it. I'd go to them parties just to watch him play," [...] Kirby said. [...] "Then I'd {{go home and get}} my guitar and try to do the same <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just playing a straight guitar and I had to raise the strings up, put a nut under the strings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did I ever {{undertake}} to play it?" [...] Sir Richmond appealed. [...] "Why has it {{been put}} upon me? Seeing what a poor <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> why <b>am</b> <b>I</b> not a poor thing altogether?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The blog {{ended in}} November 2013. In his last post, Brown {{expressed}} regret over his writing about Assange, saying [...] "I was half-right, but all wrong" [...] and expanding: [...] "Assange is as I described him, but who cares? Wikileaks {{has continued to}} do important work, releasing the Kissinger cables and aiding with the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. By taking aim at Assange, I was guilty of the very <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> accusing him of: distracting the public from what’s important".|$|E
2500|$|An anti-imperialist writer, Orwell {{promotes}} the idea that, through imperialism, both conqueror and conquered are destroyed. Orwell clearly states his displeasure with colonial Britain: [...] "I {{had already made}} up my mind that imperialism was an evil <b>thing...</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> all for the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British." [...] The narrator perceives that the conqueror is not in control, but it is rather {{the will of the people}} that governs his actions. As ruler, he notes that it is his duty to appear resolute, with his word being final.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the album's keyboard-dominated production nor the band's commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in November 1986 to pursue a solo career. [...] "I didn't really like the direction the band was going in," [...] Norum said, [...] "We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band and I hated that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff {{and it seemed like}} the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial. So I decided to leave. I just wanted to move on and do something else." ...|$|E

2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I asked him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, the Kansas City Royals {{announced}} that they had hired Sweeney as a special assistant to baseball operations. Sweeney's response to receiving the new job: [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unable to accomplish during my playing days was to bring October baseball back to Kansas City. With this new position, my goal is {{do as much as}} I can to help the Royals get back to being one of the prized organizations in baseball, {{as it was in the}} 1980s." [...] Sweeney settled into the role quite quickly, attending the Royals' spring training in Surprise, Arizona as a guest instructor that same month. That year, the Royals made the postseason for the first time in 29 years.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then {{after a while he}} suggested I come in with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we were out on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E
