Lumps of green cold water toppled over the bulwark {{and on their}} heads. They hung {{for a moment on}} strained arms, with the breath knocked out of them, and with closed eyes--then, letting go with one hand, balanced with lolling heads, trying to grab some rope or stanchion further forward. The long-armed and athletic boatswain swung quickly, gripping things with a fist hard as iron, and remembering suddenly snatches of the last letter from his [...] "old woman."

[...] Wamibo's tongue hung out with excitement; and Archie, intrepid and calm, watched his chance to move with intelligent coolness.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{vertical}} fracture sys tem in bituminous coalbeds {{is called}} cleat. Cleat orientation commonly controls {{the direction of}} mining with major development paralleling the face cleat. Previous researchers have categorized the origin of cleat as endogenetic, relating the origin of cleat to compaction and coalification, and exogenetic, relating the origin of cleat to tectonic forces. In the coalbeds studied for this report {{it was found that}} tectonic forces were the controlling factor of cleat formation. Face cleats were formed as extension fractures during structural deformation, and butt cleats, as release fractures during erosion and uplift. The face cleat of the Pittsburgh coalbed rotates from N 8020 W in north- western West Virginia to N 5720 W in southwestern Pennsylvania; the face cleat maintains a perpendicular orientation to the shifting axial trend of local structures. Cleat orientation in other bituminous coalbeds in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, and Central Pennsylvania showed a similar relationship to local structure. Directional permeability of coal is directly related <b>to</b> <b>cleat.</b> Holes drilled perpendicular to the face cleat yield from 2. 5 to 10 times the amount of gas released as compared with holes drilled perpendicular to the butt cleat...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} relationship between cleat spacing, cleat height and coal banding texture for Queensland Permian age coals of different rank, four of which are presented here. Whereas relationships between cleat frequency and rank, and with coal type or grade, {{have been reported in}} the past, relationships between the spacing and height among the different kinds of cleats are not quantitatively established. For other layered sedimentary rocks, joint or fracture spacing relates directly to both bed thickness and rock strength. Coal is similar to other layers rocks. Four major classes of cleats were distinguished, which were separate data populations when cleat spacing was plotted against cleat height; master cleats, single vitrain layer cleats, multiple vitrain layer package cleats, and durain (dull coal) cleats. Understanding the relationship between cleat height and spacing for specific coals, and the specific kinds of cleats within those coals, will lead to more accurate predictions of cleat density and hence coal permeability. This can improve modelling and prediction of methane gas deliverability in coal seams. In the Australian Permian coals studied, narrowly spaced cleats exist at all ranks, but the distribution of cleat spacing with cleat height is what varies for specific cleat classes. Cleat spacing was found to be directly proportional <b>to</b> <b>cleat</b> height in most cases...|$|E

50|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, {{a method}} for delivering supplies to the point had to be developed.

Since there was no beach landing, the boats would anchor <b>to</b> <b>cleats</b> cemented into the lava rocks at the point. A boom derrick, constructed on a ledge above the water, would pluck the supplies from the boats and place them on a loading platform 110 ft above the water.|$|R

50|$|After {{eight years}} of use, the FieldTurf surface was removed to begin the {{installation}} of a newer, more updated version of the FieldTurf product. The synthetic playing field uses FieldTurf's top end Classic HD technology, the same playing surface used {{by the majority of}} NFL stadiums. The three layer infill system allows for optimal player safety, while delivering a softer touch and reduced heat mapping. Using polymer process geometry, the turf is 14% less abrasive, reduces water splash by 62%, and is a 130 micron improvement over the previous surface's depth. The top layer consists of cryogenic rubber with the middle being a combination of cryogenic rubber and a silica sand mix. Silica sand fills the third layer which gives added grip <b>to</b> <b>cleats</b> as they dig into the surface.|$|R
