5|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> available to determine the degree of cirrhosis present. Transient elastography (FibroScan) is the test of choice, but it is expensive. Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index may be used when cost is an issue.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic tests may be {{conducted}} for various reasons. Firstly, some <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> needed {{to confirm or}} refute the diagnosis. Secondly, some are needed to identify any potential complications.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of neurological symptoms, Kayser–Fleischer rings {{and a low}} ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> needed.|$|E
30|$|The Mann–Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to compare}} {{continuous}} variables between two groups, and Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to compare}} dichotomous variables between two groups. The Mantel–Haenszel χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used for comparisons between two groups involving ordered categorical variables, and the χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to compare groups involving non-ordered categorical variables. Correlations were analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation. All <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> two-tailed and conducted at the 5 % significance level. Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used when comparing two related samples.|$|R
50|$|While monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{treated the}} same as fuzz testing and the two terms are usually used together, some believe they are different by arguing that monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random actions while fuzz <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random data input. Monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> also different from ad-hoc testing in that ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> performed without planning and documentation and the objective of ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> to divide the system randomly into subparts and check their functionality, {{which is not the}} case in monkey testing.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> used {{to confirm the}} presence of a hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|The most {{stringent}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{reserved for}} drugs and foodstuffs. For these, {{a number of}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed and}} reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
50|$|The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> finally produced. Trial {{questions}} are included and various {{versions of the}} <b>test</b> <b>are</b> prepared to avoid cheating. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{reliability}} <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{the focus}} in the research of reliability testing at present. The basic concepts of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> introduced. Names of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> sorted. Characteristics of mechanical reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The key issues of mechanical reliability testing and its development are then reviewed. Finally, some possible fields in the research are summarized...|$|R
30|$|Qualitative {{phytochemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} for the identification of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, tannin, gums, and terpenoids in the samples [12]. Alkaloids were detected using the Dragendroff’s, Mayer’s, Hager’s and Wagner’s tests. Lead acetate, alkaline reagent, ferric chloride and ammonia <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used for detection of flavonoids. Legal’s test, Molisch, Keller-Kiliani and Borntrager’s <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> performed to identify glycosides. For identification of tannin potassium dichromate test, ferric chloride, potassium hydroxide and lead acetate <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> followed. Salkowski <b>test</b> and froth <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used to detect the presence of terpenoids and for saponins respectively. Molisch <b>test</b> <b>was</b> performed for detecting the existence of gum in the samples.|$|R
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|England's mid-year {{tests and}} end of year <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{televised}} live by Sky Sports while end of year matches are highlighted by BBC Three on that game day and repeated on BBC Two the next day. England's 2014 end of year international against Samoa was not highlighted on BBC Three. All Six Nations games are shown for free on the BBC and ITV from 2016.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The diagnosis is made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E
50|$|A <b>test</b> tube <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{distilled}} water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> added. If the drop dissipates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive, indicating an exudate.|$|R
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for {{comparisons}} of the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed rank <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison of the two groups. Kruskal–Wallis, One way Anova, and Welch <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison {{of more than two}} groups. Spearman’s Rho <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to analyze correlations among the variables.|$|R
30|$|Pearson’s χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to perform}} {{categorical}} analysis, and Spearman’s correlation <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to determine}} correlations. For further evaluations, univariate analysis of variance, the paired t-test, the Kruskall–Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney-U <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Other blood <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{often taken}} to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|PCR {{tests have}} been {{developed}} to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.|$|E
50|$|The Mann-Whitney U test / Wilcoxon rank-sum <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as the Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test,</b> {{although}} both <b>are</b> nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann-Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to matched or dependent samples.|$|R
50|$|Copy <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> that evaluates {{advertising}} copy and creative executions. In this section, the principal methods of copy <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> briefly discussed.|$|R
40|$|The multisample {{version of}} the Cucconi rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem is proposed. Even though little known, the Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> of {{interest}} for several reasons. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> compared with some Lepage-type <b>tests.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> slightly {{more powerful than the}} multisample Lepage test. Moreover, its <b>test</b> statistic can <b>be</b> computed analytically whereas several others cannot. A practical application example in experimental nutrition is presented. An R function to perform the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use. Generally, the diagnosis can be determined by a CT scan of the head if done within six hours. Occasionally a lumbar puncture is also required. After confirmation further <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends in the}} {{parallel}} universe where Olivia, having broken Walternate's conditioning making her believe herself to be Fauxlivia, is told that no further <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> needed. A vision of Peter warns Olivia that her usefulness to Walternate has ended and her life is in danger.|$|E
5|$|The {{world record}} {{partnership}} between Jayawardene and Sangakkara for 624 runs, and the partnership between Jayasuriya and Mahanama for 576 runs (which was the previous world record, {{and is now}} the second-highest partnership in <b>Tests)</b> <b>are</b> the only Test partnerships to surpass 500 runs.|$|E
40|$|Task 3 {{experimental}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> concluded this quarter. Second-stage {{testing of}} first-stage distilled filtrates {{and of a}} Wilsonville resid from Run 263 were completed. The first-stage filtrates {{were found to have}} higher reactivity than the Wilsonville material. Task 4 experimental <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> initiated. First-stage microautoclave <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> made at reduced catalyst loading and reduced solvent to coal ratio without negatively affecting coal conversion. Lower severity second-stage catalytic upgrading <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> begun. The single-pass resid conversion obtained in the first completed second-stage <b>test</b> <b>was</b> high (67 - 69 %) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{time series}} analysis, two {{well-known}} {{versions of a}} portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>are</b> available for <b>testing</b> for autocorrelation in the residuals of a model: it tests whether any {{of a group of}} autocorrelations of the residual time series are different from zero. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> the Ljung-Box <b>test,</b> which <b>is</b> an improved version of the Box-Pierce <b>test,</b> having <b>been</b> devised at essentially the same time; a seemingly trivial simplification (omitted in the improved <b>test)</b> <b>was</b> found to have a deleterious effect. This portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>is</b> useful in working with ARIMA models.|$|R
50|$|Bartlett's <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{sensitive}} to departures from normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's <b>test</b> may simply <b>be</b> <b>testing</b> for non-normality. Levene's {{test and the}} Brown-Forsythe <b>test</b> <b>are</b> alternatives to the Bartlett <b>test</b> that <b>are</b> less {{sensitive to}} departures from normality.|$|R
5|$|There {{are various}} neuroimaging {{investigations}} that may detect cerebral sinus thrombosis. Cerebral edema and venous infarction may be apparent on any modality, {{but for the}} detection of the thrombus itself, the most commonly used <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both using various types of radiocontrast to perform a venogram and visualise the veins around the brain.|$|E
5|$|These <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{useful in}} a range of medical specialisms, {{including}} infectious disease, oncology, human leucocyte antigen typing (which investigates and predicts immune function), coagulation, and pharmacogenomicsthe genetic prediction of which drugs will work best. They overlap with clinical chemistry (medical tests on bodily fluids).|$|E
5|$|To {{distinguish}} various subtypes, polysomnography is required. This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of electrical activity in the brain), electrocardiography (same for electrical activity in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E
50|$|Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> used {{to check}} if any new bugs have been {{introduced}} through previous bug fixes. Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> conducted after every change or update in the software features. This <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> periodic, depending on the length and features of the software.|$|R
