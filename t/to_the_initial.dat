5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with {{the first and third}} line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle {{is an example of a}} fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> subject of the form being the pastoral.|$|E

Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E

5|$|Fruiting begins {{about six}} weeks after the initial {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting.

In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and the future M-140 corridor was assigned to part of the original M-11. On November 11, 1926, M-11 was redesignated as part of US31 in the state.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{propose a}} rough-set-based {{clustering}} algorithm for multiple data stream, which {{solve the problem}} that existing clustering algorithm for multiple data streams can {{not take into account}} conflicts between clustering quality and efficiency. Firstly, the algorithm calculates the distance between data stream <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> equivalence relations, and calculates the similarity between <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> equivalence relation <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> cluster. In <b>the</b> second place, the similarity between <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> clusters is used <b>to</b> merge <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> clusters. Finally, k-means clustering algorithm is called <b>to</b> dynamically adjust <b>the</b> clustering results, and then real-time clustering structure is obtained. In conclusion Experimental results demonstrated that the algorithm has higher efficiency and clustering quality...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the early}} Meiji era {{witnessed}} a warming between the imperial court and foreign powers, relations with France temporarily soured due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> support by France for the Shogun.

The modernization of the country had started during the last years of the Shogunate, and the Meiji government ultimately adopted the same policy.|$|E

The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim CEO. In 2000 Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment.|$|E
