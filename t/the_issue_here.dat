25|$|In 1995, the Chicago/Gary Airport Compact {{was signed}} by the cities of Chicago and Gary, Indiana, {{creating}} a new administration for the Gary/Chicago International Airport just across the state line. While markedly smaller than the proposed Peotone site, this airport already has more land and a longer main runway than Midway Airport. Gary is also many miles closer than Peotone to downtown Chicago. In addition public transportation is already in place to the Loop via the South Shore Line. Indiana and the FAA have provided significant funding for a Gary runway expansion, currently under construction. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> is {{a large portion of}} the revenue that is generated would go to the state of Indiana as opposed to Chicago and the state of Illinois, the very entities the airport would mainly serve.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously been a lot of controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here,</b> and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E
500|$|President Bush avoided federal antipoverty issues, {{and instead}} used Kemp as a {{mouthpiece}} {{to speak on}} the administration's low priority conservative activist agenda. Bush's contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his [...] "Points of Light" [...] theme, and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from Presidential candidate Bill Clinton. By {{the time of the}} Los Angeles riots of 1992, Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones, tenant ownership and welfare reform: [...] Mort Zuckerman compared Bush's vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car. Nonetheless, the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration, even though at first, Kemp had been overlooked. However, Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemp's success in advance best when he said in 1989, [...] "Good ideas with money can do a whole lot. Good ideas without money aren't probably going to do a whole lot," [...] and <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> was the decision not to fund Kemp's ideas. Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions, he was among the administration's leading users of first class corporate jets. He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary.|$|E

2500|$|The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals {{held that}} the FCC failed to justify its {{exercise}} of ancillary authority to regulate Internet service providers' network management practices.

2500|$|Kingsolver {{was criticized}} for a Los Angeles Times opinion piece {{following}} the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks. She wrote, [...] "I feel like I'm standing on a playground where the little boys are all screaming at each other, 'He started it!' and throwing rocks that keep taking out another eye, another tooth. I keep looking around for somebody's mother to come on the scene saying, 'Boys! Boys! Who started it cannot possibly be <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here.</b> People are getting hurt." [...] One reader cited her essay as an example of the [...] "shabby nihilism of the left."

On one hand, this is arguably the most mechanically sound sports game on the market and the gameplay improvements that Visual Concepts made are downright superb. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>here</b> lies with the decision to make Livin ‘Da Dream the focus and backbone of MyCareer falling flat. There are some moments throughout Spike Lee’s in-game film that might bring a smile to your face, but this story doesn’t lend itself to this franchise’s gameplay or the video game medium itself. Yes, basketball fans will likely have a great time playing NBA 2K16 for hours on end, but there are too many small steps back here that can’t be ignored. The good news for fans of sports games is that the first misstep in this great franchise is still a very good game, which speaks to how truly fun its gameplay is." ...|$|E

[...] Perales injured his back and subsequently had lumbar spinal surgery. [...] He was deemed to have had a successful result by his physician and others who reviewed his case.
