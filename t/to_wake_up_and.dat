25|$|The {{impact of}} natural predators on Indiana bats is minimal {{compared}} to the damage to habitat and mortality caused by humans, especially during hibernation. The presence of people in caves can cause Indiana bats {{to come out of}} hibernation, leading to a large increase in the energy used by the bats. By causing Indiana bats <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> use greater amounts of energy stores, humans can cause high mortality in a cave population of hibernating Indiana bats. Human disturbance and the degradation of habitat are the primary causes for the decline of the Indiana bat.|$|E

Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, {{continues}} alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, {{and goes back to}} sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.|$|E

However, Kröd starts <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and,</b> having missed {{sleeping}} with Aneka, starts to spoon her still unconscious body. Dongalor orders his guards to kill Kröd but, seeing how weak and disoriented he is from the potion, opts to do so himself and begins taunting Kröd, planning to torture him by killing the still-unconscious Aneka, and then Krӧd. However, a mysterious man (James Murray) swings through a nearby window, knocks Dongalor and Barnabus away, saving Kröd and Aneka, who are dragged {{out of the room}} by their friends to safety.|$|E

500|$|Before New Amerykahs release, {{the album}} was {{tentatively}} called KahBa, which Badu derived from her name, as a reference to Islam and Kemetism. The title of the album series, New Amerykah, is a pun of Badu's name. She has explained one meaning of it as [...] "a statement that simply says, 'This {{is the beginning of}} the new world'-for both the slaves and the slave masters.

500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E

[...] He went on, saying that Catholics must know the faith in order to [...] "join the battle" [...] engaging in [...] "spiritual combat, immortal warfare". Citing Pope Leo XIII's comment that [...] " [...] are born for combat", Voris said Catholics are an army and [...] "When an army loses its fighting spirit, when it takes its eye off the objective it will lose the war... a call to arms for Catholics <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fight—for the true, the good, and the beautiful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some Christian {{fundamentalist}} {{audiences and}} venues shunned Bryant after her divorce. Because {{she was no}} longer invited to appear at their events, she lost another major source of income. With three of her four children, she moved from Miami to Selma, Alabama, and later to Atlanta, Georgia. In a 1980 Ladies' Home Journal article she said, [...] "The church needs <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems." [...] She also expressed some sympathy for feminist aspirations, given her own experiences of emotional abuse within her previous marriage. Bryant also commented on her anti-gay views and said, [...] "I'm more inclined to say live and let live, just don't flaunt it or try to legalize it." [...] However, the biography page on her Anita Bryant Ministries website (written in 2006) continues to defend her earlier anti-gay activism and views.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subsequent}} {{civil case}} trial {{was held in}} 1998 with the charges that the Ku Klux Klan incited the crime. The case was brought to court by the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented by attorney Morris Dees. The lawyer for the Klan insisted that the criminals acted alone in burning down the church. Defense attorney Gary White painted the Klan Grand Dragon Horace King as a feeble old man merely exercising his right to free speech, saying King never authorized the arson. During the trial, the Church's lawyers showed racist Klan posters and literature and played a videotape for the jury showing King speaking at a Klan rally, saying [...] "It's time, people, <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> shape up {{and say this is}} our country, white people, take it back." [...] The Klan leaders insisted that they never encouraged anyone to break the law, but two of the sentenced arsonists testified against their case. Welch testified, [...] "The church fire was Klan business, and we were told we would not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable." [...] Both Welch and Cox said that they testified against the Klan to atone for what they'd done.|$|E
