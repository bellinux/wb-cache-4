25|$|Once {{the hijackers}} noticed the airstars moving towards them, they {{recognised}} the imminent assault. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, {{it became apparent}} that it was elevated too much higher than the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> of the plane was not as compressed, leading to the an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs. After a short delay in re positioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers {{in the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{originally}} was to improve <b>the</b> rear <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> of a race classic car called Garbi GTS, a very similar model to the famous Lotus 7, due to its lack of grip and low stability in turn. In order to introduce a significant improvement to <b>the</b> rear <b>suspension,</b> {{it was necessary to}} extract the rear live axle and to install an independent <b>suspension</b> to solve <b>the</b> lack of grip that was experimenting the car. However, it was not the only cause of this fact; a design problem in <b>the</b> front <b>suspension</b> was observed. Due to a suitable <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> is made accordingly to, in part, a correct relation between the front and rear suspension geometry, it was necessary to re-design all <b>the</b> Garbi’s <b>suspension</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> {{aim of this}} project became to design a suitable <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> rather than improve only the rear one. Because of this, it was impossible to a single person in the project’s time limits to perform all stablished milestones. For example, an important one was to perform dynamic simulations of <b>the</b> designed <b>suspension</b> components {{as well as of the}} new chassis in order to prove enough resistance of them in driving conditions and to improve their design to reduce weight. In this project, it can be found a brief description of the basic parameters which directly affect <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as live axle and double A-Arm suspension description, which are two different types of suspension used. Moreover, there is general theory related to kinematics and dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Following an iterative design process, a kinematic and dynamic study of <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> has been performed in order to find a suitable <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> to <b>the</b> Garbi GTS.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> {{keeps the}} coil {{centered}} in the gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving.

The spider is usually made of a corrugated fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin.

2500|$|The tuned {{mass damper}} system was used by several teams, notably Renault, during {{the latter part of}} 2005 and the 2006 seasons. The devices were located in the nosecone, and were {{particularly}} effective in corners and over kerbs to keep the tyres in closer contact to the track surface than they would otherwise be. After the French Grand Prix, the FIA announced that the system would be outlawed. This had a particularly significant effect on Renault, as the team had effectively built their cars around the devices, and had introduced them as long ago as the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix. At the German Grand Prix the Renault team submitted one of their cars for scrutineering by the race stewards, who ruled that the devices were acceptable. The FIA launched an appeal against this decision, and on 23 August 2006 the FIA International Court of Appeal issued a statement upholding this appeal and rejecting the stewards' decision. The Court of Appeal stated that the system infringed part of the bodywork section (Article 3.15) of the Formula One Technical Regulations, which stated that any specific part of the car influencing its aerodynamic performance had to: comply with the rules relating to bodywork, be rigidly secured to the entirely sprung part of the car (rigidly secured means not having any degree of freedom), and remain immobile in relation to the sprung part of the car.
