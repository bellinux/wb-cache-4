5|$|Historically {{the role}} of French rugby coach (or trainer) has varied considerably.

Therefore, a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were a perfect fit for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century the Catholic {{population}} of Semarang had become {{large enough to}} support multiple parishes. In 1915 the chapel in Karangpanas, {{in the southern part}} of Semarang, was elevated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> parish church and dedicated to St. Athanasius. A third church, in the Randusari area of western Semarang, was established in 1927 and became a parish church in 1930. Further parishes were established over the following decades, until in 2000 St. Joseph's Church was one of nine parish churches in the city, serving the subdistricts of East Semarang, Genuk, Sayung, and parts of North Semarang.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> its builder, Doune {{reflected}} current {{ideas of}} what a royal castle building should be. It was planned as a courtyard with ranges of buildings on each side, although only the northern and north-western buildings were completed. These comprise a large tower house over the entrance, containing the rooms of the Lord and his family, and a separate tower containing the kitchen and guest rooms. The two are linked by the great hall. The stonework is almost all from the late 14th century, with only minor repairs {{carried out in the}} 1580s. The restoration of the 1880s replaced the timber roofs and internal floors, as well as interior fittings.|$|E
5|$|England had {{suffered}} Viking raids {{in the late}} 8th century, but no attacks are recorded between 794 and 835, when the Isle of Sheppey in Kent was ravaged.

In June 2002, Al-Kateb stated that he wished to voluntarily leave Australia and be sent to Kuwait or to Gaza. However attempts by the Government of Australia to remove Al-Kateb to Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, and the Palestinian territories (which would have required the approval of Israel) failed.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E

5|$|The priory was {{elevated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and {{the monks}} founded {{a school for}} lay monks {{to help build a}} self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups would eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.|$|E
5|$|The priory was {{established}} as an Augustinian foundation in the 12thcentury, and was raised <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> an abbey in 1391. The abbey was closed in 1536, {{as part of}} the dissolution of the monasteries. Nine years later the surviving structures, together with the manor of Norton, were purchased by SirRichard Brooke, who built a Tudor house on the site, incorporating part of the abbey. This was replaced in the 18thcentury by a Georgian house. The Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was partially demolished in 1928. In 1966 the site was given in trust {{for the use of the}} general public.|$|E
