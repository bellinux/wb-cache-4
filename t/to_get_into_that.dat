Like the other two teams, Jarrett struggled, failing to qualify for twelve races and not scoring a single pole or top 10 finish, leading to a dismal 41st-place points finish.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Threshold" [...] {{is about}} {{reaching}} one's limit {{with a person}} in a situation where one is about to break—and are about to blow up as they get [...] "under your skin", while [...] "Cast Down" [...] features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. [...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted he was trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> mindset." ...|$|E
50|$|As of 2008, {{there were}} 250 {{students}} {{on a waiting list}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Cornelius. <b>That</b> year, the number of students attending Cornelius was 1,070.|$|R
25|$|In 2006 {{successfully}} {{represented the}} nine Afghan asylum seekers who hijacked a plane at gunpoint <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Britain <b>that</b> {{they should have}} been allowed to remain in the country on human rights grounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly; but {{his party}} {{numbered}} only three. However, we won't talk now. We {{have other things}} <b>to</b> do. <b>Get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> cave. And don't try to escape, or {{it will be the}} worse for you." ...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Guitar Mix" [...] {{features}} Vernon Reid of Living Colour. Reid stated, [...] "'Black Cat' {{was one of}} {{my favorite}} tracks on Rhythm Nation. I had the song and learned the parts, the structure of it, and just went in and did it. I think we used the second take. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> arena thing. It's meant to sound really big." [...] Jesse Johnson provided a guitar solo which was not used for the album version, but is featured in each of its remixes. The remixes have the added component of live drumming performed by Derek Organ of Switch, showcasing more of a heavy metal feel in the extended solo and double kick drums. Both versions omit the panther roar introduction and vocal refrain closing from the album edit.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1994 {{the band}} moved to Crossover Soundstage in Atlanta, Georgia. At Crossover, {{most of the}} album's basic tracks were {{recorded}} live, as if the band were playing in concert. Litt said, [...] "I thought since they hadn't toured in a while, {{it would be good}} for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> mind-set--you know, monitors, PA, standing up". The sessions were hampered by a number of events, including Berry and bassist Mike Mills falling ill on separate occasions, Buck and Stipe leaving to visit family members, and the deaths of Stipe's friends River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain. The band wrote and recorded [...] "Let Me In" [...] in tribute to Cobain, and dedicated the album to Phoenix, whose sister Rain sang background vocals on [...] "Bang and Blame".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, French actress Élodie Yung {{was cast}} as Jinx for the 2013 film [...] Jinx was {{featured}} in the first promotional pictures and trailer, shown sparring against Snake Eyes while clad in red and blindfolded, and fighting together with him against the Red Ninjas while wearing a yellow suit. Yung, who already owned a black belt in karate, prepared {{for about a month}} for the role, focusing on her cardio [...] "because of how demanding it all was", and training in the Chinese martial art wushu for dual sword fighting. The cliff battle scene required two months of green screen work to be done. Yung also said: [...] "I was wearing a yellow costume that got pretty hot. It looks sexy, but I needed five people <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> suit." [...] According to MTV, [...] "the totally silent mountainside battle between Snake Eyes, Jinx and a squad of Cobra ninjas mirrors the similarly silent comic book issue in the original Marvel series, which depicts Snake Eyes rescuing Scarlett from a Cobra castle in the Balkans." ...|$|E
60|$|The troopers sent {{to follow}} Larry King {{came back to}} camp, saying that they had lost him {{and that they could}} not find any place where it was {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down <b>into</b> <b>that</b> gorge.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Rateau, sure enough," [...] he said. [...] "I saw {{his face}} quite {{distinctly}} and heard his abominable cough. He is trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Paris. <b>That</b> road leads nowhere but to the barrier. There, of course, he will be stopped, and--" ...|$|R
50|$|By {{running a}} hotel, {{services}} and {{stores in the}} same building, {{the costs of the}} stadium should not be a problem anymore because of the profit. It is also quite easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> investors <b>into</b> <b>that</b> kind of project in Iceland.|$|R
60|$|It was necessary, therefore, or {{at least}} he thought so, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> section of the woods over which he had {{previously}} journeyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} about that," [...] said Jock; [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> kind of {{practice}} just yet. It is fitter for a family man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you say, George," [...] asked Billie in an undertone, [...] "if we side-step the Amber Drawing-Room? I'm wild <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> garden. There's a man working {{among those}} roses. Maybe {{he would show}} us round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{always thought}} swells {{had a pretty}} soft snap {{when they went to}} bed; but I never counted on its bein' {{anything}} like this. Do you s'pose she means for us <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right <b>into</b> <b>that</b> bed, an' muss it all up?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Canadian comedy troupe The Frantics mention Fisher {{in their}} sketch, Heaven is for Presbyterians. In the sketch, the {{archangel}} Gabriel tells a Catholic trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Heaven <b>that</b> following {{the tenets of}} his religion was useless, and that he [...] "may as well have stayed home and watched Red Fisher." ...|$|R
6000|$|That made me comfortable, {{and when}} Miss Catherine said, [...] "It's what I think, too," [...] I was {{grateful}} <b>to</b> myself for <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> scrape.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} how Jamie and Pokey used to play Forty Thieves with them, and how you tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> blue one and got stuck, and the other boys found us before I could pull you out?" [...] asked Phebe, laughing.|$|E
60|$|But this didn't explain matters at all. He {{knew that}} the gate had been latched {{when he entered the}} henyard that morning. How had Reddy managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> henyard with that gate closed? To this day, Farmer Brown's boy is still wondering.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{lies between}} us and the inlet, and it's quite clear that we can't stay where we are. Once we got nipped, there'd {{probably}} be an end of her. We have got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> inlet at once or make for the other further south." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{walked on}} beside the water. Stephen spoke quietly, {{looking at the}} ground. [...] "How can I stand clear, old man, {{if you are going}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a mess? <b>That's</b> impossible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{ought to}} have said my fare was drunk, and she came in the way as he was going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the cab. <b>That's</b> what she {{ought to have}} said to begin with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't complain, so far," [...] Grahame {{answered}} cautiously. [...] "The boat, of course, {{does not}} carry much, but her light draught allows her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> harbors <b>that</b> larger vessels can only enter on big tides, and we sold our last cargo at a satisfactory price. Just now I'm {{looking out for}} a few passengers to Kingston; there's no boat across for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{can wait}} till spring. We're very {{comfortable}} in the old place," [...] answered his wife. Then she broke out on him: [...] "What are you {{in such a hurry}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> house for? Do you want to invite the Coreys to a house-warming?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's dead ahead sir," [...] {{answered}} Greenly, smiling; [...] "her orders being {{rather more}} difficult of execution. Her station {{would be off}} yonder to windward, half a league ahead of us; but it's no easy matter <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> position, Sir Gervaise, when the Plantagenet is really in earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{had to do}} it, Molly. It {{was most}} important, in the {{interests}} of hunting generally, that those hounds should not have been allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> covert. I don't think that outsiders ever understand how essential it is to maintain your rights. It isn't as though it were an individual. The whole county may depend upon it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Panthera - Cat-like. Quadruped robot, {{can avoid}} danger more easily, but cannot jump {{as high as}} Triton or Alcedes. Is able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> small spaces <b>that</b> the others cannot. Shoots a blast from {{shoulder}} mounted guns.|$|R

6000|$|... "Doan't 'ee try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> ere cart," [...] he said; [...] "you've {{got to go}} wi' me back to Stokebridge to t' lock-oop {{for hitting}} I and Bess.

6000|$|... "That's the talk!" [...] shouted {{some of the}} loafers. They {{sprang up}} and {{surrounded}} Barney. There was something in his voice that aroused all their latent ferocity. [...] "I'm goin' <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> bank an' see how things look, an' then I'm goin' to find Sanford an' get my money, or pound - out of 'im, one o' the six." ...|$|E
60|$|Here's {{a picture}} of the whole business:--Mamma and Miss Waters are sitting kissing each other in the carriage, with the two girls in the back seat: Waters is driving (a {{precious}} bad driver he is too); and I'm standing at the garden door, and whistling. That old fool Mary Malowney is crying behind the garden gate: she went off next day along with the furniture; and I <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> precious scrape which I shall mention next.|$|E
60|$|Anderson Rover {{heaved a}} deep sigh, which was echoed by his sons. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> down <b>into</b> <b>that</b> mass of rocks a {{distance}} of from one to two hundred feet would surely be a herculean task, if not an impossible one. And then, too, there was a question {{whether or not the}} treasure had not dropped down through some hole {{in the bottom of the}} cave after the earthquake.|$|R
6000|$|... “Not if he {{were really}} a saint, Wilcox. However, don’t {{make up your mind}} that you are not going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your teeth <b>into</b> <b>that</b> junk till I give up the hope of making a fire.” ...|$|R
