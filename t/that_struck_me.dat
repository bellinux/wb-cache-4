500|$|Many {{of these}} {{potential}} identifications {{have been made}} using alleged clues found in Sonnet 86. The second and third quatrains in particular have garnered much attention in this regard. The description of a poet [...] "by spirits taught to write" [...] has led several critics, including Katherine Duncan-Jones and William Minto, to name George Chapman as the likeliest candidate. [...] This is due to his supposed spiritual inspiration by the ghost of Homer. [...] Another scholar, Richard Levin, connects the line [...] "Above a mortal pitch, <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> dead?" [...] to Christopher Marlowe's play Tamburlaine, saying that the reactions described in both are similar to each other.|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, the thing <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> most {{was that the}} characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Claire Zulkey for The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "For me, {{there are}} two types of episodes of 30 Rock: the really really good ones, where all the parts come {{together}} to make a wonderful whole, and the pretty good ones, where there memorable jokes and lines are all there, but put all together create a kind of uneven episode. <b>That</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as tonight's type of episode." [...] Though, Zulkey felt that the zombies scene [...] "didn't really work" [...] except for when Liz smashed a picture frame over Pete Hornberger's (Scott Adsit) head. She said that the [...] "funniest part" [...] from [...] "Flu Shot" [...] was the look on Jack and Elisa's faces [...] "as the animals from The Lion King walked through the audience." [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin D. Thompson, in his review of [...] "Flu Shot", said it featured many funny lines.|$|E
60|$|At first <b>that</b> phrase <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> {{as being}} merely queer, and then I began to realise certain {{possibilities}} that were {{wrapped up in}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think you've heard {{every word}} {{she has said}} to him," [...] Mrs. Pallant {{returned}} with an emphasis <b>that</b> still <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as perverse.|$|R
6000|$|... “And {{he struck}} me—I cannot deny <b>that</b> he <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as {{something}} very big,” pursued the son. “Yes, he is big. He never spoke about himself; only about me. I suppose I admired him. The dreadful part—” ...|$|R
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season. Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t really know the episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So I talked to the director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort of what I was trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E
2500|$|I saw a fresh, new {{conception}} of layout technique <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> like a revelation: pages that [...] "bled" [...] beautifully cropped photographs, typography and design that were bold and arresting. Within ten minutes I had asked Brodovitch to have cocktails with me, and that evening I signed {{him to a}} provisional contract as art director.|$|E
2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think what on earth have we done that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera. And <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as being a dangerous flirtation, and an act of treachery to the people we were born to represent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} <b>that</b> it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{the people}} at home would find that they {{had made a mistake}} after all, and missed a fortune for me! It was an invention for diminishing the fragility of glass under heat; was it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Idiot! Would {{you have}} me believe that iron falls from the sky? I say <b>that</b> you have <b>struck</b> <b>me,</b> you foolish, clumsy-fingered lout." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Forgive me {{and forget}} {{me as soon}} as possible. I am leaving you for ever. Do not look for me, it is useless. I have become a witch from the grief and calamities <b>that</b> have <b>struck</b> <b>me.</b> It's time for me to go. Farewell." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{what struck}} me was his intelligence. His use of angles, length and width of the crease. Also, {{guessing}} what a batsman was likely to do. And the kind of field placing that he is comfortable with. Those are the factors <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> immediately – that this guy not only loves bowling, {{he also has a}} fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here is a guy who knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy. He was pretty clear at 18 itself.|$|E
2500|$|Descendents/All guitarist Stephen Egerton {{described}} Navetta as [...] "a complicated guy, for sure, and [...] {{had a lot}} of frustration. His songs {{most certainly}} bear that out. But he was absurdly generous. He would take his last four bucks and split it with you." [...] Egerton had also said [...] "What struck me about Frank's playing was it reflected very reactionary tendencies -- all downstrokes, all six strings when he could. He didn't really play solos, per se, and there were open chords and minor chords, which was cool in the context of punk. It was {{a very different kind of}} a sound, so the rhythmic intent and pulse, what he was going for, cleaner guitar sound... those were the things <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> overall." [...] All singer Scott Reynolds called him [...] "a very genuine person, crazy in a way that was interesting." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 March 2012, in a {{keynote speech}} to an {{audience}} at the South by Southwest music festival, Bruce Springsteen discussed the Animals' influence on his music at length, stating, [...] "To me, the Animals were a revelation. They were the first records with full-blown class consciousness that I'd ever heard." [...] He said of [...] "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" [...] (written by two New York songwriters, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil): [...] "That's every song I've ever written... That's 'Born to Run,' 'Born in the U.S.A.,' everything I've done for the past 40 years including all the new ones. <b>That</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> so deep. It {{was the first time}} I felt I heard something come across the radio that mirrored my home life, my childhood." [...] Saying that his album Darkness on the Edge of Town was [...] "filled with Animals," [...] Springsteen played the opening riffs to [...] "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" [...] and his own [...] "Badlands" [...] back to back, then said, [...] "Listen up, youngsters! [...] This is how successful theft is accomplished!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was clearly}} Holmes's doing. The Baker Street address {{was enough to}} prove <b>that.</b> It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't {{strangle}} me for <b>that!</b> He never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> {{as such a}} marvellous treasure. There {{is no need to}} be frantic!' ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a note}} of {{only four}} lines--so short and so {{careless}} <b>that</b> it quite <b>struck</b> <b>me.</b> If I remember correctly it contained no more than these words-- ...|$|R
60|$|Ham {{glanced at}} me, and {{suddenly}} I felt a shock <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> back.|$|E
6000|$|I resumed my {{destruction}} of the fungi. Then suddenly I saw something <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> even then. [...] "Cavor," [...] I said, [...] "these chains are of gold!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were there}} three nights last week. What's more, {{you tried to}} draw your next month's wages. <b>That</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as significant, though I'd {{fortunately}} provided against it." ...|$|E
50|$|My {{idea was}} to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. I wanted to use all the {{expressive}} densities that that century conceded to me, and {{for me it was}} a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences <b>that</b> had <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> most.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a thing <b>that</b> only <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> a {{few minutes}} ago, and I'm rather troubled about it," [...] he confessed. [...] "The boys have worked hard enough already without being set to making flapjacks and cooking their supper, while I really don't know how I'm to tide over breakfast to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is entirely}} beyond {{my power to}} {{describe}} the tone in which he made that reply. I can only declare <b>that</b> it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> dumb for the moment. I drew a step nearer to him. With vague misgivings in me, I looked him searchingly in the face. He looked back at me, without shrinking.|$|R
60|$|Oh, how {{grateful}} was {{the breath}} of fresh air <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me!</b> I stumbled out into the clearing and opened wide my throat to take in the pure draught.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And Cristal Nixon--I owe him, too, a day's work in harvest,' said Darsie; 'for I am mistaken {{if he was}} not {{the person}} <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> down when I was made {{prisoner}} among the rioters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{begin to}} be thankful to the leopard <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> down. Well, Nahoon is a brave man, and he has done me a great service. I trust that I {{may be able to}} repay it--to you, Nanea." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have not}} {{tried to give}} the General's language, but only the [...] general idea of what he said. The thing <b>that</b> mainly <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> was [...] his terse remark that the enemy {{originated}} {{the idea of the}} march to [...] the sea. It <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> because it was so suggestive of the General's [...] epigrammatic fashion--saying a great deal in a single crisp [...] sentence. (This is my account, and signed [...] "Mark Twain.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing, I didn't mean that," [...] {{he said to}} {{the absent}} animal. [...] "Hows'ever, I'll try it. Why, I'll make a multiplication-table for myself. Strange that <b>that</b> way never <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Hannah Morrison! She reeled against me; {{and when}} I--such a fool as I was!--pitied her, because I {{was on my}} way home to you, and was {{thinking}} about you and loving you, and was so happy in it, and asked her how she came to <b>that,</b> she <b>struck</b> <b>me,</b> and told me to--to--ask my--husband!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{a little}} perplexed," [...] George owned. [...] "There was {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as different in her manner. It may have been imagination, but I felt she wasn't exactly pleased with me. I can't understand how I have offended her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Myles was too {{blinded by}} his fury {{to see who}} it was that held him. [...] "I will not stop!" [...] he cried, {{struggling}} and striking at the knight. [...] "Let me go! I will have his life <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> when I was down!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering around {{like an old}} bloodhound, and {{babbling}} {{from time to time}} about Berkeley and his cigarette-case in a way <b>that</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as perfectly ghastly. I just stood there, losing weight every moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he wasn't red-headed. You seem interested, sir. I {{thought you}} would be. I will {{tell you all about}} it. I had had my suspicions of this party ever since he arrived. And I may say <b>that</b> it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> at the time that there was {{something}} mighty fishy about the way he got into the castle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more I did," [...] said he. [...] "It's the night-patrol going out. Fact is, I'm {{so used to}} the bloomin' {{evolution}} <b>that</b> {{it never}} <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> to mention it as you might say." ...|$|R
60|$|Richard {{expressed}} himself {{quite sure}} of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out. On his return he told us, more than once, that Vholes was a good fellow, a safe fellow, {{a man who did}} what he pretended to do, a very good fellow indeed! He was so defiant about it <b>that</b> it <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes.|$|R
