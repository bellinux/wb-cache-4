30|$|The way of {{information}} presentation and its content {{should consider the}} <b>transportation</b> <b>mean</b> where the user is on, as well as his/her workload. Technically, {{it has not been}} solved yet and it certainly constitutes an interesting research area. For example, when the user is on the metro, or even the bus, it is possible to lose the satellite signal (GPS) and a WiFi, 3  G, etc. connection might not be available. Then, his/her localisation should be achieved with other means (e.g. use of GSM triangulation, ‘logical’ positioning, hybrid positioning, etc.), which haven’t yet obtained the required reliability and fidelity levels. Similarly, it is very difficult for the service to know the current workload of a traveler (e.g. when he/she is purchasing tickets).|$|R

In this paper, we present a security framework leveraging local and distributed information flow techniques in order to secure the on-board network against internal and external untrusted components. We describe the implementation and integration of such a framework within an IP-based automotive middleware and provide its evaluation...|$|R
