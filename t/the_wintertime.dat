25|$|As Engström {{had a lot}} {{of earlier}} {{experience}} about rolling stock, his contribution on company's railway wagon building was significant. Wagon building balanced <b>the</b> <b>wintertime</b> pits in demand. The main customer was Finnish State Railways and the other customers were private railway operators with the standard 5 ft and narrow gauges. The company produced mainly freight wagons, but also some passenger coaches. The wagon production was ended in 1916, by when the company had built 1,980 closed and 963 open freight wagons and 80 coaches. This makes Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works the second biggest producer of railway wagons in Finland until then, right after the State Railways' Engineering Works.|$|E
25|$|Scores of {{military}} and commercial pilots, flying everything from small bush planes to four-engined turboprops, were {{the backbone of the}} operation. USAF LC-130 aircraft, operated by the 139th Airlift Squadron, provided a significant amount of airlift to sites like Dye 3 that were out on ice caps such as the ones in northern Greenland. C-124 Globemaster and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport planes also supported the project. Together, these provided the only means of access to many of the stations during <b>the</b> <b>wintertime.</b> In all, 460,000 tons of materials were moved from the US and southern Canada to the Arctic by air, land, and sea.|$|E

The letters stated that the town, along with Tiberias and many other villages, had been overthrown. Sidon was damaged considerably, and in Tyre the fallen homes made the streets nearly impassable, with people sleeping in boats and in tents alongside the shore. The village of Rumaish was mostly destroyed, with thirty deaths occurring as people were crushed in their homes, and many more would have suffered the same had they not been at evening prayers at the church there, which was a small building that was not seriously damaged.|$|E

25|$|Up {{to current}} times, {{the site has}} {{continuously}} been augmented, with the first national room, 'the Dutch room' in 1927, and the purchase of additional land in 1929. During World War II, the centre was used to house French soldiers interned for the war. In the 1950s more property was purchased, including the woods by the river Kander, and the centre began to open also in <b>the</b> <b>wintertime.</b> The centre was renamed Kandersteg International Scout Centre in 1977. In the 1980s, new campsites were created, together with extra toilet facilities, although the centre went through a difficult time financially. In 1994, the International Scout Centre Foundation, Kandersteg was established, and work started on the chalet extension project which opened on 1 June 1996. On December 2002, {{the top floor of}} the New Chalet was finished, completing the chalet extension, followed by new bathroom renovations two years later. In 2009, the centre opened a new accommodation building named Kander-Lodge, purchased the neighbouring building, Sunneblick, and fully renovated the ground floor of the Old Chalet.|$|E
25|$|The Przewalski horse's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vegetation. There are many plant species {{in a typical}} Przewalski horse environment including: Elymus repens, Carex spp., Fabaceae, and Asteraceae. While the horses eat {{a variety of different}} plant species, they tend to favor one species during a specific time of the year. In other words, the Przewalski horses have seasonal food preferences. In the springtime, Przewalski horses favor Elymus repens, Corynephorus canescens, Festuca valesiaca, and Chenopodium album. In early summer they favor Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium and in late summer, they gravitate towards Elymus repens and Vicia cracca. In winter, for example, the horses eat Salix spp., Pyrus communis, Malus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Rosa spp., and Alnus spp. Additionally, Przewalski horses may dig for Festuca spp., Bromus inermis and Elymus repens that grow beneath the ice and snow. The Przewalski horse’s winter diet is very similar to the diet of domestic horses. Studies have suggested that in <b>the</b> <b>wintertime,</b> Przewalski horses experience hypodermis. Hypodermis is a condition in which one’s metabolic rate slows down. This means that in the winter time, Przewalski horse’s process their food more slowly than they do during other times of the year. Looking at the species diet overall, however, Przewalski horses most often eat Elymus repens, Trifolium pratense, Vicia cracca, Poa trivialis, Dactylis glomerata and Bromus inermis.|$|E

500|$|Hard {{apple cider}} {{was by far}} the most common {{alcoholic}} beverage available to colonists. This is because apple trees could be grown locally throughout the colonies, unlike grapes and grain which did not grow well at all in New England. Cider was also easier to produce than beer or wine, so it could be made by farmers for their own consumption. Since it was not imported, it was much more affordable to the average colonist than beer or wine. Apple trees were planted in both Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1629. Most of these trees were not grafted, and thus produced apples too bitter or sour for eating; they were planted expressly for making cider. Cider was sometimes also distilled or freeze-distilled into applejack (so called because freeze-distillation was called [...] "jacking"); the cold climate of the Northeast in <b>the</b> <b>wintertime</b> encouraged the process. The beverage was particularly popular in New Jersey, where applejack was occasionally called [...] "Jersey lightning" [...] and was sometimes used to pay road-construction crews.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Crown Fountain, Plensa's {{dominant}} theme {{had been}} dualism, {{which he had}} expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces.

[...] Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations. Because of the colder winters common to the climate of Chicago, Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in <b>the</b> <b>wintertime,</b> so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology.|$|E
