5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to <b>top</b> <b>off</b> the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E
5|$|The Kat {{then began}} an {{on-screen}} rivalry with Terri Runnels, although neither were fully trained wrestlers. At WrestleMania 2000, Runnels (accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah) defeated The Kat (with Mae Young) in a catfight. Val Venis was the special guest referee, {{but he was}} distracted during the match when Young kissed him, which allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring. When Venis saw {{her out of the}} ring, he declared Runnels the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping off her pants to expose her thong. The feud continued, and the duo had an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion. Carter was victorious, but after the match, Runnels pulled The Kat's <b>top</b> <b>off,</b> exposing her breasts, which Carter allowed instead of acting disgusted or embarrassed. The two women continued to feud throughout the summer, often in mixed tag matches. In June 2000, Carter attempted to regain the Women's Championship by entering a battle royal to become the #1 contender, but she was eliminated by her rival Terri. The feud resurfaced in a 'Thong Stink Face' match at SummerSlam, which The Kat won by performing a stinkface on Runnels.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason that}} the train stopped in North Platte was because the town was a {{designated}} tender point for steam trains. Stopping the train allowed for the train crews to relubricate the wheels, <b>top</b> <b>off</b> the water levels in the tanks, and other things for maintenance of the locomotive. This practice continued until the Union Pacific Railroad switched to diesel locomotives.|$|E

25|$|After {{the opening}} exchanges, Réunion lost her fore yard and mizzen topmast while Crescent lost the <b>top</b> <b>off</b> her foremast. Both ships had rigging cut {{and a number}} of sails damaged but Crescent was still able to {{manoeuvre}} across Réunion's stern and rake her. This raking caused huge damage to the French ship and her crew, and although Réunion continued to resist for some time, she was no longer able to move effectively.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November 1946 a Royal Air Force twin-engined Douglas Boston bomber hit {{and ripped}} the <b>top</b> <b>off</b> a bus with its landing gear {{as it was}} on {{approach}} to the airfield.

Seven airman were killed at the scene and one died later, four others were seriously hurt. The aircraft crash landed on the airfield and the crew of three were not injured.|$|E

25|$|With the victory, the Cowboys {{once again}} {{reclaimed}} {{first place in}} their division and improved to 11–5 to <b>top</b> <b>off</b> their regular season. This {{is the first time}} the Cowboys have swept the series since 2005, and also to snap Dallas's 9-regular season finale losing streak, as well as being the first time the Cowboys won a January game since 2000. The Cowboys would face off with the Eagles again in their first game of the playoffs the next week. This is also the first time Dallas posted back to back shutouts and Tony Romo broke his old team record for single season passing. They finished the regular season with an 11–5 record.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in a 3–1 Supercopa de España first-leg victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou. Having {{received}} a yellow card for taking his <b>top</b> <b>off</b> during his goal celebrations, he was sent off for a second yellow card offence minutes later before he shoved the referee lightly to depict his dissatisfaction. He was handed a five-match ban following the game. In his 400th game for Real Madrid, Ronaldo scored two goals against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions league, taking his tally to 411 goals. On 23 October, Ronaldo claimed his fifth FIFA Player of the Year award by receiving The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the season, Perth Wildcats owner Kerry Stokes {{decided to}} pass on the reins of the {{franchise}} to basketball great Luc Longley, fresh off being a three-time NBA championship winner with the Chicago Bulls, and Andrew Vlahov. The new ownership duo proved to be an instant success with the Wildcats securing an unprecedented fourth championship, defeating the Victoria Titans in front of a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the Perth Entertainment Centre. The Wildcats swept the Grand Final series 2–0, winning Game 1 in Melbourne 84–78 before returning home to clinch the series with an 83–76 Game 2 win. After scoring a game-high 27 points in Game 2, Marcus Timmons was named MVP of the series.

With Saumarez about to cross his bow and Circe now rapidly approaching due to a strengthening wind, Dénian realised {{he had no choice but}} to surrender his vessel. The engagement had lasted two hours and ten minutes during which time the cutter Espérance managed to escape to Cherbourg. The French frigate Sémillante, which had been anchored in the harbour, was unable to come to Réunion's rescue because of contrary wind and tides.|$|E

500|$|When the {{aircraft}} were ready, they flew to Iwo Jima and stopped for the night. There they were loaded {{with as much}} fuel as they could hold. It was known that the intended air base in Hokkaidō {{did not have enough}} avgas to fill all three B-29s for the long-distance flight, meaning that at Hokkaidō they could only <b>top</b> <b>off</b> the fuel tanks {{to make up for the}} amount used to fly from Iwo Jima. On September 15, the three aircraft left Iwo Jima, flying north past Okinawa, where the typhoon had blown itself out. They continued to Hokkaidō where the approach involved some apprehension. The Japanese air base had been judged by Colonel William [...] "Butch" [...] Blanchard as suitable for B-29s, with a runway that was long enough and was near sea level for maximum lift in the densest possible air, but it was not known whether it could hold such heavily laden bombers without the concrete cracking. LeMay sent Douglas C-54 Skymasters filled with 55-gallon (210L) drums of avgas to Sapporo—the crewmen would have to <b>top</b> <b>off</b> their tanks by hand.|$|E

500|$|The general {{geological}} {{structure of}} the Peak District {{is that of a}} broad dome, whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded. [...] Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the <b>top</b> <b>off</b> the dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins, Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of Millstone Grit outcropping between them.

500|$|Although briefer {{than the}} two-piece swimsuits of the 1930s, {{the bottom of}} Heim's new two-piece beach costume still covered the wearer's navel. Réard's bikini {{undercut}} Heim's atome in its brevity. His initial design consisted of a bra and two triangular pieces of newspaper-type print fabric connected by strips of material. He sliced the <b>top</b> <b>off</b> Heim's bottoms. The Bikini, with a total area of [...] of cloth, [...] was advertised as [...] "smaller than the smallest swimsuit". When {{he was unable to}} find a model willing to showcase his revealing design, Réard hired Micheline Bernardini, a 19-year old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris.
