5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, concluding that <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> a complex one, {{and that a}} full understanding of individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> {{particularly}} important for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.|$|E
5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} manifestation of the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E

The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm.

25|$|The term is {{especially}} applied historically to Spanish Jews who—outwardly—professed Catholicism, {{who were also}} known as Anusim or Marranos. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> especially associated with renaissance Spain, following the June 6, 1391, Anti-Jewish pogroms and the expulsion of the Jews in 1492.|$|E

50|$|In {{the more}} general use of the word, a causal {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> <b>is</b> implied; <b>the</b> epiphenomenon {{is a consequence of}} <b>the</b> primary <b>phenomenon.</b> This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sense that is related to the noun epiphenomenalism.|$|R

25|$|Some deep-sea pelagic groups, {{such as the}} lanternfish, ridgehead, marine hatchetfish, and lightfish {{families}} are sometimes termed pseudoceanic because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably seamounts and over continental slopes. <b>The</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.|$|E
25|$|Cooling between 2006 and 2008, for instance, {{was likely}} driven by La Niña, the {{opposite}} of El Niño conditions. The area of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures that defines La Niña conditions can push global temperatures downward, if <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> strong enough.

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of mitempfindung {{is difficult to}} determine exactly, because many individuals would not be aware of having referred itch until <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> explained to them. Consequently, variability exists within the scientific literature as to the actual {{prevalence of}} referred itch in humans. Mittelmann (1920) has reported that 8 out of 9 people questioned experienced referred sensations. In 1973, Sterling reported that about half of 20 healthy individuals questioned had mitempfindung.|$|E
25|$|Some lay Catholics {{carry out}} {{full-time}} professional and vocational {{service in the}} name of the Church, rather than in a secular calling. Though <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> widespread in North America and much of Europe, the organization and definition of the ministry is left to national bishops conferences. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has adopted the term lay ecclesial ministry for these individuals, as intentionally distinct from the general apostolate or ministry of the laity described above.|$|E
