5|$|In August 2013, Yelp {{launched}} {{a series of}} town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities {{in an effort to}} address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.|$|E

40|$|With public {{interest}} in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies continuing to grow, {{the question of whether}} virtual currencies are regulated at the Federal level has arisen. The Commodity Futures <b>Trading</b> <b>Commission,</b> in particular, has been aggressive in asserting its regulatory authority over a broad swath of activities and transactions involving virtual currencies. In doing so, the Commodity Futures <b>Trading</b> <b>Commission</b> appears to have taken the position that virtual currency is a commodity and not, for the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory purposes, a currency. This paper analyzes the Commodity Futures <b>Trading</b> <b>Commission</b> 2 ̆ 7 s position with respect to virtual currency and whether it is appropriate for the Commodity Futures <b>Trading</b> <b>Commission</b> to treat virtual currency as a commodity or a currency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how reputational ranking and <b>trading</b> <b>commission</b> incentives influence the forecasting behavior of sell-side analysts. I develop {{a model in}} which two analysts simultaneously forecast a company’s earnings. Each analyst attempts to maximize his compensation, which is a linear combination of his <b>trading</b> <b>commissions</b> and his expected reputational value in the labor market. My main predictions from this model are as follows: (i) Reputational concerns alone do not provide analysts with suffi cient incentive for honest reporting. Indeed, a reputational payoff structure in which the reward for being the only good analyst is suffi ciently larger than the penalty for being the only bad analyst makes the incentive problem even worse. (ii) <b>Trading</b> <b>commissions</b> alone also provide perverse incentive. While, with single analyst, there is no honest reporting, with multiple analysts, the information content of analyst forecasts go up because of the analysts’desire to coordinate. (iii) <b>Trading</b> <b>commissions,</b> together with reputational concerns, provide better incentive for honest reporting than reputational concerns or <b>trading</b> <b>commissions</b> alone.

5|$|Kiwi was {{acquired}} by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 {{to prevent it from}} becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry.

5|$|Before the Columbine High School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal.

On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E

5|$|In {{a dispute}} {{illustrating}} {{the nature of}} claims, defenses, and counterclaims for patent infringement based on arguments of prior art and first to file, rival digital music player maker Creative Technology sued Apple in May 2006 for Apple's alleged infringement of Creative's Zen patent claiming Apple infringed Creative's patent for the menuing structures on an MP3 player. Creative claimed it began using its menuing method on its Nomad players in September 2000, approximately a year prior to Apple's first iPod release in October 2001. Creative, a Singapore-based consumer electronics group, also filed a trade complaint with the United States International <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> (ITC) against Apple. Creative asked for a court injunction to block the import and sale of Apple's iPod and iPod nano in the United States and for money damages for past sales. Apple filed a countersuit against Creative on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|Initially conservative, {{working with}} Wilson (who was elected president) {{inspired}} Barkley {{to become more}} liberal. On April 24, 1912, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> Act. Because of {{his support for the}} administration, he was assigned to the powerful Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House.

He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission,</b> and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal <b>Trade</b> <b>Commission</b> found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
