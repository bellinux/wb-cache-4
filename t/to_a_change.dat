5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if {{they are able to}} successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, group theory helps {{predict the}} changes in {{physical}} properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E

Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement.

Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E
