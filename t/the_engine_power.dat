5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E

25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of this design {{is that when}} steering is applied <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> {{is removed from the}} track. This makes the tank slow down, even if the brake is not applied. If the tank is climbing, or in soft terrain, forward motion may stop entirely. Another disadvantage is that the brakes slowed the vehicle as dissipated heat, which made this concept unsuitable for larger designs which required massive brakes to avoid overheating.|$|E
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused {{primarily}} by the aircraft's automated reaction which was triggered by a faulty radio altimeter. This caused the autothrottle to decrease <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> to idle during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed. Boeing has since issued a bulletin to remind pilots of all 737 series and BBJ aircraft {{of the importance of}} monitoring airspeed and altitude, advising against the use of autopilot or autothrottle while landing in cases of radio altimeter discrepancies.|$|E
25|$|Stirling engine designs require heat {{exchangers}} for heat input and for heat output, and these must contain {{the pressure of}} the working fluid, where the pressure is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> output. In addition, the expansion-side heat exchanger is often at very high temperature, so the materials must resist the corrosive effects of the heat source, and have low creep. Typically these material requirements substantially increase the cost of the engine. The materials and assembly costs for a high temperature heat exchanger typically accounts for 40% of the total engine cost.|$|E

25|$|It {{was clearly}} {{desirable}} to connect central Scotland into the emerging network. At {{first it was}} assumed that only one route from Scotland to England would be feasible, and there was considerable controversy over the possible route. A major difficulty was the terrain of the Southern Uplands: a route running through the hilly lands would involve steep and lengthy gradients that were challenging for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of the time; a route around them, either to the west or the east, involved much lengthier main lines, and made connection to both Edinburgh and Glasgow more problematic.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} – use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp {{on each side}}. Double-rig beam trawlers can tow {{a separate}} trawl {{on each side of}} the trawler. Beam trawling is used in the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|E
25|$|Many {{differentials}} {{have no way}} {{of limiting}} the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of differentials that can either limit the amount of slip (these are called 'limited-slip' differentials) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.|$|E
50|$|Four-wheel-drive systems tend to {{be quite}} heavy and some of <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> <b>power</b> can be lost through the various {{differentials}} in the car, {{in addition to the}} frictional losses of the powertrain.|$|R

50|$|A {{turboprop}} {{engine is}} a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller. In {{contrast to a}} turbojet, <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust, since almost all of <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> <b>power</b> is used to drive the propeller.|$|R
25|$|For the 2006 {{model year}} (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini {{introduced}} many {{changes to the}} car to counter some criticisms garnered from the press and owners. These {{were based on the}} limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter around town), the suspension was revised, a new steering rack was fitted, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> was increased by 20bhp to a maximum of , and the biggest change was an overall lowering of the gearing, especially in 1st to 5th. The result was a much improved car: it handled and turned better, sounded better under full throttle and the extra power and lower gearing made an already fast car into a much faster one.|$|E
25|$|The maximum rpm of a {{propeller}} (at about 2800 {{depending on}} its diameter) {{is about half}} that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500rpm for a car engine and these engines therefore need to be fitted with a drive reduction unit. Such units absorb about 20% of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the Jabiru 5100. Recent developments of the Jabiru engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the nose cowling of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be {{in keeping with the}} original sleek design of the Spitfire. First flights of a Mk26 with the redeveloped water-cooled Jabiru 5100 are expected in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Karluk {{had been}} chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000. Stefansson was advised by Pedersen that, of four ships that were available, Karluk was [...] "the soundest and best adapted for our purpose", but Bartlett had deep {{reservations}} about her fitness for prolonged Arctic service. The ship, a 29-year-old brigantine, was [...] in length with a beam of [...] She had been built for the Aleutian fishing industry (karluk is the Aleut word for [...] "fish") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with [...] Australian ironwood. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, {{she had not been}} built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> to force a passage through the ice. She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew.|$|E
50|$|The PAV has flight {{characteristics}} {{similar to other}} Carter aircraft. When stationary on <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>powers</b> up <b>the</b> flat pitch rotor to 370 RPM, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is then disengaged from the rotor to provide full power to the propeller.|$|R
50|$|In {{relation}} to similar aircraft of the time, assembly was very easy, and this {{made it a}} very popular aircraft. According to the sales brochures, only 25% of <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> <b>power</b> was {{needed to keep the}} aircraft flying, compared to biplanes of the period, which required 50% <b>engine</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before <b>the</b> {{integration}} of <b>engines</b> in ships, <b>the</b> maritime professions consisted of deck department jobs. This was {{because there was}} no engine for engineers to work on. The type of propulsion used before <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> paddle wheel was wind power.|$|R
500|$|The {{investigation}} found {{that as the}} B-52 entered its final turn sequence around the tower, its indicated airspeed (IAS) was [...] Although Holland increased <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> after starting the turn, his input came too late to maintain the aircraft's airspeed, as the B-52 turbofan engines take up to eight seconds to respond to throttle commands. Even though the airspeed indicator was available to all four aircrew members, the aircraft's airspeed was allowed to continue to decrease. Eight seconds before impact, the aircraft's IAS had deteriorated to [...] and the aircraft's bank angle increased past 60°. At this time Holland or McGeehan applied full right spoiler, right rudder, and nose-up elevator, and the aircraft entered a turning flight stall (also called accelerated stall). This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which always refers to {{straight and level flight}} – because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was [...] Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E
500|$|The new {{streamlined}} low-wing monoplane {{design was}} to have a retractable undercarriage. Like the IK-2 it was initially developed privately by Ilić and Sivčev. A scale model was tested in the Eiffel-built wind tunnel in Paris, but the pair soon realised that they needed a third engineer to help with evaluating the design and determining the structural details. Slobodan Zrnić, the head of construction at the Yugoslav State Aircraft Factory in Kraljevo, was recruited, as he had worked as a specialist aircraft engineer in France. The project name for the IK-2 was changed from IK, standing for (Ljubomir) Ilić and Kosta (Sivčev), to IKZ, to include Zrnić. This name was changed, possibly due to the similarities between the Cyrillic [...] "З" [...] (Z) and the Arabic numeral [...] "3", and the aircraft became known as the IK-3. The aircraft was to be powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Y29 engine, generating [...] at [...] The designers chose to favour manoeuvrability over speed, trying to find a compromise between the German and British concepts of a modern monoplane fighter. The design had a smaller wing area than the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire, to achieve a relatively higher speed for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power.</b> In comparison to the Messerschmitt Bf109, the Yugoslav design had a shorter fuselage and smaller turning radius. It differed from British and German design concepts in that its proposed armament was concentrated in the fuselage.|$|E
