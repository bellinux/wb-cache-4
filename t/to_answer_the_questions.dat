5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

International variants have aired in around 160 countries worldwide. The show's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time (similar to some radio quizzes), and {{the emphasis is on}} suspense rather than speed. In most versions there are no time limits <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> and contestants are given the question before they must decide whether to attempt an answer.|$|E
25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They asked whether the president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president had <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E

500|$|After the 1976 Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History {{meeting and}} the {{publication}} of Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community in 1978, Blassingame produced a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community in 1979. In the new preface, Blassingame asserted that the book had to be revised because of George Bentley, an enslaved, pro-slavery Primitive Baptist minister from Tennessee who pastored a white church in the 1850s. Blassingame wanted to [...] "solve the myriad dilemmas posed by George Bentley", but he also wanted <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> challenges, and critiques raised by scholars since {{the publication of}} The Slave Community.|$|E
500|$|The Stanley {{plan also}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. [...] This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the [...] "Thomson Committee" [...] after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to answer some of these questions, and the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E
500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E

We must consciously choose <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> confronting us. Today's question is civil society ... I believe we can easily reconstruct civil society here (in Iran) based on our own values and cultural characteristics. Civil society is a necessity, and the growing complexity of society requires it. Our historical past also supports it. In reality, in Iran, as in elsewhere in the Middle East, the only obstacle to civil society is the state." [...] Mesbah Yazdi, however, stated: [...] "It doesn’t matter what the people think. The people are ignorant sheep." ...|$|E

In the month before the hearing of that prosecution, commencing in April 2011, Melbourne Steamship was directed to answer various questions about its involvement in the Coal Vend. Melbourne Steamship resisted answering the questions, in which the Crown Solicitor's office stated that the answers were needed {{for the purposes of}} the prosecution of the original shipping companies. Moorehead, represented by Starke, prosecuted Melbourne Steamship, represented by Mitchell [...] before a Police Magistrate, charged with failing <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in the time given.

Neither psychiatrist had examined Barefoot nor asked to do so, but each summarized their professional experience as equipping them <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> accurately. One psychiatrist called Barefoot a [...] "criminal sociopath" [...] and {{said there was no}} treatment for this condition and that Barefoot was likely to commit acts of violence in the future.

[...] In 1986, Behr interviewed one of Puyi's two surviving eunuchs, an 85year-old man who proved reluctant <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> asked of him, but finally stated about Puyi's relationship with Wanrong: [...] "The Emperor would come over to the nuptial apartments once every three months and spend the night there ...

[...] Reginald Johnston arranged for the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun, a descendant of the Ming dynasty Imperial family, to visit Puyi in the Forbidden City in September1924, which was the first time the heirs of both the deposed Ming and Qing dynasties came face to face.|$|E

[...] The letter also demanded answers to four specific questions about how Penn State had complied with NCAA policies during that time. [...] Penn State pledged full cooperation, but asked to defer its response until after the release of the Freeh report. [...] On July 16, Emmert appeared on PBS' Tavis Smiley and said that with the release of the Freeh report, Penn State had [...] "weeks, not months" [...] <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> he'd raised in the November letter. [...] He also hinted that he had not ruled out issuing the so-called [...] "death penalty", which would have forced Penn State to cancel at least the 2012 season. [...] The NCAA had not handed down a death penalty to a Division I school since Southern Methodist University was hit with it in 1987 for massive violations in its football program. [...] Although the NCAA is required to consider handing down a death penalty if a school commits two major violations within five years, it has the power to shut down a program without any preliminary sanctions in the event of particularly egregious misconduct.|$|E
