5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E
5|$|France2 {{appealed to}} the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>should</b> not have asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>should</b> abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to {{the use of military force}} and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E
50|$|In theory, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> {{always been}} {{impartial}} and independent from any interference. Judges were not elected through election, but {{the members of}} the Legislative Council were. Thus, the Legislative Council would be in a better position than <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> to determine what the society would need. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> recognise and appreciate that fact. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> let <b>the</b> legislature deal with public policy. And this would be the margin of appreciation doctrine.|$|R
500|$|The Act was [...] "a {{compromise}} between two opposing jurisprudential approaches to arbitration...that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> be {{kept out of}} arbitration altogether except to prevent abuses against the rules of natural justice, [...] that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> retain a substantial measure of control over arbitrations to ensure that arbitral awards apply the law".|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> {{recognize}} that defense counsel’s role is pivotal {{in criminal cases}} and take specific steps to strengthen the defendant’s right to counsel. The article first examines the courts’ view of the criminal defendant’s role in four situations: when addressing questions of competency to stand trial, when addressing the propriety of excluding the defendant from various proceedings, when considering the allocation of decision-making authority between the defendant and counsel, and when discussing {{the responsibility of the}} pro se defendant. In each of these contexts, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> generally ascribe a limited role to the represented defendant, relying on counsel to protect and enforce the defendant’s rights. The article then argues that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> take four steps to strengthen the defendant’s right to counsel. First, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> recognize a constitutionally protected interest in continuity of representation. Second, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> be more receptive to motions for substitute counsel. Third, <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> assure that <b>the</b> defendant is present at all discussions related to whether counsel will continue in the case. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> recognize <b>the</b> unusual responsibility assumed by a pro se defendant and enforce rules disfavoring the decision to proceed pro se. These procedural changes would enhance the fairness of the criminal process by strengthening the defendant’s right to counsel...|$|R
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>should</b> not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2012, Justice Ginsburg {{denied the}} motion, citing Doe v. Gonzales, {{which states that}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> {{hesitate}} to interfere with an appeals court that was proceeding on an expedited schedule to review a ruling against a federal law, and that, in any event, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> be cautious when such a law had been nullified in a lower court.|$|E
25|$|The Court ruled 7-1 in the government's favor, affirming much of {{the consent}} decree (Justice Robert H. Jackson took no part in the proceedings). William O.

25|$|This was {{the most}} closely decided issue in the case. The {{arguments}} presented by counsel did not extensively address what <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> do if the Court were to find an Equal Protection violation.

25|$|If {{the court}} refused to grant such an application, then the {{defendant}} would (quite obviously) {{be unable to}} cross examine the makers of the hearsay statements.

5000|$|The Government {{argued that}} {{whenever}} {{there would be}} constitutional challenges on primary legislation, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> follow <b>the</b> margin of appreciation doctrine and let the Legislative Council handle the matters.

25|$|Brandeis cites an old maxim of unclean hands, {{inherited}} from courts of equity, whereby a court will not redress a wrong when he who has requested its aid has unclean hands.

25|$|He {{claimed that}} it was not {{entitled}} to the deference the Court accorded agencies of the executive branch. It was not, he said, a reasonable interpretation of the National Banking Act and thus, per the rule it had established in the 1984 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. case, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> review it afresh and rule on whether it was the best interpretation of the statute.|$|E
25|$|The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association {{argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>should</b> look beyond mere {{dictionary}} definitions of “sewer” {{to examine the}} legal {{meaning of the term}} in the specific context of how that term is used in Proposition 218. The Association also observed that numerous California statutes differentiated between storm drainage and sewerage systems, including a specific statute that legally authorizes many local governments to levy fees and charges for storm drainage or sewerage systems.|$|E
25|$|Brandeis recited {{traditional}} Article III jurisprudence {{by recognizing}} well-established constitutional {{limits on the}} federal judicial power. The concurrence's theme of judicial restraint is not inconsistent with the plurality's decision: a federal court should only decide an actual Article III controversy when the facts present one, and should refuse to render an advisory opinion on the entire TVA program. Brandeis then relied on the avoidance doctrine to argue that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> not reach {{the merits of the}} constitutional issue.|$|E

This {{is not to say that}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> not, where circumstances require, consider the need for development of the common law of New Zealand in relation to the reciprocal fiduciary obligations that the Crown and Maori owe to each other.
