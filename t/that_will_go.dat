25|$|Adults of C. cadaverina {{lay their}} eggs in open wounds or natural body {{openings}} on carrion, typically in small clusters or scattered singly. The eggs usually hatch out within 24 to 72 hours depending on the season. The eggs will then hatch into larvae <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> through three instars (stages). Each one of these stages is separated by a molt. During a molt, the larvae shed its outer layer {{in order to accommodate}} for new growth that comes with increased consumption of food needed for energy stores. The first instar typically lasts for approximately 20 hours, while the second instar lasts for 16 hours followed by the third instar for 72 hours. After the larvae have completed their development and stored as much energy as possible, they disperse to a safe area to complete their next stage, the pupal stage. This stage lasts for about 9 days before the fly finally emerges as an adult. The total lifecycle of C. cadaverina can take anywhere from 17–19 days depending on the temperature.|$|E

The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release.
