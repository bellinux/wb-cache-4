40|$|Radiation dose {{delivered}} {{from the}} SCANORA radiography unit during the cross-sectional mode for dentotangential projections was determined. With regard to oral implantology, patient situations of an edentulous maxilla and mandible {{as well as}} a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in regions 16 and 46 were simulated. Radiation doses were measured between 0. 2 and 22. 5 mGy to organs and tissues {{in the head and neck}} region when the complete maxilla or mandible was examined. When examining a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap,</b> only 8 % to 40 % of that radiation dose was generally observed. Based on these results, the mortality risk was estimated according to a calculation model recommended by the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations. The mortality risk ranged from 31. 4 x 10 (- 6) for 20 -year-old men to 4. 8 x 10 (- 6) for 65 -year-old women when cross-sectional imaging of the complete maxilla was performed. The values decreased by 70 % when a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in the molar region of the maxilla was radiographed. The figures for the mortality risk for examinations of the complete mandible were similar to those for the complete maxilla, but the mortality risk decreased by 80 % if only a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in the molar region of the mandible was examined. Calculations according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection carried out for comparison did not reveal the decrease of the mortality risk with age and resulted in a higher risk value in comparison to the group of 35 -year old individuals in calculations according to the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations...|$|R
30|$|This {{analysis}} {{was based on}} the radiographic (i.e., cone-beam computed tomographic—CBCT) data derived from a prospective controlled clinical monocenter study including a total of 30 patients [9]. Each participant exhibited either a <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> or a free-end situation with an inadequate horizontal ridge width and was in need of an implant-supported fixed restoration.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} {{demonstrated}} that early implant loading was non-inferior to conventional implant loading {{in terms of}} crestal bone level change in a Japanese patient population in short follow-up period and single <b>tooth</b> <b>gaps</b> in molar regions. High implant survival and patient satisfaction rates, and a good safety profile, were also achieved.|$|R

30|$|Regarding the {{alveolar}} crest situation preoperatively, 163 defects {{were recorded}} as single-tooth gap, 119 as free-ending dental arch, and 79 as <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> involving {{more than one}} tooth. Edentulism was observed in 19 of the cases. Three hundred one bone harvesting procedures were performed for augmentation of the maxilla and 155 for the mandible.|$|R
30|$|Patients were {{enrolled}} according to strict pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most important inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 20  years, single <b>tooth</b> <b>gaps</b> in molar or premolar in the mandible or maxilla, bone quality I–III and sufficient bone quantity to allow implant placement, and substantially healed extraction sockets (at least 16  weeks after tooth extraction).|$|R

50|$|The labial {{frenulum}} often {{attaches to}} the center of the upper lip and between the upper two front teeth. This can cause a large gap and gum recession by pulling the gums off the bone. A labial frenectomy removes the labial frenulum. Orthodontic patients often have this procedure done to assist with closing a front <b>tooth</b> <b>gap.</b> When a denture patient's lips move, the frenulum pulls and loosens the denture which can be uncomfortable. This surgery is often done to help dentures fit better.|$|R

The model of demand for money in Czech Republic created by real M 2, real GDP and 1 R PRIBOR time series contains two common trends. These trends are estimated from the state space form of unobservable components model. The gap transformations of real M 2 and real GDP series can be used for identification of inflation risks.

In middle school, Wixson was bullied, having her <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> called a [...] "parking lot", making her self-conscious about her looks. At 12 years old and 5'7", strangers would come up to her to tell her she could be a model, so she started researching it as a possible career. Around the same time, she was inspired by an article in the Reader's Digest about Bill Gates and other millionaires, stating that [...] "it was talking about how they took the chance and they took their opportunities and they took it to a whole other level". Wixson decided to become a model, and studied old copies of Vogue, looking at the careers of supermodels like Gisele, Christy and Kate. Wixson first signed with a local agent in Kansas, but had no success, so her parents made the decision to take out a loan and drive down to Los Angeles.|$|R
