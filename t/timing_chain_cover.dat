50|$|For the 1992 model year, the 4.3L had its {{block design}} {{modified}} {{to allow a}} balance shaft to be installed. Even though the 4.3L is an even fire V6, the 90-degree block layout is not ideal for smoothness. The balance shaft on the 4.3L is installed above the top timing gear, and runs through {{the top of the}} lifter valley. It is gear driven off the timing chain, and therefore a new <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> was designed for these balanced 4.3L V6s. Balance shaft engines do not have provisions for a mechanical fuel pump unlike the non-balance shaft motors which retained the cast in boss.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{versions}} of the 2AZ-FE engine were upgraded with 9.8:1 compression ratio, a slightly more aggressive intake cam profile, 6500 rpm red line, and piston oil squirters. These later versions are rated at [...] in the Scion tC, [...] in the Rav4, and [...] in the Camry, Corolla XRS, and Scion xB. However, these latter 2AZ-FE models {{were the first to}} be rated under the new SAE J1349 standard. The new standard usually produces more conservative numbers, though no definitive comparison is available since the two versions were never tested by the same standard.The Rav 4 uses a different <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> than the Camry, they can however be interchanged.|$|E
5000|$|The small-block {{engine that}} was {{identified}} as the Windsor engine {{was introduced in the}} 1962 Ford Fairlane. Displacing 221 cuin L, it was designed to save weight, using thin-wall casting with a block that does not extend below the centerline of the crankshaft. The engine uses a separate aluminum <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover,</b> which differentiates it from the later 335-series Cleveland engines that use an integrated timing cover. All Windsor engines use two-valve-per-cylinder heads, with [...] "2V" [...] and [...] "4V" [...] designations indicating the number of barrels (or venturi) in the carburetor. The valves are in-line and use straight six-bolt valve covers. Coolant is routed into the block by the intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, {{the engine}} was {{significantly}} reworked, output was up to 114 hp (84 kW) at 4,800 rpm and 140 lb·ft (190 N·m) at 3,600 rpm. Many parts from the newer 22R-E are not compatible with those from the older pre-1985 engine. Non-compatible parts include the cylinder head, block, pistons {{and many of the}} associated parts such as the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> and <b>cover,</b> and water and oil pumps (although the oil pump internals are the same).These changes also affected the 22R, therefore one can consider the 85-95 22R-E as a fuel injected version of the 85-90 22R with only minor differences, if any.|$|R
50|$|The GA16DE is a 1.6 litre (1597 cc) engine {{produced}} from November 1990 through 1999. All GA16DEs have sixteen valves and a DOHC head. There are three versions: the North-American first-generation (1991-94) NVCS (VTC), which produces 110 hp (80 kW) at 6000 rpm and 110 lb·ft (146 Nm) at 4000 rpm, the North-American second-generation (1995-1999) NVCS (VTC), which produces 115 hp (85 kW) at 6000 rpm and 110 lb·ft (146 Nm) at 4000 rpm, and a non-NVCS version (European-spec) which makes 102 hp (76 kW). The two variants of the North American NVCS engine are distinguished as such: {{in addition to}} differences in the intake manifolds and (resultantly) the heads, earlier motors used pistons with two compression rings and a single oil ring and put out five less horsepower, while later GA16DEs have a single compression ring and a single oil ring. The GA16DE shares its block and crankshaft with its predecessor, the GA16i; however, their <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>covers,</b> connecting rods and pistons are altogether different. It is possible to interchange connecting-rod/piston assemblies between the GA16i and GA16DE with no danger to the valve train. Some engines have siamesed exhaust manifolds, while others keep the exhausts separated until the catalytic converter. Earlier ECUs contained the fuel & ignition maps on a discrete ROM IC, making retuning relatively easy, later ECUs buried the maps on a larger more integrated microcontroller's firmware, making retuning {{require the use of}} a daughterboard.|$|R
50|$|The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was {{hydraulic}} tensioned and had {{a ratchet}} mechanism to keep the <b>chain</b> tight. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> guide in between the camshaft sprockets. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> sets.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability. This led to elimination of coolant flowing through the intake manifold to prevent unnecessary heat transfer. To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions for the coolant to flow through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated timing chain housing. The timing chain housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> used on other Ford V8s. These changes resulted in a bigger and heavier engine block than the Windsor V8s. The 351 Cleveland was not an all-new design, but a development of the 351W into a higher-performance variation.|$|E
50|$|Harmonic Balancer - Some M112 and M113 engines used in W210 {{models were}} {{equipped}} with a harmonic balancer pulley which, due to a supplier quality problem, may fail and cause engine damage. If the rubber insert of the harmonic balancer pulley delaminates, the pulley may grind through the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> and oil pan, causing several thousand dollars of damage. Mercedes-Benz USA issued Service Campaign #2005-020003 which included inspection of the part and replacement if necessary at no cost. The part number on the harmonic balancer pulley {{can be compared to}} those given to Mercedes-Benz dealers in the Service Campaign notice to determine if the part is a faulty original or has been replaced with the updated part. Replacement of the faulty part with the updated part should be a permanent solution to this problem.|$|E
50|$|All 335 Series V8s {{shared the}} same 4.38 in bore spacing and {{cylinder}} head bolt pattern as the Windsor V8s. Beyond these shared aspects, the 335 Series engines are very different internally from the somewhat similar-looking Windsor series. The 335 series V8s use smaller 14mm spark plugs and the radiator hose locations differ between the Windsor and 335 engines. The Windsor engines route coolant through the intake manifold, with the hose protruding horizontally, while the 335 engines had a dry manifold with the radiator hose connecting vertically to the cylinder block above the cam <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover.</b> The Cleveland has a square-shaped rocker cover while the Windsor has a more rounded cover. All 335 covers are secured with eight bolts; the Windsor uses six bolts. All of the 335 series engines differ from the Windsor engines by having a roughly 2-inch extension {{at the front of}} the block which forms an integrated timing cover casting.|$|E

50|$|The VH41DE {{also used}} a double row <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{compared}} to the VH45DE that used a single row <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> Its alternator is also located {{at the top of}} the engine which creates an overall narrower engine package which can be handy in engine conversions where it may otherwise foul on the chassis rails.|$|R
5000|$|Alfa Romeo's Twin Spark {{technology}} used dual ignition to fire two spark plugs in the cylinder head of each piston bore and {{was first used}} in the A.L.F.A. Grand Prix car of 1914. Racing versions of the Giulia engine, including the engine used in the GTA, featured a cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder. Twin Spark versions of the Twin Cam were also developed for 1750 and 2000 models used for racing. In 1987 the model 75 was fitted with a Twin Spark head, which provided improved fuel ignition and allowed an improved combustion chamber shape with narrower angle between intake and exhaust valve. Although developed from the Twin Cam, few if any parts are interchangeable between Twin Spark engines and Twin Cams. For instance, while Twin Cams have six oilways leading to the cylinder head the Twin Sparks only have two, the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover</b> is narrowed and the included angle between the valves is down to a 46°. The Twin Spark engine in the 75 also employed Alfa's variatore di fase VVT system which, when combined with electronic fuel injection, gave a power output of [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>cover.</b> The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s oil ring. Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the oil ring and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the oil ring tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|E
50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{also called}} a sync chain, {{is used on}} tandem bicycles, to {{synchronize}} crank movement between the captain (front rider) and stoker (rear rider). As with auto engines, proper tension of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> is necessary to prevent premature wear of the drivetrain components. Tension is adjusted {{by means of an}} eccentric bottom bracket.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} the necessary {{tension on the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> many tandems use an eccentric that {{is placed in the}} front rider's bottom bracket shell. An alternate solution is to implement a pulley, or idler, {{on the bottom of the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to take up slack. Idlers add friction and a potential point of failure to the drive train.|$|R

50|$|The {{second most}} popular solution, due to not {{requiring}} tandem-specific cranks is called single side rear drive. The forward crankset is {{connected by a}} right-side <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to the rear crankset, {{which in turn is}} connected by a right-side chain to the rear wheel. This requires that one of the rear chainrings be devoted to the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> and limits shifting options.|$|R

50|$|A <b>timing</b> belt, <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the <b>timing</b> belt or <b>chain</b> is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A timing belt is usually a toothed belt -- a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> is a roller chain.|$|R

50|$|The 116.960 {{engine was}} {{introduced}} in 1979 featuring 8.3:1 compression with 158 PS (116 kW; 155 hp) @ 4750rpm and 266 N·m (196 lb·ft) @ 2750rpm. This engine reached North America later for the 1981 380SL. There were 116.961, 116.962, and 116.963 versions of this engine. Early models came with a single row <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> until 1983 and were plagued with chain failure problems which Mercedes-Benz would repair free of charge, changing the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to a dual row thus resolved the problem making these engine as durable and reliable as any other Mercedes V8.

5000|$|Early {{models of}} the M42 {{experienced}} failures of a profile gasket sealing the lower cam chain case to {{the underside of the}} cylinder head.

A significant failure would thus discharge pressurized steam and hot coolant into the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> case. In many cases this coolant rapidly contaminates the motor oil in the sump, causing main bearing failure. BMW updated the profile gasket material and instituted a program to repair motors under warranty. In extreme cases, the aluminum mating surfaces in the head and chain case would corrode.|$|R
