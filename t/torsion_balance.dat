5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a <b>torsion</b> <b>balance</b> into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E

The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument.

25|$|The classic {{experiment}} {{to measure the}} strength of a gravitational source (i.e. its active mass) was first conducted in 1797 by Henry Cavendish (Fig.5‑9a). Two small but dense balls are suspended on a fine wire, making a <b>torsion</b> <b>balance.</b> Bringing two large test masses close to the balls introduces a detectable torque. Given the dimensions of the apparatus and the measurable spring constant of the torsion wire, the gravitational constant G can be determined.|$|E
25|$|The {{experiment}} was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a <b>torsion</b> <b>balance</b> apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston {{and then to}} Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan. Cavendish then carried {{out a series of}} measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1798.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in 1785, the French {{physicist}} Charles-Augustin de Coulomb {{published his}} first three reports of electricity and magnetism where he stated his law. This publication was essential {{to the development of}} the theory of electromagnetism.

25|$|Besides Lorentz {{violations}} due to {{a preferred}} frame or influences based on Mach's principle, spontaneous violations of Lorentz invariance and CPT symmetry are also being searched for, motivated by the predictions of various quantum gravity models that suggest their existence. Modern updates of the Hughes–Drever experiments have been conducted studying possible Lorentz and CPT violation in neutrons and protons. Using spin-polarized systems and co-magnetometers (to suppress magnetic influences), the accuracy and sensitivity of these experiments have been greatly increased. In addition, by using spin-polarized <b>torsion</b> <b>balances,</b> the electron sector has also been tested.|$|R
25|$|The {{equivalence}} principle, in its simplest form, {{asserts that}} the trajectories of falling bodies in a gravitational field should be independent of their mass and internal structure, provided they are small enough not to disturb the environment or be affected by tidal forces. This idea has been tested to extremely high precision by Eötvös <b>torsion</b> <b>balance</b> experiments, which look for a differential acceleration between two test masses. Constraints on this, and {{on the existence of}} a composition-dependent fifth force or gravitational Yukawa interaction are very strong, and are discussed under fifth force and weak equivalence principle.|$|E
25|$|Following his father's death, Henry bought {{another house}} {{in town and}} also a house in Clapham Common, {{at that time to}} the south of London. The London house {{contained}} the bulk of his library, while he kept most of his instruments at Clapham Common, where he carried out most of his experiments. The most famous of those experiments, published in 1798, was to determine the density of the Earth and became known as the Cavendish experiment. The apparatus Cavendish used for weighing the Earth was a modification of the <b>torsion</b> <b>balance</b> built by Englishman and geologist John Michell, who died before he could begin the experiment. The apparatus was sent in crates to Cavendish, who completed the experiment in 1797–1798 and published the results.|$|E
25|$|Using this equipment, Cavendish {{calculated}} the attraction between the balls {{from the period}} of oscillation of the <b>torsion</b> <b>balance,</b> and then he used this value to calculate {{the density of the}} Earth. Cavendish found that the Earth's average density is 5.48 times greater than that of water. John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5.448, and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper. What was extraordinary about Cavendish’s experiment was its elimination of every source of error and every factor that could disturb the experiment and its precision in measuring an astonishingly small attraction, a mere 1/50,000,000 of the weight of the lead balls. The result that Cavendish obtained for the density of the Earth is within 1 percent of the currently accepted figure.|$|E

25|$|By {{this kind}} of {{spectroscopy}} experiments – sometimes called Hughes–Drever experiments as well – violations of Lorentz invariance in the interactions of protons and neutrons are tested by studying the energy levels of those nucleons {{in order to find}} anisotropies in their frequencies ("clocks"). Using spin-polarized <b>torsion</b> <b>balances,</b> also anisotropies with respect to electrons can be examined. Methods used mostly focus on vector spin interactions and tensor interactions, and are often described in CPT odd/even SME terms (in particular parameters of bμ and cμν). Such experiments are currently the most sensitive terrestrial ones, because the precision by which Lorentz violations can be excluded lies at the 10−33 GeV level.|$|R
25|$|Michell {{devised a}} <b>torsion</b> <b>balance</b> for {{measuring}} {{the mass of the}} Earth, but died before he could use it. His instrument passed into the hands of his lifelong friend Henry Cavendish, who first performed in 1798 the experiment now known as the Cavendish Experiment. Placing two 1-kg lead balls at the ends of a six-foot rod, he suspended the rod horizontally by a fibre attached to its centre. Then he placed a massive lead ball beside each of the small ones, causing a gravitational attraction that led the rod to turn clockwise. By measuring the rod’s movement, Cavendish was able to calculate the force exerted by each of the large balls on the 1-kg balls. From these calculations, he was able to provide an accurate estimate of the gravitational constant and of the mass and average density of the Earth. Cavendish gave Michell full credit for his accomplishment.|$|E
25|$|Early {{attempts}} to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force {{were made in}} the mid-18th century. It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by Johann Tobias Mayer and others in 1760, and electrically charged objects, by Henry Cavendish in 1762, obeyed an inverse-square law. However, in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive. It was not until 1784 when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, using a <b>torsion</b> <b>balance,</b> was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true. Soon after the discovery in 1820 by H. C. Ørsted that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, André-Marie Ampère that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the angular dependence of the force between two current elements. In all these descriptions, the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields.|$|E

The solvent environment {{plays an important role}} in determining the geometry and stability of interactions. This thesis examines aromatic stacking interactions, alkyl-alkyl interactions, edge-to-face aromatic interactions, halogen bonds and hydrogen…hydrogen interactions in solution. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the different classes of non-covalent interactions, in addition to the state-of-the-art models and methods for investigating these weak interactions. The chapter finishes with a focus on dispersion interaction in alkanes and arenes. Chapter 2 investigates dispersion interactions between stacked aromatics in solution using a new class of complexes and thermodynamic double mutant cycles (DMCs). In extended aromatics, dispersion was detected as providing a small but significant contribution to the overall stacking free energies. Chapter 3 concerns the experimental measurement of alkyl-alkyl dispersion interactions in a wide range of solvents using Wilcox <b>torsion</b> <b>balances.</b> The contribution of dispersion interactions to alkyl-alkyl association was shown to be very small, with DMC, QSPR method and Hunter's solvation model. Chapter 4 studies edge-to-face aromatic interactions in series of solvents. In the open system, edge-to-face aromatic interactions were found to be sensitive to the solvent environment.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} work {{suggests that}} {{violation of the}} equivalence principle might be revealed in a measurement of the fractional differential acceleration eta between two test bodies-of different compositions, falling in the gravitational field of a source mass-if the measurement is made {{to the level of}} eta similar or equal to 10 (- 13) or better. This being within the reach of ground based experiments gives them a new impetus. However, while slowly rotating <b>torsion</b> <b>balances</b> in ground laboratories are close to reaching this level, only an experiment performed in a low orbit around the Earth is likely to provide a much better accuracy. We report on the progress made with the "Galileo Galilei on the ground" (GGG) experiment, which aims to compete with <b>torsion</b> <b>balances</b> using an instrument design also capable of being converted into a much higher sensitivity space test. In the present and following articles (Part I and Part II), we demonstrate that the dynamical response of the GGG differential accelerometer set into supercritical rotation-in particular, its normal modes (Part I) and rejection of common mode effects (Part II) -can be predicted by means of a simple but effective model that embodies all the relevant physics. Analytical solutions are obtained under special limits, which provide the theoretical understanding. A simulation environment is set up, obtaining a quantitative agreement with the available experimental data on the frequencies of the normal modes and on the whirling behavior. This is a needed and reliable tool for controlling and separating perturbative effects from the expected signal, as well as for planning the optimization of the apparatus.

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, only {{pendulum}} apparatuses and <b>torsion</b> <b>balances</b> were available for general exploration work. Both of these early techniques were cumbersome and time-consuming. It was no wonder that the development of the gravity meter was welcomed with a universal sigh of relief. By 1935 potential field measurements with gravity meters supplanted gradient measurements with <b>torsion</b> <b>balances.</b> Potential field measurements are generally characterized by three types: absolute - measurements are made in fundamental units, traceable to national standards of length and time at each observation site; relative with absolute scale - differences in gravity are measured in fundamental units traceable to national standards of length and time; and relative - differences in gravity are measured with arbitrary scale. Improvements in the design of gravity meters since their introduction has led to a significant reduction in size and greatly increased precision. As the precision increased, applications expanded to include the measurement of crustal motion, the search for non-Newtonian forces, archeology, and civil engineering. Apart from enhancements to the astatic gravity meter, few developments in hardware were achieved. One of these was the vibrating string gravity meter which was developed in the 1950 s and was employed briefly for marine and borehole applications. Another is the cryogenic gravity meter which utilizes the stability of superconducting current to achieve a relative instrument with extremely low drift suitable for tidal and secular gravity measurements. An advance in performing measurements from a moving platform was achieved with the development of the straight-line gravity meter. The latter part of the century also saw the rebirth of gradient measurements which offers advantages for observations from a moving platform. Definitive testing of the Bell gradiometer was recently reported...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of testing the equivalence principle (EP) in the gravitational field of the Earth from the orbits of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites, which are very accurately tracked from ground by laser ranging. The orbital elements that are affected by an EP violation {{and can be used}} to measure the corresponding dimensionless parameter eta are semimajor axis and argument of pericenter. We show that the best result is obtained from the semimajor axis, and it is limited-with all available ranging data to LAGEOS and LAGEOS II-to eta similar or equal to 2 x 10 (- 9), more than 3 orders of magnitude worse than experimental results provided by <b>torsion</b> <b>balances.</b> The experiment is limited because of the non uniformity of the gravitational field of the Earth and the error in the measurement of semimajor axis, precisely {{in the same way as}} they limit the measurement of the product GM of the Earth. A better use of the pericenter of LAGEOS II can be made if the data are analyzed searching for a new Yukawa-like interaction with a distance scale of one Earth radius. It is found that the pericenter of LAGEOS II is 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to a composition dependent new interaction with this particular scale than it is to a composition dependent effect expressed by the eta parameter only. Nevertheless, the result is still a factor 500 worse than EP tests with <b>torsion</b> <b>balances</b> in the gravitational field of the Earth (i. e. at comparable distance), though a detailed data analysis has yet to be performed. While EP tests with satellite laser ranging are not competitive, laser ranging to the Moon has been able to provide a test of the EP almost 1 order of magnitude better than <b>torsion</b> <b>balances.</b> We show that this is due to the much greater distance of the test masses (the Earth and the Moon) from the primary body (the Sun) and the correspondingly smaller gradients of its gravity field. We therefore consider a similar new experiment involving the orbit of LAGEOS: testing LAGEOS and the Earth for an EP violation in the gravitational field of the Sun. We show that this test may be of interest, though it is a factor 300 less sensitive than in the case of the Moon due to the fact that LAGEOS is closer to the Earth than the Moon and consequently its orbit is less affected by the Sun. The limitations we have pointed out for laser ranging can be overcome by flying in low Earth orbit a spacecraft carrying concentric test masses of different composition with the capability, already demonstrated in ground laboratories, to accurately sense in situ any differential effects between them...|$|R

We also show that rotation at frequency much higher than the natural one is possible if the oscillator has 2 degrees of freedom, and describe how this property applies also to <b>torsion</b> <b>balances.</b> In addition, in the 2 D oscillator the signal is up-converted above resonance without being attenuated as in the 1 D case, thus relaxing requirements on the read out.
