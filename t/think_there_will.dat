25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be plenty of time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E
500|$|Dibnah {{was praised}} by many notable British people. [...] After {{reporting}} on his death, television presenter Peter Sissons remarked: [...] "They don't make them like that any more". Comedian Peter Kay said: [...] "It's very sad news. He {{was one of}} a kind and now he has gone I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no one else like him. He was enthusiastic about {{a way of life that}} has virtually disappeared now."

500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and people like him are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Pharrell Williams {{stated that}} [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was one of}} his {{favorite}} songs. [...] "It is hard to say if there is a greater song than [...] "Billie Jean". I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> never be a song like this one again, with this bassline, with this kind of effect, this eternalness, this perfection." [...] The song has featured in the film Charlie's Angels and the 2002 video game [...] When re-released as part of the [...] campaign in 2006, [...] "Billie Jean" [...] charted at No. 11 in the UK. It remained in the top 200 for over 40 weeks and was the most successful reissue by some distance. To date, [...] "Billie Jean" [...] is still in heavy rotation; it is played on over 90% of the world's radios and receives more than 250,000 spins per week in clubs around the world.|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a finality to moments of Phase Three, {{as well as new}} beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, {{so what do we do}} now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Around this time, a {{group of}} Austral Africa Company prospectors, led by Alfred Haggard, {{approached}} Lobengula's south-western border, hoping to gain their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the king honoured one {{of the terms of}} the Rudd Concession by allowing Maguire to go {{at the head of a}} Matabele impi to turn Haggard away. While Robinson's letter to Knutsford made its way to England by sea, the Colonial Secretary learned of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to ask if there was any truth in what the London syndicate had told him about the agreed transfer of 1,000 Martini–Henrys: [...] "If rifles part of consideration, as reported, do you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be danger of complications arising from this?" [...] Robinson replied, again in writing; he enclosed a minute from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official explained how the concession had come about, and expressed the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with assegais, so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them lethally dangerous. He then argued that it would not be diplomatic to give Khama and other chiefs firearms while withholding them from Lobengula, and that a suitably armed Matabeleland might act as a deterrent against Boer interference.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can depend}} {{much on the}} {{friendship}} of Major Dunwoodie, but his sense of honor is so pure, that--that--notwithstanding his--his--feelings--his desire to serve us--he will conceive it to be his duty to apprehend my brother again. Besides, he <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no danger in so doing, as he relies greatly on your interference." ...|$|R

"I {{think there}} is an {{obligation}} for the chairman and members of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to ask Lord Fraser to see them and testify under oath – it's that serious. Fraser should have said this at the time and, if not then, he was under a moral obligation to do so before the trial at Zeist. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be all sorts of consequences," [...] Dalyell declared.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013 on web-based publication, Tone Deaf, Kevin {{described}} the songwriting process with his [...] "best mates" [...] as [...] "a real democratic process, it's {{like trying to}} pass legislation".

2500|$|The {{vice-chairman}} of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said {{he wanted}} all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, [...] "I am going to write to every fanzine in the country – including Liverpool F.C.'s – telling them to ban FHM. People are very upset by it. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a real boycott." [...] He added {{it would be like}} making jokes about the 2002 Bali bombings, in which eight fewer Australians were killed. The publication was finally discontinued in 2016, for unrelated reasons.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be a future for him in the professional game, but I think he needs to learn a lot, and I think he can do it."

2500|$|Luke Eger, {{a farmer}} from Lycoming County, was {{the driving force}} behind the {{formation}} of Eagle Grange No. 1. He had read about the success of similar farmer's co-operative groups in states like Ohio, Iowa, and Minnesota. Eger contacted Oliver Hudson Kelley who was working for farmer's rights in Washington, D.C. at the time. Kelley encouraged Eger to establish a Grange in Lycoming County. Eger received little support from his friends and neighbors when he first attempted to establish a co-operative. In fact his brother-in-law, Frank Porter, is quoted in saying that Eagle Grange No. 1 was finally established, [...] "just to keep peace in the family." [...] Luke Eger wrote to the National Grange in 1871, [...] "I have at last succeeded in organizing and raising a club here and <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be little trouble in establishing clubs in the county." ...|$|E

So I'll say good-night and good-by now, for I may not have the opportunity in the morning." ...|$|R
2500|$|Van Vliet's {{arrival in}} Salt Lake City was welcomed {{cautiously}} by the Mormon leadership. Van Vliet {{had been previously}} known by the Latter-day Saints in Iowa, and they trusted and respected him. However, he found the residents of Utah determined to defend themselves. He interviewed leaders and townspeople and [...] "...attended Sunday services, heard emotional speeches, and saw the Saints raise their hands in a unanimous resolution to guard against any 'invader.'" [...] Van Vliet {{found it impossible to}} persuade resentful Mormon leaders that the Army had peaceful intentions. He quickly recognized that supplies or accommodations for the Army would not be forthcoming. But Young told Van Vliet that the Mormons did not desire war, and [...] "if we can keep the peace for this winter I do <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be something turned up that may save the shedding of blood." [...] However, marking a change from earlier pronouncements, Young declared that under threat from an approaching army he would not allow the new governor and federal officers to enter Utah. Nevertheless, Van Vliet told Young that he believed that the Mormons [...] "have been lied about the worst of any people I ever saw." [...] He promised to stop the Utah Expedition on his own authority, and on September 14 he returned east through the Mormon fortifications then being built in Echo Canyon (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Noel {{admits that}} certain {{lines from the}} song are lifted from John Lennon: [...] "I got this tape in the United States that had {{apparently}} been burgled from the Dakota Hotel and someone had found these cassettes. Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?" [...] Gallagher also admits that he was under the influence of illegal substances when he wrote the song and to this day he claims he does not know what it means.|$|E
