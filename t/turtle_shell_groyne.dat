The paper has studied the effect of microstructure on the mechanical behavior of the <b>turtle</b> <b>shell.</b> Furthermore the porous Fe-Cr based alloy was manufactured by the method of powder metallurgy. The results showed that <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> was composed of the element of Ca, P, C, Cl and Na etc. The microstructure of <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> is a sandwich structure typical of flat bones with the compact layer, the spongy layer with many pores and the fibrous inner layer. The unique structure affected the mechanical behavior of <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> very seriously. The sandwich structure can absorb the energy during transferring load, and very little energy is transferred to the endocortical bony and the internal organs. In this sense the soft part of <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> was protected by the shell. The porous Fe-Cr based alloy was manufactured by powder metallurgy and the pores are irregular and the porosity of alloy Fe-Cr is 19. 4 %. The microhardness of Fe- 20 Cr is 77. 5 HV. ...|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Jackson (2002) that the <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> can function as pH buffer. To endure through anoxic conditions, such as winter periods trapped beneath ice or within anoxic mud {{at the bottom of}} ponds, turtles utilize two general physiological mechanisms. In the case of prolonged periods of anoxia, {{it has been shown that}} the <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> both releases carbonate buffers and uptakes lactic acid.|$|R

50|$|In 1978, {{a survey}} of the upper Patuxent River using a proton {{precession}} magnetometer located the fleet. Further study of the wrecks, including one vessel dubbed the <b>Turtle</b> <b>Shell</b> Wreck', followed in 1979. The <b>Turtle</b> <b>Shell</b> was lying in the main river channel near Wayson's Corner, and covered by five feet of mud, the ship was well preserved, although it appeared the bow was torn off in an explosion.|$|R
50|$|Plastromancy or the <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> oracle is {{probably}} the earliest recorded form of fortune telling. The diviner would apply heat {{to a piece of}} a <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> (sometimes with a hot poker), and interpret the resulting cracks. The cracks were sometimes annotated with inscriptions, the oldest Chinese writings that have been discovered. This oracle predated the earliest versions of the Zhou Yi (dated from about 1100 BC) by hundreds of years.|$|R
40|$|Many evo-devo {{studies of}} the <b>turtle's</b> <b>shell</b> draw {{hypotheses}} and support from historical sources. The groundbreaking works of Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Carus, Rathke, Owen, and others are being revived in modern research, and their centuries-old understanding of the <b>turtle's</b> <b>shell</b> reconsidered. In the works of these eminent biologists of the 19 th century, comparative anatomy and embryology of turtle morphology {{set the stage for}} future studies in developmental biology, histology, and paleontology. Given the impact that these works still make on modern research, it is important to develop a thorough appreciation of previous authors, regarding how they arrived at their conclusions (i. e., what counted as evidence?), whether there was debate amongst these authors about shell development (i. e., what counted as an adequate explanation?), and even why these men, some of the most powerful and influential thinkers and anatomists of their day, were concerned with turtles. By tracing and exposing the context and content of <b>turtle</b> <b>shell</b> studies in history, our aim is to inform modern debates about the evolution and development of the <b>turtle's</b> <b>shell...</b>|$|R

50|$|On a <b>turtle's</b> <b>shell,</b> the {{greatest}} water flow {{is over the}} front central portion.

The movement is around 1.4 mm or less per day and is probably achieved by advancing the shell forward with each increment of growth. Over several months, several scutes can be crossed by these means.|$|R

40|$|<b>Turtle</b> <b>shells</b> {{and their}} gelled {{products}} are familiar {{in some countries}} as foods, tonics and medicines. These shells may come from endangered and protected species, requiring {{the identification of the}} species present to enforce national and international legislation. We report on the design of five combinations of primer pairs for the identification of <b>turtle</b> <b>shells</b> and shell fragments used as ornaments, food products and medicines. The types of samples used are those encountered frequently and will typically contain highly degraded DNA. The success rate for species identification using the test described is dependent upon the choice of primer sets used and the length of the expected amplification product. Gelled products were simulated by the process of decoction for up to 12 h, after which all the turtle species could be identified from the liquid samples.
