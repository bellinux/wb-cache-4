50|$|Four {{to eight}} percent of snowboarding {{injuries}} take place while the person is waiting in ski-lift lines or entering and exiting ski lifts. Snowboarders push themselves forward with a free foot while in the ski-lift line, leaving the other foot (usually that of the lead leg) locked on the board at a 9-27 degree angle, placing a large <b>torque</b> <b>force</b> on this leg and predisposing the person to knee injury if a fall occurs. Snowboard binding rotating devices are designed to minimize the <b>torque</b> <b>force,</b> Quick Stance being the first developed in 1995.

30|$|Root resorption, {{a sequel}} of {{orthodontic}} treatment, {{has been linked}} to the amount of torque applied to a tooth [13]–[15]. Torqueing of a tooth displaces the root apex horizontally which has been shown to induce root resorption [16].

Subjecting a tooth to torque could have potential root resorbing side effects [13],[14]. In a study by Hohmann et al., it was observed that torque applied to a tooth causes root resorption and that such resorption could be predicted using finite element analysis. In their study they opted to use hydrostatic pressure and concluded that when hydrostatic pressure surpassed 0.0047  MPa, the value corresponding to capillary blood pressure, root resorption occurs. We therefore calculated the hydrostatic pressure defined as S 1 [*]+[*]S 2 [*]+[*]S 3 / 3, for the different vertical positions of the brackets to assess the probability of root resorption. The hydrostatic pressure values obtained from our study are much greater than those observed by Hohmann et al. when they subjected the tooth to 3 and 6 Nmm of torque. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that wire engagement in our study resulted in higher <b>torque</b> <b>forces,</b> the minimum of which was 9.59 Nmm with the bracket positioned 5  mm from the cusp tip. It has been claimed that <b>torquing</b> <b>force</b> of 5 – 20 Nmm is acceptable clinically [27], and based on the results of the present study, bonding the bracket just 1  mm more gingivally than the 5  mm point could result in <b>torquing</b> <b>forces</b> exceeding the mentioned amount. As demonstrated by Hohmann et al. and several other authors, significantly more root resorption occurs by increasing the torque exerted on the tooth [13]–[15].|$|R

50|$|When using {{a machine}} that {{involves}} this mechanism, {{it is very important}} to not force the machine into reaching its maximum stress capacity; otherwise, the machine will break. The durability of the machine is related to the size of the arm and the velocity of the disc, where the arm might not be flexible enough to handle a certain speed. Creating a graphical layout for a quick return mechanism involves all inversions and motions, which is useful in determining the dimensions for a functioning mechanism. A layout would specify the dimensions of the mechanism by highlighting each part and its interaction among the system. These interactions would include <b>torque,</b> <b>force,</b> velocity, and acceleration. By relating these concepts to their respective analyses (kinematics and dynamics), one can comprehend the effect each part has on another.|$|E
50|$|Pushing {{the clutch}} pedal {{disengages}} the engine from the powertrain like wheels, drive shafts and gearbox. Releasing the accelerator makes the engine slowing down to idle. Turning of the ignition takes further affects. Pulling the key causes locking the steering wheel. Some vehicles drop head- or stoplights when ignition is turned off. After {{the engine is}} stopped, applying the brake longer time or give a few pushes to the brake releases the reserve of the vacuum servo, causing a lost of the brake support. A belt driven power steering fails immediately. Real hybrid vehicles have electric driven support of power steering and brake. Bigger engines and engines with higher compression ratio can cause damage to components of the powertrain at a rough start over clutch from gliding vehicles kinetic power or trailing drag. Using a higher gear decreases the <b>torque</b> <b>force</b> on the powertrain. By turning off the ignition the engine control unit (ECU) needs to detect the engine shafts position. Some ECUs need several rotations of the camshaft to detect ignition an injection timing points. Starting the engine in coldstart takes temporary more fuel until operation temperature of the engine is detected by the ECU.|$|E
50|$|One {{focus of}} {{ergonomic}} principles is maintaining neutral postures, which are postures in which muscles {{are at their}} normal length and able to generate the most force, while reducing stress and possible injury to muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones- therefore, in the workplace or in everyday life, it is ideal for muscles and joints to maintain neutral positions. Additionally, to prevent hand, wrist, and finger injuries, understanding when to use pinch grips (best for fine motor control and precise movements with low force) and power grips (best for high-force movements done repeatedly) is important for employees and general tasks outside the workplace. The choice of tools should match that of the proper grip and be conducive to neutral postures, which is important for employers to consider when purchasing equipment. In order to reduce injuries to the low back and spine, it is recommended to reduce weight and frequency of lifting cycles as well as decreasing {{the distance between the}} body and the load to reduce the <b>torque</b> <b>force</b> on the back for workers and individuals doing repeated lifting to avoid fatigue failure of the spine. The shape of objects being lifted should also be considered, especially by employers, because objects which are easier to grip, lift, and access present less stress on the spine and back muscles than objects which are awkwardly shaped and difficult to access.|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} the {{reactions}} transferred to the spacecraft during a manipulator manoeuvre {{is an important issue}} {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption and extend the operating life of the Attitude Control System. In this paper the performance of a novel least-squares-based reaction control method recently introduced by some of the authors is analyzed in the case of multi-degrees-of-freedom 3 D space manipulators. The proposed method locally minimizes the base reactions transferred by the manipulator to the base spacecraft by exploiting its redundancy, and has some important advantages with respect to the previous ones presented in the literature: a simple mathematical formulation, the possibility to use simple least-squares real-time routines for the solution, and the possibility to take into account the joint limits and the joint velocity and acceleration limits of the manipulator. The methods can be profitably used for the minimization of the base reaction <b>torques,</b> <b>forces,</b> and weighted combinations of them. The main objectives of the study presented in this paper are the implementation in a software simulator and the validation of the aforementioned reaction control solution in the case of 3 D space robots, the study of the Zero Reaction Workspace of a modular 3 D space robot, and the analysis of its dependence on the robot initial configuration and on the number of degrees of freedom of the robot.
