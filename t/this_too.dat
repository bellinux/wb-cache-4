5|$|An early {{picture of}} the court shows a {{building}} known as Wake's Tower on Court Hill. It is included in Saxton's map of 1570 but was demolished before 1738.

5|$|Prine {{is behind}} the kidnapping, and forces the {{children}} and driver into an underground bunker.

They arrive in time to apprehend Prine as he attempted to snatch the child, and take him into custody.|$|E
5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} {{to add to}} the castle, building a new house over the old west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House, some 2km to the south-east, until <b>this</b> <b>too</b> burned down in 1940. Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{served the}} mines well for almost 30 years, but {{the dock and}} river were {{affected}} by silting. A new channel across the sands was created in 1797, but <b>this</b> <b>too</b> was affected by silting, and by 1809 navigation to Kymer's dock was becoming dangerous.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months he}} was making {{proposals}} for a scientific expedition to South Georgia, but the RGS would not support his plans.

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; <b>this,</b> <b>too,</b> was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; <b>this</b> <b>too</b> was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

5|$|By mid-February, Morten had {{recovered}} from his illness and resumed {{command of the}} battalion which, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was moved forward to the south of Cassino, taking over part of the sector of the U.S. 36th Infantry Division with the 6th Brigade in reserve. An initial attack on Cassino, which involved the 4th Indian Division, the 28th Maori Battalion and New Zealand engineers, was mounted on 15 February but failed due to a lack of air and armoured support. Two days later, the 5th Brigade attempted to capture the town's railway station but <b>this</b> <b>too</b> failed.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{had been}} in turmoil {{since the start of}} the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, <b>this</b> <b>too</b> had been defeated, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and <b>this</b> <b>too</b> affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E

5|$|In 1818 Hope-Weir's {{grandson}} James Hope-Vere (1785–1843) asked Thomas Brown {{to provide}} designs for an attic extension, although this was never carried out. Ten years later, William Burn was commissioned {{to design a}} new north wing, incorporating a dining room, with new kitchens below and bedrooms above. The front of this extension was topped by a pediment matching Bruce's original, complete with pineapples, although <b>this</b> <b>too</b> was removed in the 1950s. The rear is bowed, with a curved stair led down to the garden at the rear. Plans for a matching wing to the south were never carried out. Burn also remodelled the interior, creating a large drawing room from the rooms of the south apartment.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but <b>this</b> <b>too</b> was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. <b>This,</b> <b>too,</b> can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
