25|$|On 13 February, Swedish {{government}} {{finally decided}} to send troops to Åland. Two days later, a naval detachment of the icebreaker Isbrytaren I, the coastal defense ship HSwMS Thor and the troopship SS Runeberg docked Eckerö in the Swedish side of the islands. A small military unit landed Åland in order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> from alleged misconduct of the Russian troops {{as well as from}} the violent threat of the Finnish sides of the Civil War. The Whites incorrectly assumed the Swedes had come to join them. Encouraged by this, the Whites took the artillery batteries in Boxö and Saggö, but instead of supporting them, the Swedes started negotiations with the Russians.|$|E
25|$|After Freetown, Sierra Leone, {{was founded}} in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor blacks from London and black Loyalists from Nova Scotia, resettled after the American Revolutionary War, they did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone. They tried <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States {{prohibited}} the African slave trade. After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to intercept slave ships off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at Liberia, a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society. As {{it was a place}} for freed slaves and free blacks from the United States, some free blacks emigrated there voluntarily, for the chance to create their own society.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March 2011, {{ten days}} after the {{hydrogen}} explosions, {{the recommendations of the}} Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> living near the exploded Fukushima reactors were put aside by the Japanese government. The proposed measures were based on the results provided by a computer program named SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information). This program was specially designed to predict the spread of radioactive materials after a nuclear accident. The proposed measurements included evacuations and administering iodine tablets to people to minimize their intake of radioactive iodine. However, the office of the Prime Minister decided that {{ten days after}} the explosions it was too late, and did not act on the proposals. These facts came to light in the first weeks of December 2011, when a government panel examined the details about the delay in utilizing the data produced by SPEEDI.|$|E

Ultimately, he has become burdened by guilt because of his actions in causing the world to fall into its current state. Noel's belief in the prophecy is reinforced when Lightning appears as the savior. They briefly ally to rout an extremist sect of the Children of Etro, who have been killing women who resemble Lightning. They later fight at Noel's hideout. Lightning provokes Noel into fully expressing his rage and engaging him in battle. After the battle, Noel destroys the oracle drive playing the fabricated prophecy, finally freeing himself from his guilt. After Bhunivelze's defeat, Noel offers his life to give Yeul {{a chance to live}} in the new world, and Caius allows the final incarnation of Yeul to go with him.|$|E

500|$|Mob violence, {{much of it}} {{perpetrated by}} vigilantes calling {{themselves}} [...] "Regulators" [...] who felt that local authorities had failed in their duties <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> was an ongoing problem during Stevenson's administration. In September 1867, Stevenson urged all Kentuckians to defer to local authorities and ordered that all vigilante groups be disbanded. On October 1, however, a group calling themselves [...] "Rowzee's band" [...] began perpetrating anti-Regulator violence in Marion County. He dispatched Adjutant General Wolford to Marion County, authorizing him to use the state militia to quell the violence if necessary. Wolford called out three companies of militia who suppressed [...] "Rowzee's band" [...] and sent another to put down a similar movement in Boyle County. Later in October, Stevenson dispatched the state militia to Mercer County, and militiamen were dispatched to Boyle, Garrard, and Lincoln counties in 1869.

500|$|On 31 May 1985, {{acting on}} a tip {{received}} by the West German prosecutor's office, police raided the house of Hans Sedlmeier, a lifelong friend of Mengele and sales manager of the family firm in Günzburg. They found a coded address book and copies of letters to and from Mengele. Among the papers was a letter from Bossert notifying Sedlmeier of Mengele's death. German authorities notified the police in São Paulo, who contacted the Bosserts. Under interrogation, they revealed {{the location of the}} grave. The remains were exhumed on 6 June 1985, and extensive forensic examination confirmed {{with a high degree of}} probability that the body was Mengele's. Rolf Mengele issued a statement on 10 June admitting that the body was his father's.

500|$|Upon {{his return}} from Afghanistan, Dutton wrote an article for The Guardian newspaper, in which he opined that the NATO-led forces in the country were making a {{difference}} and the situation was improving, but that the Afghan government still required assistance. He argued that more troops did not necessarily mean more violence, saying that [...] "experience shows that after an initial spike as the insurgents are cleared out, violence reduces to much lower levels" [...] and that [...] "providing {{a sense of security}} depends on much more than physical troop presence, but it has to start with that. We need sufficient troops <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and convince them that Afghan government control (supported by [...] for the moment) is sufficient to prevent the return of the insurgents. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "the backbone of the NATO alliance gives the coalition a steadfastness which [...] "coalitions of the willing" [...] cannot match. It also gives unparalleled authority and legitimacy based on the consensus of its members". Dutton concluded that [...] "given the strength of this unparalleled military coalition, and the political and financial commitment to building the long-term stability of Afghanistan and the region, failure should not be contemplated". He was awarded the American Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer), and given permission to wear the decoration, [...] "in recognition of meritorious, gallant and distinguished services during coalition operations in Afghanistan".|$|E

500|$|The British {{government}} submitted {{that the}} killings were [...] "absolutely necessary", within {{the meaning of}} Article 2, paragraph 2, <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Gibraltar from unlawful violence, because the soldiers who carried out the shootings genuinely believed that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were capable of detonating a car bomb, and of doing so by remote control. The families contested the government's claim, alleging that the government had conspired to kill the three; that the planning and control of the operation was flawed; that the inquest was not adequately equipped to investigate the killings; and that the applicable laws of Gibraltar were not compliant with Article 2 of the ECHR. The court found that the soldiers' [...] "reflex action" [...] in resorting to lethal force was excessive, but that the soldiers' actions did not—in their own right—give rise to a violation of Article 2. The court held that the soldiers' use of force based on an honestly held belief (that the suspects were armed or in possession of a remote detonator) could be justified, even if that belief was later found to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would, in the court's opinion, place too great a burden on law-enforcement personnel. It also dismissed all other allegations, except that regarding the planning and control of the operation. In that respect, the court found that the authorities' failure to arrest the suspects as they crossed the border or earlier, combined with the information that was passed to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. Thus, the court decided there had been a violation of Article 2 in the control of the operation.|$|E

2500|$|Deck {{specifically}} {{claimed that}} his rights to due process, prescribed by the 5th and 14th Amendments, were violated. Deck’s counsel {{made it clear}} that there was no reason such as a court disturbance to permit such shackling. In Deck’s argument to the Supreme Court, it was also argued that Deck’s 6th Amendment rights had been violated {{on the grounds of the}} Confrontation Clause. Deck’s shackling told the jury that Deck was a dangerous person and was shackled <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in the courtroom. Therefore, the jury had a picture in their mind that Deck was an awful person. Deck’s attorneys referred to this idea as prejudice towards Deck. Deck’s counsel argued that this meant that the jury was influenced by arbitrary details in deciding Deck’s sentence, not just the presented facts. [...] It was made clear that Deck could not cross-examine or defend against the idea of bias and prejudice against him. As a result his right to confront witnesses as stated in the 6th Amendment (as well as idea of an impartial jury) was violated by the shackles. Also, Deck’s counsel argued that the shackles violated the defendant's rights that “give meaning to the defendant’s right to be present at his trial.” [...] It was argued that the shackles limited Deck from freely conversing with his counsel, and that they prevented him from taking the stand to defend himself. The defense wrote that this would increase the chances of Deck being sentenced to death by the jury which made the shackling unconstitutional.|$|E
