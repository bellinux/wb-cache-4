5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and <b>then</b> <b>try</b> for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Muntz {{decided to}} sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract {{customers}} to his showroom, where he would <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was not a}} {{priority}} at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and <b>then</b> <b>try</b> for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

5|$|Thalaba travels {{down into}} the cave and meets the warrior Othatha chained to rocks. Thalaba frees Othatha before {{travelling}} further until he meets an Efreet that guards a gate to the Domdaniel. After shooting an arrow into an eye of the Efreet, {{he is able to}} proceed forward where he meets Khawla and Mohareb. He is able to knock them away from him and quickly moves forward to find the powerful sword of his father. The sword of flames covers Thalaba in flames which causes the area to be filled with light. This scares the sorcerers who <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to attack him. After Thalaba defeats Mohareb and the sorcerers, the voice of Mohammad asks Thalaba what he wishes. Thalaba simply gives his will up to the Prophet before destroying an evil idol, which destroys the cave.|$|E
5|$|To remedy this, {{assorted}} {{odds and}} ends were used to reinforce 18th Army. The first of these was the only German cavalry division, aptly named 1st Kavalleriedivision. The mounted troops of this unit, accompanied by some infantry, were to occupy the weakly defended provinces east of the river IJssel and <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to cross the Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dike). A simultaneous landing in Holland near Enkhuizen was to be attempted, using barges to be captured in the small port of Stavoren. As both efforts were unlikely to succeed, the mass of regular divisions was reinforced by the SS-Verfügungsdivision (including SS-Standarten Der Führer, Deutschland and Germania) and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, which would serve as assault infantry to breach the Dutch fortified positions. Still this added only 1 division to the equation.|$|E

25|$|Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{explained}} that the elections were called early {{in order to allow}} the parliament to work on important upcoming topics without being distracted by a future election.

25|$|Mature {{red deer}} (C. elaphus) usually stay in single-sex groups {{for most of}} the year. During the mating season, called the rut, mature stags compete for the attentions of the hinds and will <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to defend the hinds they attract. Rival stags {{challenge}} opponents by belling and walking in parallel. This allows combatants to assess each other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither stag backs down, a clash of antlers can occur, and stags sometimes sustain serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|Wolverines inhabiting the Old World (specifically, Fennoscandia) hunt more {{actively}} than their North American relatives. This {{may be because}} competing predator populations in Eurasia are not as dense, making it more practical for the wolverine to hunt for itself than to wait for another animal to make a kill and <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to snatch it. They often feed on carrion left by wolves, so changes in wolf populations may affect the population of wolverines. They are also known on occasion to eat plant material.|$|E
25|$|In June 1927, with Cousin Rex's encouragement, Wingate {{obtained}} six months' {{leave in}} order to mount an expedition in the Sudan.

Sending his luggage ahead of him, Wingate set off in September 1927 by bicycle, travelling first through France and Germany before making his way to Genoa via Czechoslovakia, Austria and Yugoslavia. From Genoa he took a boat to Egypt. From Cairo he travelled to Khartoum.|$|E

25|$|A {{majority}} of the General Assembly may pass articles of impeachment against a Justice, which the Senate will <b>then</b> <b>try.</b> Only a two-thirds majority will convict, and the Senate may punish a convicted Justice with only removal from office and prohibition on holding future office. After a Justice has been impeached by the General Assembly—but before the Senate renders a verdict on the charges—the Justice may not exercise any official function. By virtue of accepting {{a position in the}} Executive or Legislative branches of government or becoming a candidate for political office, a Justice is considered as resigned from the bench.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015 the City of Duluth {{had agreed}} to put up US$6M and had asked the state {{contribute}} the remaining US$4M to build a US$10M factory on the Duluth Airport dedicated {{to the production of}} SF50 Vision jets. The city would <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to recoup its costs for the facility from lease payments by Cirrus over time. The city is concerned that without the government support Cirrus will locate jet production elsewhere due to better incentives. This was confirmed by Cirrus CEO Dale Klapmeier and Duluth Mayor Don Ness, who both indicated that time is running out for the state to commit funds.|$|E
500|$|The first {{scientists}} {{to discuss the}} concept that names had a determining effect were early 20th-century German psychologists. Wilhelm Stekel spoke of the [...] "obligation of the name" [...] {{in the context of}} compulsive behaviour and choice of occupation; Karl Abraham wrote that the determining power of names might be partially caused by inheriting a trait from an ancestor who was given a fitting name. He made the further inference that families with fitting names might <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to live up to their names in some way. In 1952 Carl Jung referred to Stekel's work in his theory of synchronicity (events without causal relationship that yet seem to be meaningfully related): ...|$|E

500|$|On 25 June 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North Korean People's Army launched an attack into the Republic of Korea in the south. The North Koreans overwhelmed the South Korean Army and advanced south, preparing to conquer the entire nation. The UN ordered an intervention to prevent the conquest of South Korea. U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground forces into South Korea. The 24th Infantry Division was closest to Korea, {{and it was the}} first US division to respond. The 24th Division's first mission was to [...] "take the initial shock" [...] of the North Korean assault, <b>then</b> <b>try</b> to slow its advance until more US divisions could arrive.|$|E

Ann reluctantly agrees to the plan, but as the date progresses, she finds she actually enjoys herself and develops feelings for Chris. When Leslie accidentally gives away her secret plan, Chris is hurt and disparaged by Ann's ulterior motive. The next day, however, Ann apologizes and asks to continue dating Chris, who happily accepts.|$|E
500|$|Gerard Doyle {{provided}} the {{voice for the}} English audio book of Brisingr.

It was tricky even for Paolini {{to do this because}} he cannot [...] "roll [...] r's" [...] properly. Doyle said he prepared for narrating Brisingr by going [...] "largely by physical description.

But if a creature’s anatomical features are described, I try to imagine, for example, how the jaw might work...and <b>then</b> <b>try</b> and adapt that and attach it to something that sounds okay to the ear and is still slightly stranger than normal." ...|$|E
