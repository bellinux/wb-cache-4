50|$|Like {{other local}} anesthetics {{belonging}} in the amide group <b>trimecaine</b> decreases the cell membrane permeability, causes depolarization and shortens the action potential. Anesthetic effect starts in 15 minutes and remains 60-90 minutes. Its biological half-life is ca. 90 minutes. 10% of <b>trimecaine</b> is excreted unchanged (90% as its metabolites). It {{passes through the}} hematoencephalic and placental barriers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimecaine</b> {{must not}} be used at {{hypersensitivity}} on amide anesthetics, hypervolemia, hypotension, cardial conduction defects, asystole, cardiogenic shock and malignant hyperthermia in anamnesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimecaine</b> is {{probably}} a Czech discovery (in light of complex pharmacological and clinical evaluation and practical deployment) although its preparation was published by Löfgren in 1946.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimecaine</b> (systematic name (2,4,6-trimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl)diethylammonium chloride, {{chemical}} formula C15H25ClN2O) is an organic compound {{used as a}} local anesthetic and cardial antiarrhythmic. It is white crystalline powder readily soluble in water and ethanol. It is an active ingredient in products available under trademarks Mesdicain, Mesocain, Mesokain and others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trimecaine</b> has {{two main}} {{application}} fields. The {{first one is}} local anesthesia (topical, infiltrational, topical mucosal and inhalational, spinal and Bier's intravenous). It is used in concentrations 0.4 up to 4%, in some cases (e.g. in stomatology) in mixtures with adrenaline. The other field is prophylaxis and therapy of ventriculous arrhytmia on myocardial infarction and in cardiosurgery. It is used also for prophylaxis of sympathic reaction during tracheal intubations.|$|E
40|$|Promoting {{effect of}} cyclic monoterpenes on {{percutaneous}} absorption of antiarrhytmic drugs disopyramide, lidocaine and <b>trimecaine</b> {{was investigated in}} the rats. Laurocapram (Azone) {{was used as a}} standard comparator of penetration enhancement. The absorption of <b>trimecaine</b> was significantly enhanced by addition of limonene, trans-p-menthane and Azone in 1 % concentration. Lidocaine and disopyramide penetrated across the skin only when 1 % of limonene was used. Other cyclic monoterpenes showed no effect on percutaneous absorption of examined drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{proportion}} of fucosylated glycoconjugate-containing rabbit tracheal goblet cells after intratracheal application of <b>trimecaine</b> was studied to evaluate its possible unfavourable effects. This lapine model is comparable with diagnostic findings in humans because airway epithelia in humans and rabbits are similar; tracheal epithelium is also practically identical to bronchial epithelium in both species. Local <b>trimecaine</b> anaesthesia caused a proportional decrease in {{percentage of the}} tracheal goblet cells containing both α(1 – 2) - and α(1 – 6) -, α(1 – 3) - and α(1 – 4) -fucosylated glycoconjugates as revealed 10 min postexposure using lectin histochemistry. In previous studies, only mild ultrastructural damage to the airway's epithelium was revealed, but a conspicuous decrease in sialylated glycoconjugate-containing tracheal goblet cells and the dominance of acidic sulphated glycoconjugates were observed as after-effects of the same treatment. Glycoconjugate changes can influence the inner environment of airways (e. g. viscoelastic properties of the airways’ mucus and mucosal barrier functions) and thus the patient's defence barriers in airways may be weakened. Concurrently, the histochemical properties of goblet cells can be altered in bronchoscopic specimens. Since <b>trimecaine</b> is widely used as local anaesthesia in airways in bronchoscopy, {{it is necessary to}} heed these aforementioned effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the apressine, novocainamide, sulfamethoxypyridazine, ethonium, <b>trimecaine</b> hydrochloride and pyromecaine. The {{aim of the}} work is to search the theoretical and experimental approach to the chromatographic analysis of the amino-containing medicinal agents. The chromatographic methods for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the amino-containing medicinal agents, complex methods for purification from the protein and also the model for adhesion of the thermic damage have been developed.

40|$|The work purpose. To develop {{composition}} and technology of children's dental films with anesthetic and anti-inflammatory activity. Materials and methods. Pharmaceutical substance of <b>trimecaine,</b> Chamomile flowers and excipients: sodium carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin, polyethylene oxide- 600, purified water {{were used in}} the study. These were permitted for medical use and meet the requirements of the relevant regulatory documents. Aqueous extract from Chamomile flowers was obtained in laboratory conditions with method of remaceration in compliance with rules of technology for this method. The content of flavonoids in terms of rutin in flowers of Chamomile and the resulting aqueous extracts was determined with spectrophotometria by Pharmacopoeias method. Film-forming solutions were prepared in accordance with their physico-chemical properties and recommended technological modes of preparation. The dental films were obtained by the method of watering the film mass on a glass substrate, followed by drying. In order to select the optimal composition of dental films we investigated their adhesive properties, osmotic activity and biopharmaceutical performance. The adhesion activity of dental films was studied by the method, based on the determination of the strength of separation the glass plates from each other. The osmotic activity of dental films was determined by method of dialysis through a semipermeable membrane. The biopharmaceutical properties were evaluated by the method of diffusion in agar. Results. It was found that the most appropriate way to obtain an aqueous extract of Chamomile flowers is a three-stage remaceration of hot purified water, which allows to extract more than 70...|$|E
