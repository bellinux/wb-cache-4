5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> <b>of</b> Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Hugh Logan, a single father who leaves his little girl, May, at home when he goes on a business trip. On {{the way to the}} city he is attacked by robbers and left in the road. He is found and taken in, but he suffers from amnesia. He falls in love with Maud Neals and proposes to her. Due to the prolonged absence of her father, May is taken to an orphan asylum, but she escapes. May goes to the city and ends up stopping to sleep on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> <b>of</b> the Neals' home. Maud finds her and takes her in, where Logan recognizes his daughter and his memory comes back. Little is known of the production credits, but the film does feature Marie Eline as the little girl. It was released on August 5, 1910 and was met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

The police concentrate their effort {{on the theory that}} her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), a polished official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may have been her, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E

The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E

25|$|Indo-Corinthian capitals {{display a}} design and foliage {{structure}} which {{is derived from}} the academic Corinthian capital developed in Greece.

25|$|It was {{detailed}} {{in the contemporary}} civic codes, and had specific rules by which it could be used. The fast was often carried out on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> <b>of</b> {{the home of the}} offender. Scholars speculate this was due to the high importance the culture placed on hospitality. Allowing a person to die at one's doorstep, for a wrong of which one was accused, was considered a great dishonor. Others say that the practice was to fast for one whole night, as {{there is no evidence of}} people fasting to death in pre-Christian Ireland. The fasts were primarily undertaken to recover debts or get justice for a perceived wrong. There are legends of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, using the hunger strike as well.|$|E

25|$|Ai-Khanoum (Aï Khānum, also Ay Khanum, lit. “Lady Moon” in Uzbek), {{possibly}} the historical Alexandria on the Oxus, also possibly later named اروکرتیه or Eucratidia) {{was one of}} the primary cities of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Previous scholars have argued that Ai Khanoum was founded in the late 4th century BC, following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Recent analysis now strongly suggests that the city was founded c. 280 BC by the Seleucid king Antiochus I. The city is located in Takhar Province, northern Afghanistan, at the confluence of the Oxus river (today's Amu Darya) and the Kokcha river, and at <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> <b>of</b> the Indian subcontinent. Ai-Khanoum {{was one of the}} focal points of Hellenism in the East for nearly two centuries, until its annihilation by nomadic invaders around 145BC about the time of the death of Eucratides.|$|E
25|$|Europe's {{cultural}} makeover {{marked a}} period of significant innovation for adoption. Without support from the nobility, the practice gradually shifted toward abandoned children. Abandonment levels rose {{with the fall of}} the empire and many of the foundlings were left on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> <b>of</b> the Church. Initially, the clergy reacted by drafting rules to govern the exposing, selling, and rearing of abandoned children. The Church's innovation, however, was the practice of oblation, whereby children were dedicated to lay life within monastic institutions and reared within a monastery. This created the first system in European history in which abandoned children did not have legal, social, or moral disadvantages. As a result, many of Europe's abandoned and orphaned children became alumni of the Church, which in turn took the role of adopter. Oblation marks the beginning of a shift toward institutionalization, eventually bringing about the establishment of the foundling hospital and orphanage.|$|E
25|$|In mid-July, with Sherman {{practically}} on <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> <b>of</b> Atlanta, Confederate President Jefferson Davis demonstrated his {{dissatisfaction with}} Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's efforts {{to stop him}} by relieving him of command and placing the troops under Gen. John Bell Hood instead. Living up to his aggressive and often reckless nature, Hood wasted little time in ordering {{an attack on the}} Union forces near Peachtree Creek. Late in the afternoon on July 20, the Confederates assaulted Union Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas' Army of the Cumberland, to which the XX Corps was assigned, catching them completely off guard. Occupying the right flank of Alpheus Williams' First Division, the 46th was in danger of being overlapped by the Confederates. The companies positioned on the right were ordered to refuse the regiment's line, or pull back to form a right angle to the companies on the left. Eventually, with reinforcements arriving to plug a gap between Williams and the next Union division to his right, the Confederates were beaten back. For the 46th, the Battle of Peachtree Creek was second only to Cedar Mountain in the losses they sustained: 26 officers and men killed or mortally wounded, 86 wounded, and 1 missing.|$|E
