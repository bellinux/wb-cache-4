5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia.

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when these populations are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August.

However, they are unlikely to be bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have continuous development.|$|E
