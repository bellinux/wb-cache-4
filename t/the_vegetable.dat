5|$|The 18th and 19th century {{brought the}} {{discovery}} {{and production of}} synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> dyes, but some contained high levels of arsenic, and were eventually banned.|$|E

She helped Scott write the play <b>The</b> <b>Vegetable,</b> but when it flopped the Fitzgeralds found themselves in debt. Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills, but became burned out and depressed. In April 1924, they left for Paris.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>vegetables,</b> {{tamarind}} pulp, sambar powder, turmeric, salt, and asafoetida are boiled {{together until}} <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> are half-cooked. Then the cooked lentils (most often the split pigeon pea) are added {{and allowed to}} cook until <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> are done. A spice-scented oil {{is added to the}} cooked sambar for extra flavor and tempering, and the dish is served garnished with fresh coriander leaves or curry leaves.|$|R
50|$|From {{this point}} on, the dish is not stirred. When {{only a small}} amount of liquid is left in the bottom of <b>the</b> pot, <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> steam until tender. Once all the liquid has been absorbed and cooked off, <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> begin to fry in the oil or ghee left {{in the bottom of the}} pot. As <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> begin to char, a sizzling sound is heard, and the pot is removed from the heat.|$|R
5000|$|Stamppot {{can also}} be made in a single pot. Potatoes and <b>the</b> <b>vegetable(s)</b> or fruit of choice are placed in the pot. Water is added, and the mixture is left to boil. After <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> are cooked and drained, some milk, butter and salt are added, and <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> are mashed together. Sometimes the same pot is used to warm sausage as well, but those aren't mashed in. An example often cooked by this method is hutspot with carrots and onions as vegetables.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of <b>the</b> <b>vegetable,</b> recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|The food offerings {{made to the}} {{ancestors}} are usually cooked in silver or copper vessels and typically placed on a banana leaf or cups made of dried leaves. The food must include Kheer (a type of sweet rice and milk), lapsi (a sweet porridge made of wheat grains), rice, dal (lentils), <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> of spring bean (guar) and a yellow gourd (pumpkin).|$|E
5|$|The {{sweetness}} of carrots allows <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{to be used}} in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] {{original}} ratatouille recipe had <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> [...] fried before baking. Since {{at least}} 1976, some French chefs have prepared <b>the</b> ratatouille <b>vegetables</b> in thin slices {{instead of the}} [...] traditional rough-cut. Michel Guérard, in his book founding cuisine minceur (1976), recreated lighter versions of the traditional dishes of nouvelle cuisine. His recipe, Confit bayaldi, differed from ratatouille by not frying <b>the</b> <b>vegetables,</b> removing peppers and adding mushrooms.|$|R
50|$|In many {{traditional}} pickling processes, vegetables are submerged in brine, and salt-tolerant Lactobacillus species feed on natural sugars found in <b>the</b> <b>vegetables.</b> <b>The</b> resulting mix {{of salt and}} lactic acid is a hostile environment for other microbes, such as fungi, and <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> are thus preserved—remaining edible for long periods.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vegetable</b> Oil Industry Co. is a Nablus {{factory that}} {{produces}} refined vegetable oils, especially olive oil, and vegetable butter {{from the factory}} is exported to Jordan. The al-Huda Textiles factory is also located in Nablus. In 2000, the factory produced 500 pieces of clothing daily; however, production plummeted to 150–200 pieces daily in 2002. Al-Huda mainly imports textiles from China and exports finished products to Israel. There are eight restaurants {{in the city and}} four hotels — the largest being al-Qasr and al-Yasmeen. Nablus' once thriving soap industry has been largely isolated due to difficult transportation conditions stemming from West Bank closures and IDF incursions. Today, there are only two soap factories still operating in the city.|$|E
5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E
5000|$|Stamppot is {{prepared}} by boiling <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> and potatoes separately. Once done, the potatoes {{are added to}} the same pot as <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> and all are thoroughly mashed together. Rookworst, a type of smoked sausage, is the preferred piece of meat {{to be added to the}} dish in the Netherlands.|$|R

5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} first chance {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba {{on the right-hand side}} of Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and shot it past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. Sticks of celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back more than two decades and originated from song.|$|E
5|$|Where their ranges overlap, the two chough {{species may}} feed {{together}} in the summer, although there is only limited competition for food. An Italian study showed that <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs dug from the ground, whilst the Alpine chough took berries and hips. In June, red-billed choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas Alpine choughs ate crane fly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers, while the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. In the eastern Himalayas in November, Alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries, differing ecologically from the red-billed choughs in the same region {{and at the same}} time of year, which feed by digging in the soil of terraced pastures of villages.|$|E

25|$|Cotton mills get {{the cotton}} shipped {{to them in}} large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton {{comes out of a}} bale, it is all packed {{together}} and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an Opener. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a picker, and gets beaten with a beater bar in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.|$|E
