5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Cone {{production}} varies a {{great deal}} from year to year, but, {{as a result of its}} low flowering rate, is generally very low. However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the curculionid weevil Cechides amoenus.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, rays are harvested and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E

5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|On the Snake River {{in southeastern}} Washington {{there are several}} ancient sites.

The Marmes Rockshelter was flooded in 1968 by Lake Herbert G. West, the Lower Monumental Dam's reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E

50|$|Dominant and co-dominant canopy trees {{form the}} uneven canopy layer. Canopy trees are able <b>to</b> photosynthesize <b>relatively</b> rapidly due <b>to</b> {{abundant}} light, so it supports {{the majority of}} primary productivity in forests. The canopy layer provides protection from strong winds and storms, while also intercepting sunlight and precipitation, leading <b>to</b> a <b>relatively</b> sparsely vegetated understory layer.|$|R

Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E

5|$|Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide.

The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead <b>to</b> <b>relatively</b> mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
