5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
500|$|The idea Gough and Millar came up {{with for}} their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his [...] "... bare essence ...", {{discovering}} the reasons why Clark became Superman. In Smallville, Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> and by not making <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El {{at the end of}} season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die. Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.|$|E

On 4 September, the appeal court upheld the sentences on all of the Thirteen; who did not attend the session. Analysis said the decision was likely to fuel political tensions and street clashes, and highlight the low chances of any reconciliation in near future. Witnesses reported that protesters set tires on fire and clashed with security forces in several Shia villages following the verdict and one protester was severely injured by a stun grenade.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Massa thanked Whiting in the media; {{he said he felt}} Whiting [...] "did an excellent job of managing the situation, making <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions</b> as to when to start the race and when to bring in the Safety Car at the right moment". Schumacher, Petrov, Sutil and Buemi also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. Hamilton said he felt the length of time under safety-car conditions was not [...] "good for the spectators and it's not fun for the drivers". He additionally felt the track was dry enough for a normal restart. BBC commentator and former driver Martin Brundle said he felt the race should have started at an earlier time, while Button said he thought the event should have been stopped before visibility became poor. Nevertheless, the Grand Prix was awarded the Race Promoters Trophy at the FIA Gala Awards held in Monte Carlo in December 2010.|$|E
500|$|However, Disney {{found that}} the new Pinocchio was too {{helpless}} and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, {{in the summer of}} 1938 Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally the cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket Jiminy, and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions.</b> Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. Ward Kimball had spent several months animating a [...] "Soup Eating Sequence" [...] in Snow White, which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket. Kimball conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears. [...] "The only thing that makes him a cricket is because we call him one," [...] Kimball later joked.|$|E
500|$|Homer is [...] "a (happy) {{slave to}} his various appetites", and would gladly sell his {{soul to the}} devil in {{exchange}} for a single donut. He has an apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects, such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States, Incan mythology, bankruptcy law, and cell biology. Homer's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed, however, by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness, and stupidity. Homer has a low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene" [...] (which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid), his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma, and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain. In the episode [...] "HOMR" [...] (season 12, 2001) Homer gets surgery to remove the (newly discovered) crayon from his brain, boosting his IQ to 105, but although he bonds very well with Lisa, his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him less happy and he gets Moe to reinsert a crayon, causing his intelligence to return to its previous level. Homer often debates with his own mind, which is expressed in voiceover. His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice, sometimes helping him make <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> but often failing spectacularly. It has even become completely frustrated and, through sound effects, walked out on him. Homer's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season, but were later phased out after the producers [...] "used every possible permutation". These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on.|$|E

Former Offaly hurler Joachim Kelly, in the Irish Examiner, later agreed that video technology would be a good idea.

Clarke, Robert McCammon, and Stephen King. [...] A new batch of scripts was supplemented with remakes of classic Twilight Zone episodes like [...] "Dead Man’s Shoes", [...] "Shadow Play", and [...] "Night of the Meek". [...] Though the production crew was convinced that they were making all of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> ratings began to slide as the novelty of the show wore off.

2500|$|Valve's former {{business}} development chief Jason Holtman {{stated that the}} company sees themselves as an [...] "oddity" [...] {{in an industry that}} looks towards punctual delivery of products; instead, Valve [...] " [...] as hard as we can to make the best thing possible in the right time frame and get people content they want to consume. And if that takes longer, that's fine". For that, Valve takes the concept of [...] "Valve Time" [...] as a compliment, and that [...] "having customers consistently looking at our property or something you've done and saying, can you give me more" [...] is evidence that they are making <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions</b> with their game releases, according to Holtman. The company does try to avoid unintentional delays of their projects, and believes that the earlier occurrences of [...] "Valve Time" [...] delays, primarily from Half-Life development, has helped them improve their release schedules.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first months}} of 2008 was a {{particularly}} troublesome period which caused Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to [...] "work holidays and weekends" [...] and which did an [...] "extraordinary series of moves". It bolstered U.S. banks and allowed Wall Street firms to borrow [...] "directly from the Fed". These efforts were highly controversial at the time, but {{from the perspective of}} 2010, it appeared the Federal exertions had been <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions.</b> By 2010, Wall Street firms, in Clark's view, were [...] "getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth, prosperity and excess". A report by Michael Stoler in The New York Sun described a [...] "phoenix-like resurrection" [...] of the area, with residential, commercial, retail and hotels booming in the [...] "third largest business district in the country". At the same time, the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms, including the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements. The NYSE closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an electronic exchange. Beginning in September 2011, demonstrators disenchanted with the financial system protested in parks and plazas around Wall Street.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa's {{relationship}} with Clarke {{is presented as}} intense, complex, {{and the one thing}} that manages to soften Lexa's outlook on life. Debnam-Carey said the characters progression from being allies to becoming romantic [...] "stems from a connection that they both share—which is similar experiences and similar positions" [...] in that they are [...] "both very young leaders with great authority, a lot of responsibility. They have to lead a huge amount of people. They have a lot of expectations riding on them." [...] She said the sudden responsibilities they faced, the need to make <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> and the fact they both grieved over past lovers helped connect them further, and it is a connection they do not have with others. Rothenberg originally stated that while he would not go as far {{to say that it was}} love at first sight for Lexa, [...] "it definitely was a bit of a thunderbolt moment for her when she first saw Clarke." [...] He said Clarke's attraction to Lexa [...] "developed a little bit more slowly, but by the end [...] they were very much intrigued at the possibility of a romantic relationship." [...] He later said [...] "Lexa was definitely smitten—like love at first sight, probably", but maintained it took longer for Clarke to develop romantic feelings for Lexa.|$|E
