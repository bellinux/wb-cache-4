In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms."

[...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill.

Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices {{at the expense of the}} prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ.

40|$|Using a {{procedure}} that borrowed from both a quantitative and a qualitative research approach to psychotherapy, this study investigated audiotaped recordings of six sessions of Gestalt therapy conducted by five distinguished therapists. This in-depth, discovery-oriented research explored the interrelations between in-session client conditions, therapist operations and <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> In {{the first phase of}} the study, composite descriptions of six categories of <b>very</b> good <b>moments</b> were generated, based on the identification and the subsequent descriptions of 17 instances of <b>very</b> good <b>moments</b> made by a team of twelve judges. The six categories of <b>very</b> good <b>moments</b> were: From Neutral to Strong Feeling; Strong Expression Directly Toward Therapist; Extratherapy Behavior Change Intention; Acceptance of Problem-Self; State of General Well-Being; and New, Deeply Felt Personality Process-State. In the second phase of the investigation, judges identified explicit therapist operations and methods which, when carried out under identified client conditions or states, were judged as being instrumental in the subsequent occurrence of the given category of <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> The main finding was as follows: (a) The skilled and competent use of specific therapist operations, (b) with a client who is ready and willing to use the operations, and to move toward <b>that</b> <b>very</b> good <b>moment,</b> (c) appeared to result in the occurrence of <b>that</b> <b>very</b> good <b>moment.</b> For practitioners who value these categories of <b>very</b> good <b>moments,</b> the findings may be used as provisional suggestions for ways of facilitating the occurrence of these <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> For researchers, the findings are illustrative of continuing explorations into how psychotherapy works, into the relations between in-session client conditions or states, therapist operations, and consequent in-session <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> By means of careful, in-depth examination, researchers can learn what practitioners do to help bring about important and useful in-session client events...|$|R

2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not go. In <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.

2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael {{the son of}} Rabbi Jose if he {{had learned}} from his father the actual meaning of [...] "And on the seventh day God {{finished}} the work that He had been doing" [...] (for surely God finished God's work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God's work {{right at the end}} of the sixth day, so that in <b>that</b> <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly what time it is, must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair's breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed [...] Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God's work, and humanity's world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making [...] read, [...] "And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh."

Reading the words [...] "His work" [...] in [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet [...] says, [...] "He rested [...] [...] [...] from all His work." [...] He explained that [...] states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words [...] "Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make," [...] in [...] the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, he does that only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as [...] says, [...] "And He rested [...] [...] [...] and He blessed."
