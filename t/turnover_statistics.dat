40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{working in}} a {{challenging}} environment plagued by persistent personnel shortages, public sector midwives in Senegal {{play a key role}} in tackling maternal mortality. A better understanding of how they are experiencing their work and how it is affecting them is needed in order to better address their needs and incite them to remain in their posts. This study aims to explore their job satisfaction and its effects on their burnout, intention to quit and professional mobility. Methods A cohort of 226 midwives from 22 hospitals across Senegal participated in this longitudinal study. Their job satisfaction was measured from December 2007 to February 2008 using a multifaceted instrument developed in West Africa. Three expected effects were measured two years later: burnout, intention to quit and <b>turnover.</b> Descriptive <b>statistics</b> were reported for the midwives who stayed and left their posts during the study period. A series of multiple regressions investigated the correlations between the nine facets of job satisfaction and each effect variable, while controlling for individual and institutional characteristics. Results Despite nearly two thirds (58. 9 %) of midwives reporting the intention to quit within a year (mainly to pursue new professional training), only 9 % annual turnover was found in the study (41 / 226 over 2 [*]years). Departures were largely voluntary (92 %) and entirely domestic. Overall the midwives reported themselves moderately satisfied; least contented with their “remuneration” and “work environment” and most satisfied with the “morale” and “job security” facets of their work. On the three dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, very high levels of emotional exhaustion (80. 0 %) and depersonalization (57. 8 %) were reported, while levels of diminished personal accomplishment were low (12. 4 %). Burnout was identified in more than half of the sample (55 %). Experiencing emotional exhaustion was inversely associated with “remuneration” and “task” satisfaction, actively job searching was associated with being dissatisfied with job “security” and voluntary quitting was associated with dissatisfaction with “continuing education”. Conclusions This study found that although midwives seem to be experiencing burnout and unhappiness with their working conditions, they retain a strong sense of confidence and accomplishment in their work. It also suggests that strategies to retain them in their positions and in the profession should emphasize continuing education. </p...|$|R

However, only in the United States is a negative and statistically significant correlation between job turnover and employment growth actually observed. In the other countries studied, job turnover is either acyclical or mildly procyclical. Rather than being associated with the greater flexibility of the United States compared with the Western European labor markets, these asymmetries in the cyclical behavior of gross job flows can be attributed to statistical artifacts, namely, with the fact that U.

30|$|In {{an attempt}} to channel sales activities, {{companies}} often focus on ‘high value targets’ that offer attractive prospective returns. In liberalized electricity markets, commercial customers with high electricity demand constitute such high value targets. The problem when acquiring new customers, however, is that the electricity consumption is not known to the sales organization in advance. This hinders the possibility to prioritize sales targets and thus increases the acquisition cost, reduces the competitiveness within the market and ultimately leads to higher cost for electricity customers. In this study, we investigate the annual electricity consumption of enterprises {{by means of a}} dataset with 1810 company addresses in a typical town in Switzerland. We use the industry branch of the enterprises together with open big data (geographic information, online-content, social media data and governmental statistical data) to explain and predict the electricity consumption of such. Our linear regression analysis shows that information on the economic branches of the enterprises, basal area of buildings, number of opening hours and social media data can explain up to 19 % of variance in electricity consumption. Economic trends (e.g., in labor market and <b>turnover</b> <b>statistics)</b> reflect changes in the electricity consumption in the investigated years 2010 – 2014 for several economic branches.|$|E
40|$|Wyoming’s {{mining sector}} (including oil & gas) added {{the largest number}} of new jobs in third quarter 2011, and much of the growth in other sectors {{appeared}} related to oil & gas. Total unemployment insurance (UI) covered payroll increased by $ 181. 6 million (6. 3 %) in third quarter 2011. Employment rose by 3, 393 jobs (1. 2 %) and average weekly wage increased by $ 40 (5. 1 %). These increases are all higher than their five-year averages (see Table 1, page 3). In terms of dollars, UI covered payroll represents approximately 91 % of all wage and salary disbursements and 43 % of personal income in the state (U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2011). Analysts have noted that “minerals related employment {{is one of the key}} predictors of sales and use tax revenue ” in Wyoming (CREG 2010). The covered payroll and employment data in this article are tabulated by place of work, in contrast to the labor force estimates (see page 17) which are a measure of employed and unemployed persons by place of residence. Also, the employment data presented in this article represent a count of jobs, not persons. When individuals work more than one job, each is counted separately.

40|$|Are there {{beginning}} to be substantial numbers in Nairobi who are wholly and permanently dependent upon wage employment, and -whose ties with their villages of origin have become severed? This paper looks first at the statistical evidence, {{and then at the}} evidence provided by sociologists and social anthropologists who have done relevant 'field' research in different parts of Nairobi. The statistical evidence is at first sight ambiguous & Labour <b>turnover</b> <b>statistics</b> imply that people are staying much longer than a decade ago, when, short term circular migration was still the common pattern. The more favourable ratio of men to women also points in the same direction. But the sex ratio, {{especially in the case of}} the over 30 's is still greatly tilted towards male preponderances and the proportion of children - another index of 'stability' - is hardly higher than it was in 1962. It is only when one looks at the work of sociologists that the statistics begin to make sense, The work of Weisner, Ferraro and Parkin corroborates the statistical evidence of much longer residence in Nairobi, but shows that this in no sense implies any lessening of ties with rural homes. The high proportion of urban pay said to be remitted to families outside Nairobi is further evidence of these ties, as is the exceptional importance attached to having the longest possible holidays in order to be able to visit home. Those who arrive in Nairobi landless acquire land at the earliest opportunity, and only a small minority - mostly Kikuyu born in Nairobi - are totally enmeshed in the urban networks. These latter could perhaps be described as 'proletarians' -were it not for the awkward fact that most of them are petty capitalists in the 'informal' sector. The short answer, therefore, to the question posed in the title of this paper is 'no!; - but who is wanting a proletariat anyhow...|$|E

The purpose of the project was therefore to identify, measure, and monitor those factors which had the greatest impact on employee retention in an increasingly tight labor market for highly skilled and professional employees. Although there has been substantial progress in identifying individual variables that impact on turnover (e. g. Maertz & Campion, 1998), there has been no overarching framework to help mesh the motivations for staying with an organization. The purpose of this research was therefore to simultaneously investigate both turnover and retention factors. A parallel interest in the retention study was whether dissatisfaction with interpersonal relations in the workplace (namely, loneliness) resulted in the employee exiting the organization. Dissatisfied employees tend to withdraw from their organizations, either through psychological disconnection or actual job departure (Hanisch, 1995). Arguably, if an employee feels dissatisfied at work due to emotional or social detachment, it follows that they are likely to psychologically withdraw from that environment. This is particularly notable as both loneliness and organizational commitment appear to have an affective component as their underlying basis. Additionally, Lee, Mitchell and Wise (1996) found an association between interpersonal relationships at work and turnover intentions. It was therefore predicted that loneliness at work would {{have a negative effect on}} employee attitudes, instigating a desire to withdraw from the organization...|$|E
