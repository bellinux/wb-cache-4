5|$|George <b>Trice</b> {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced {{for the first time}} to the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by <b>Trice,</b> operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} as Tillingbourne Valley in 1924, {{and became a}} limited company in 1931, taking the name Tillingbourne Valley Services. It {{initially}} operated routes in the Guildford area from a garage in Chilworth using small single-deck buses painted in a maroon livery. Coach hire and excursions began in 1931, but two years later these activities split into a separate company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently for a further 24 years. Until 1970 Tillingbourne was owned and managed by three generations of the <b>Trice</b> family, before being sold to Trevor Brown.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Laffoon {{moved to}} San Antonio, Texas, where {{he opened a}} law {{practice}} and managed a citrus fruit business near Galveston. Though he had intended {{this to be a}} permanent relocation, while on a visit to family a few months later, friends urged him to return to Kentucky, and he obliged after only three months in Texas. In 1921, he sought election to the bench of the Fourth District Circuit Court. In the primary, he defeated <b>Trice</b> Bennett, a candidate from Princeton, and went on to face Republican incumbent Carl Henderson of Marion. In the general election on November 8, 1921, Laffoon defeated Henderson, carrying every county in the district. In his first term, only 7 percent of his decisions were reversed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was a record for the Fourth District at the time. He was re-elected for a second six-year term in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 AutoZone Liberty Bowl was a post-season American college {{football}} bowl game held on December 31, 2012 at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee in the United States. The 54th {{edition of the}} Liberty Bowl began at 2:30 p.m. CST and aired on ESPN. It featured the Iowa State Cyclones from the Big 12 Conference against the Conference USA champion Tulsa Golden Hurricane and was {{the final game of}} the 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams. The Golden Hurricane advanced to the game by virtue of winning the 2012 Conference USA Football Championship Game, while the Cyclones were also eligible for the bowl game due to their 6–6 regular-season record. The bowl was a rematch as the two teams had previously met on September 1 at the Cyclones' home of Jack <b>Trice</b> Stadium in Ames, Iowa; Iowa State won that game, 38–23.|$|E

25|$|D12 was the 1st to {{be signed}} {{as they had been}} rapping {{together}} since the 1990s, and the members had made a promise that whoever became successful would come back and sign the others. In June 2001, D12 released Devil's Night, peaking at #1 on the Billboard 200. Obie <b>Trice</b> was introduced to Eminem through D12 member Bizarre. Eminem signed him in June 2001 as the second Shady Records act. Obie <b>Trice</b> first got public attention via a freestyle skit on the Devil's Night album.|$|E

25|$|The City {{purchased}} {{land for}} the fourth City Hall in 1911-1912 from Eliza <b>Trice,</b> Otto H. Lang and the Sweeney Family. Designed by C. D. Hill in the Beaux-Arts style, plans were drawn up in 1913 and the Spring Fred A. Jones Building Company began construction. The building company filed for bankruptcy later that year, and the Board of Commissioners passed a resolution to accept the sale and transfer of materials to C. C. Street, Jr., who completed the building. The Municipal Building opened October 17, 1914.|$|E

25|$|In early 2006, Chicago-born Orange County, California-based rapper named Cashis joined Shady Records, {{after he}} managed to get his demo heard by Eminem. Later in 2006, Obie <b>Trice</b> {{released}} his second album, Second Round's on Me. However, the album did not fare as well commercially as his debut, seemingly because {{of the state of the}} hip-hop industry. The album saw a change in Obie Trice's style, whose first album was considered to be a little light-hearted. Second Round's on Me was considered to be a more serious, dark album, mainly showing the grittiness of Obie Trice's life and surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The SS Cavalry Brigade {{operates}} as follows: at dawn, without prior reconnaissance, the troop tasked with the inspection {{of a village}} rides into it at full speed {{and out the other}} end, occupies the outer edges of the village in a <b>trice,</b> in accordance with an agreed plan, and then gathers the whole population together, including women and children, for inspection. In many cases the skill and experience of the commanding officer, and also of the accompanying SD and GFP groups together with their interpreters, will decide upon the composition of the male inhabitants and their occupation, as well as upon their fate, so that the area is cleared of opposition and pacified.|$|E
25|$|In past years, {{the band}} {{participated in the}} Spirit Walk, wherein the band formed a tunnel into the stadium from the main {{thoroughfare}} and played various school songs as the football team entered. From here, the band moved approximately two hours before kickoff into {{the courtyard of the}} Iowa State Center near the Scheman Building. Here the students would stretch and warm up on their musical instrument. Guides would sometime give special performances before assembly for early-arriving Cyclone fans, and the whole band would perform a few songs and a sample of the halftime shows for the gathered audience. The band would then break by ranks to form a block and parade under cadences to the south side of Jack <b>Trice</b> Stadium for pregame.|$|E

He weighed about [...] at the age of fourteen. Unable to play football as a sophomore because of his grades, Davis refocused and brought his grades up. He played football as a junior, but could not play as a senior due to his class graduating the year prior.|$|E
500|$|Tillingbourne {{was formed}} in 1924 by Vic Smith and George <b>Trice.</b> It was {{initially}} known as Tillingbourne Valley, and operated a single vehicle in a maroon livery from a garage in Chilworth on a service between Guildford and Gomshall. Smith left the company in the late 1920s, and a new route from Guildford to Albury Park was introduced around the same time, with four vehicles owned by 1928. The route to Gomshall was extended to Peaslake, and briefly faced competition from Surrey Hills Motor Services prior to their takeover by Aldershot & District, who withdrew the competing route. The company's garage was rebuilt after being destroyed in a fire along with three of its vehicles in 1928. Tillingbourne was reconstituted as a limited company, Tillingbourne Valley Services Limited, in October 1931.|$|E
500|$|As per Priyadas' account, Tulsidas {{followed}} {{the instruction of}} Hanumana and started living in an Ashram at Ramghat in Chitrakuta. One day Tulsidas went to perform the Parikrama (circumambulation) of the Kamadgiri mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognise them and took his eyes off them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas if he saw Rama and his brother Lakshmana on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas {{that he would have}} the sight of Rama once again the next morning.
