5000|$|Studies in 2007 have catalogued {{nucleosome}} {{positions in}} yeast and shown that nucleosomes are depleted in promoter regions and origins of replication.About 80% of the yeast genome {{appears to be}} covered by nucleosomes [...] and the pattern of nucleosome positioning clearly relates to DNA regions that regulate transcription, regions that are transcribed and regions that initiate DNA replication. Most recently, a new study examined ‘’dynamic changes’’ in nucleosome repositioning during a global transcriptional reprogramming event to elucidate the effects on nucleosome displacement during genome-wide transcriptional changes in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The results suggested that nucleosomes that were localized to promoter regions are displaced in response to stress (like heat shock). In addition, the removal of nucleosomes usually corresponded to transcriptional activation and the replacement of nucleosomes usually corresponded to transcriptional repression, presumably because transcription factor binding sites became more or less accessible, respectively. In general, {{only one or two}} nucleosomes were repositioned at the promoter to effect these transcriptional changes. However, even in chromosomal regions that were not associated with transcriptional changes, nucleosome repositioning was observed, suggesting that the covering and uncovering of transcriptional DNA does not necessarily produce a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event.</b> After transcription, the rDNA region has to protected from any damage, it suggested HMGB proteins {{play a major role in}} protecting the nucleosome free region.|$|E

With only ten major proteins, the virus must gain nuclear access, replicate, assemble progeny virions in the cytoplasm, and then egress. In an effort to elucidate the coordination of these events, we manipulated the transcript levels from the bicistronic nonstructural segment that encodes the spliced virus product responsible for genomic nuclear export. We find that utilization of an erroneous splice site ensures the slow accumulation of the viral nuclear export protein (NEP) while generating excessive levels of an antagonist that inhibits the cellular response to infection. Modulation of this simple <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event</b> results in improperly timed export and loss of virus infection. Together, these data demonstrate that coordination of the influenza A virus life cycle is set by a “molecular timer” that operates on the inefficient splicing of a virus transcript...|$|E

40|$|The enzyme spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase (N 1 -SAT) {{is rapidly}} induced by heat shock in CHO and A 549 cells, with {{activity}} declining by 24 h. Depletion of intracellular polyamines by alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, blocks this induction. Re-addition of putrescine to these cultures restores {{the response to}} heat shock, with a concomitant increase in intracellular N 1 -acetylspermidine. Diaminopropane {{is more than twice}} as effective as the naturally occurring diamine putrescine, suggesting that the propylamine moiety of spermidine is involved in the regulation of N 1 -SAT induction. Inhibitor studies indicate transcriptional activation and that the enzyme has an apparent half-life of 30 - 60 min. A second heat shock rapidly inhibits induced N 1 -SAT activity, which decays with a half-life of 2 - 3 min. Despite its induction by heat, N 1 -SAT is not a stable enzyme, suggesting that the activity observed is not due to a modification of an existing peptide, but is due to a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event,</b> which may justify the inclusion of this enzyme in the family of heat-shock proteins...|$|E

Further analysis revealed that sequence elements are involved that many rp-genes have in common and that previously were identified as transcription activation sites (RPG-boxes or UASrpg).

In addition, both copy genes encoding rp 28 which differ considerably in their extent of transcriptional activity, show the upshift effect in a proportional manner.

40|$|The acute-phase {{activation}} of the rat angiotensinogen (rAT) gene in liver cells is a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event</b> mediated through an interleukin- 1 -inducible, NF kappa B-binding, cis-acting element (the acute-phase response element [APRE]). Using a cell culture model for the acute-phase response, we showed {{that the increase in}} angiotensionogen mRNA in H 35 rat hepatoma cells requires costimulation with glucocorticoids and cytokines. Stably transfected rAT promoter-luciferase reporter genes were also activated by cytokines only in the presence of glucocorticoids. This permissive role of glucocorticoids is dependent on the expression of functional glucocorticoid receptors, because in HepG 2 cells naturally deficient in such receptors, rAT gene-luciferase reporter constructs responded to interleukin- 1 only when cotransfected with an expression vector for the glucocorticoid receptor. Point mutations in the two rAT gene glucocorticoid response elements located adjacent to the APRE led to loss of interleukin- 1 inducibility. Induction of luciferase activity in transfected cells occurred even in the presence of cycloheximide, demonstrating that this synergistic response did not depend on new protein synthesis. Thus, a direct interaction between the interleukin- 1 -inducible NF kappa B-binding APRE and glucocorticoid response elements, located in cis, underlies the acute-phase {{activation of}} the rAT gene...|$|E

40|$|Early {{compacting}} mouse morulae {{were placed}} in a-amanitin at various times after HCG {{and the effect of}} this transcriptional inhibitor during formation of the blastocyst was noted. No cavitation was observed in those embryos transferred into a-amanitin before 77 h after HCG but the percentage of cavitation increased dramatically in those embryos transferred after 80 h post HCG. The large increase in amino acid incorporation which normally occurs during formation of the blastocyst was blocked in those embryos placed in the inhibitor before 80 h post HCG. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of radiolabelled embryos showed that the changes in synthesis of certain polypeptides normally associated with blastocyst formation did not occur in those embryos placed in a-amanitin before 80 h after HCG. Only one cleavage division appears to occur in the presence of a-amanitin. However, groups of embryos which had completed their fifth division before exposure to the drug subsequently were able to form blastocysts and showed the quantitative and qualitative changes associated with blastocyst formation despite the continued presence of the inhibitor.

We now report the effect of histamine on gene expression and total cellular synthesis of TNF-alpha. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced synthesis of TNF-alpha in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from 18 healthy donors was suppressed by histamine concentrations from 10 (- 6) to 10 (- 4) M, levels comparable with those measured in tissues after mast cell degranulation. Histamine (10 (- 5) M) markedly suppressed LPS-induced synthesis of TNF-alpha in both unfractionated PBMC (83 % inhibition, p less than 0. 001) and monocytes purified by positive selection of LeuM 3 + cells (62 % inhibition, p less than 0. 05). The suppressive effect of histamine on TNF-alpha synthesis did not require the presence of T cells. The histamine-mediated decrease in TNF-alpha synthesis was not affected by indomethacin, nor by diphenhydramine, an H 1 receptor antagonist, but was reversed by cimetidine or ranitidine, H 2 receptor antagonists, in a dose-dependent manner. Suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis by histamine {{is likely to be a}} <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event,</b> since histamine (10 (- 5) M) reduced TNF-alpha mRNA levels fourfold.

40|$|In {{dynamical}} systems theory, {{a system}} which can be described by differential equations is called a continuous dynamical system. In studies on genetic oscillation, most deterministic models at early stage are usually built on ordinary differential equations (ODE). Therefore, gene transcription which is a vital part in genetic oscillation is presupposed to be a continuous dynamical system by default. However, recent studies argued that discontinuous transcription might be more common than continuous transcription. In this paper, by appending the inserted silent interval lying between two neighboring transcriptional events {{to the end of}} the preceding event, we established that the running time for an intact <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event</b> increases and gene transcription thus shows slow dynamics. By globally replacing the original time increment for each state increment by a larger one, we introduced fractional differential equations (FDE) to describe such globally slow transcription. The impact of fractionization on genetic oscillation was then studied in two early stage models – the Goodwin oscillator and the Rössler oscillator. By constructing a ‘‘dual memory’ ’ oscillator – the fractional delay Goodwin oscillator, we suggested that four general requirements for generating genetic oscillation should be revised to be negative feedback, sufficient nonlinearity, sufficient memory and proper balancing of timescale. The numerical study of the fractional Rössler oscillator implied that the globally slow transcription tends to lower the chance of a coupled or more complex nonlinea...|$|E

Homologous up-regulation of calcitriol receptor (VDR) by calcitriol {{is believed to}} be a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event.</b> In this experiment, we studied the effect of calcitriol on VDR in normal and renal failure rats. The time course of the effect of calcitriol on VDR mRNA showed a biphasic change in VDR mRNA in response to calcitriol. The concentration of intestinal VDR mRNA increased at six hours and reached peak levels approximately 15 hours after calcitriol injection. Thereafter, the mRNA began to decrease and by 48 hours the level had declined to below the control values. The VDR levels also increased, though they lagged behind the VDR mRNA, and nearly plateaued at 24 hours after calcitriol treatment. In renal failure, the concentrations of VDR were lower and the levels of VDR mRNA were higher than the respective values of normal rats, suggesting that VDR synthesis was inhibited at post-transcriptional sites. Chronic administration of calcitriol increased the VDR but lowered the VDR mRNA levels in both normal and renal failure rats. Infusion of uremic ultrafiltrate to normal rats resulted in lower VDR and higher VDR mRNA levels similar to those found in rats with renal failure. The results indicate that uremic toxins are responsible for the low VDR and high VDR mRNA in renal failure...|$|E

The concentration of HMW adiponectin in female {{was significantly higher than}} that in male, whereas there were no gender differences for the other two forms. Castration induced a dramatic elevation of the HMW form but had no effect on either the middle molecular weight or the low molecular weight form in mice. Testosterone treatment, on the other hand, caused a specific reduction of HMW adiponectin in the circulation. Pulse-chase labeling experiments in rat adipocytes revealed that the three oligomeric forms of adiponectin were secreted into the culture medium at different rates and that testosterone selectively impeded the secretion of HMW adiponectin but not the other two forms. The inhibitory effect of testosterone on secretion of HMW adiponectin was largely restored by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, suggesting the involvement of a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>event</b> in this process. The selective inhibition of HMW adiponectin by testosterone might contribute to the sex dimorphism of adiponectin in terms of its oligomeric complex distribution and could partly explain why men have higher risk to insulin resistance and atherosclerosis than women. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
