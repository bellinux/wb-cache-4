We found that cultured neurons from a key forebrain structure, the dorsal thalamus, develop a need for survival factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from their major target, the cerebral cortex, at {{the age at which}} they innervate it. Experiments in vivo have shown that rates of dorsal <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> death are reduced by increasing cortical levels of BDNF and are increased in mutant mice lacking functional BDNF receptors or thalamocortical projections; these experiments have also shown that an increase in the rates of dorsal <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> death can be achieved by blocking BDNF in the cortex. We suggest that the onset of a requirement for cortex-derived neurotrophic factors initiates a competitive mechanism regulating programmed cell death among dorsal thalamic neurons.

Although much is known about the biochemistry of the intracellular pathways that lead to programmed cell death by apoptosis, the mechanisms that initiate the process and regulate its rate are less well defined.

40|$|We {{present a}} lumped {{computational}} {{model of the}} thalamo–cortico–thalamic circuitry. The model essentially consists of two modules: a thalamic module and a cortical module. The thalamic module circuitry is {{a modified version of}} a classic neural mass computational model of the thalamic circuitry to simulate cortical alpha rhythms and which we have used in previous research to study EEG abnormality associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Here, we introduce a modified synaptic structure representing a neuronal population in the thalamic model. Furthermore, the synaptic organisation and connectivity parameter values in the model are based on experimental data reported from the dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of different species. The cortical module circuitry is based on a recent work studying cortical brain rhythms. We vary the synaptic connectivity parameters in the thalamic module of the model to simulate the effects of AD on brain synaptic circuitry and study power within the alpha frequency bands. The power and dominant frequencies of the model output are studied in three sub-bands within the alpha band: lower alpha (7 – 9 Hz), middle alpha (9 – 11 Hz) and upper alpha (11 – 13 Hz). Such an analytical method conforms to recent comparative EEG studies on young adults, healthy aged adults and MCI or early stage AD patients. The results show a remarkable role of the synaptic connectivities in the inhibitory <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> populations on the alpha band power and frequency. Furthermore, the total number of active synapses in the <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> populations produces the slowing of alpha rhythms and a simultaneous decrease of alpha band power in the brain as a result of AD...|$|E
40|$|Object: This study {{investigates the}} outcome after {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) in mice lacking the essential DNA repair gene xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA). As damage to DNA has been implicated in neuronal cell death in various models, the authors sought to elucidate whether {{the absence of an}} essential DNA repair factor would affect the outcome of TBI in an experimental setting. Methods: Thirty-seven adult mice of either wild-type (n = 18) or XPA-deficient ("knock-out" [n = 19]) genotype were subjected to controlled cortical impact experimental brain trauma, which produced a focal brain injury. Sham-injured mice of both genotypes were used as controls (9 in each group). The mice were subjected to neurobehavoral tests evaluating learning/acquisition (Morris water maze) and motor dysfunction (Rotarod and composite neuroscore test), pre- and postinjury up to 4 weeks. The mice were killed after 1 or 4 weeks, and cortical lesion volume, as well as hippocampal and <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> loss, was evaluated. Hippocampal staining with doublecortin antibody was used to evaluate neurogenesis after the insult. Results: Brain-injured XPA(-/-) mice exhibited delayed recovery from impairment in neurological motor function, as well as pronounced cognitive dysfunction in a spatial learning task (Morris water maze), compared with injured XPA(+/+) mice (p < 0. 05). No differences in cortical lesion volume, hippocampal damage, or <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> loss were detected between XPA(+/+) and XPA(-/-) mice after brain injury. Also, no difference in the number of cells stained with doublecortin in the hippocampus was detected.

40|$|The {{thalamus}} {{is a key}} {{structure that}} controls the routing of information in the brain. Understanding modulation at the thalamic level is critical to understanding {{the flow of information}} to brain regions involved in cognitive functions, such as the neocortex, the hippocampus, and the basal ganglia. Modulators contribute the majority of synapses that <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells</b> receive, and the highest fraction of modulator synapses is found in thalamic nuclei interconnected with higher order cortical regions. In addition, disruption of modulators often translates into disabling disorders of executive behavior. However, modulation in thalamic nuclei such as the midline and intralaminar groups, which are interconnected with forebrain executive regions, has received little attention compared to sensory nuclei. Thalamic modulators are heterogeneous in regards to their origin, the neurotransmitter they use, and the effect on <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells.</b> Modulators also share some features, such as having small terminal boutons and activating metabotropic receptors on the cells they contact.

These data indicate the presence of a thalamocortical dysrhythmia, which we propose is responsible for all the above mentioned conditions. This coherent activity, the result of a resonant interaction between thalamus and cortex, is due to the generation of low-threshold calcium spike bursts by thalamic cells. The presence of these bursts is directly related to <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> hyperpolarization, brought about by either excess inhibition or disfacilitation. The emergence of positive clinical symptoms is viewed as resulting from ectopic -band activation, which we refer to as the "edge effect.

30|$|Using the {{multiscale}} modeling perspective, Lisman {{and colleagues}} considered that the psychotic break might reflect a bistable {{system with a}} state switch triggered by the stressful event [66]. They described this switch as being manifested in dynamic changes that would be influenced {{by a number of}} local measures, including imbalance of excitation mediated by glutamate receptors and inhibition mediated by GABA receptors (an inhibitory receptor type), abnormal gamma frequency (25 – 100  Hz) oscillations and hyperactive ventral tegmental area (VTA)—thalamic-hippocampal loop. One of their computer models included the CA 1 region of the hippocampus, the thalamus and the VTA. CA 1 was modeled as firing of principal cells which are stimulated by the bursting of thalamic neurons and inhibited by local inhibition. Bursting of <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells</b> was driven by membrane hyperpolarization, which in turn was calculated based on NMDAR (NMDA type of glutamatergic receptor) blockage and level of dopaminergic activity in the VTA. Dopaminergic activity within the VTA was dependent on input from CA 1 region as well as stress. In the model, baseline reduced NMDAR activation (the predisposition) resulted in hyperpolarization of the <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells,</b> paradoxically increasing their bursting (post-anodal exaltation). In the presence of stress, activity increased in VTA and thalamus, providing positive feedback with hyperactivity. The hyperactivity persisted after the stress had been removed—a jump to an alternative attractor in this bistable system [67]. The system can subsequently make further jumps back and forth. Exposed to the same stress, a person without the NMDAR blockage predisposition would not show the switch to the alternate attractor and would maintain normal dynamics.|$|R

While the telencephalon has been majorly researched upon, a lot remains unknown about diencephalic development, more precisely the origin and the genetic mechanisms that generate the diverse connectivity patterns that are seen in the neurons of the various sub-divisions of the diencephalon. The goal of this project was to study the genetic mechanisms that are involved in the development of mouse diencephalic neurons from their progenitor stage towards maturity. Pax 6 is a paired domain containing transcription factor expressed broadly in the progenitors and some of the post-mitotic cells of the diencephalon. I have identified Pax 6 as a key regulator for restricting the domain specific expression of proneural genes and also post-mitotic gene expression in both the habenula and thalamic subdivisions of the diencephalon. These functions of Pax 6 are mediated at least in part by SIM. Gbx 2 is a homeodomain containing transcription factor that is exclusively expressed in post-mitotic cells of the thalamus. In a separate study, I have found that loss of Gbx 2 function leads to ectopic expression of habenular and pretectal markers in the <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells.</b> Gbx 2 thereby functions in determining the identity of these cells. Lastly, I have also identified that along with LIM-HD transcription factors Lhx 2 and Lhx 9 as partners, Gbx 2 determines thalamic neuron connectivity by cell-autonomously regulating the dynamic expression pattern of axon guidance receptors Robol and Robo 2 in the <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells.</b> ...|$|R

Stereotactic medial thalamotomies were performed on 104 patients with chronic therapy-resistant positive symptoms. Peroperative recordings of 2012 single units revealed an overwhelming unresponsiveness (99 %) to sensory stimuli or motor activation. Among these unresponsive cells, 45. 1 % presented a rhythmic or random bursting activity. Rhythmic bursting activities had an average interburst interval of 263 ± 46 ms corresponding to a frequency of 3. 8 ± 0. 7 Hz. Frequency variations among the different symptoms were not statistically different. Intraburst characteristics such as the highest frequency encountered in the burst (480 ± 80 Hz) or the mean frequency of the burst (206 ± 44 Hz) were also similar in all patients. All bursts, rhythmic or random, fulfilled the extracellular criteria of low-threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts.

40|$|Ascending sensory {{information}} reaches primary sensory cortical areas via thalamic relay neurons that are organized into modality-specific compartments or nuclei. Although the sensory relay nuclei of the thalamus show consistent modality-specific segregation of afferents, we now {{show in a}} wild-type mouse strain that the visual pathway can be surgically "rewired" so as to induce permanent retinal innervation of auditory <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> groups. Applying the same rewiring paradigm to a transgenic mouse lacking the EphA receptor family ligands ephrin-A 2 and ephrin-A 5 results in more extensive rewiring than in the wild-type strain. We also show {{for the first time}} that ephrin-A 2 and ephrin-A 5 define a distinct border between visual and auditory thalamus. In the absence of this ephrin-A 2 /A 5 border and after rewiring surgery, retinal afferents are better able to invade and innervate the deafferented auditory thalamus. These data suggest that signals that induce retinal axons to innervate the denervated auditory thalamus may compete with barriers, such as the ephrins, that serve to contain them within the normal target. The present findings thus show that the targeting of retinothalamic projections can be surgically manipulated in the mouse and that such plasticity can be controlled by proteins known to regulate topographic mapping.

We studied the effect of cortical deactivation on the association of neural activity within the thalamus during spontaneous activity. The corticofugal influence was suppressed by temporary cooling of the auditory cortex. Pairs of spike trains recorded from the same electrode were distinguished from cases where units were in MGB but recorded with different electrodes. Time domain analyses included crosscorrelations and search for precise repetition of complex spatiotemporal firing patterns of reverberating thalamic circuits. As a complementary approach we performed bispectral analyses of simultaneously recorded local field potentials in order to uncover the frequency components of their power spectra which are non linearly coupled. All results suggest that new functional neuronal circuits might appear at the thalamic level {{in the absence of}} input from the cortex.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mammalian}} thalamus relays {{sensory information}} from the periphery to the cerebral cortex for cognitive processing via the thalamocortical tract. The thalamocortical tract forms during embryonic development controlled by mechanisms that are not fully understood. β-catenin is a nuclear and cytosolic protein that transduces signals from secreted signaling molecules to regulate both cell motility via the cytoskeleton and gene expression in the nucleus. In this study we tested whether β-catenin is likely {{to play a role}} in thalamocortical connectivity by examining its expression and activity in developing thalamic neurons and their axons. Results At embryonic day (E) 15. 5, the time when thalamocortical axonal projections are forming, we found that the thalamus is a site of particularly high β-catenin mRNA and protein expression. As well as being expressed at high levels in <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> bodies, β-catenin protein is enriched in the axons and growth cones of thalamic axons and its growth cone concentration is sensitive to Netrin- 1. Using mice carrying the β-catenin reporter BAT-gal we find high levels of reporter activity in the thalamus. Further, Netrin- 1 induces BAT-gal reporter expression and upregulates levels of endogenous transcripts encoding β-actin and L 1 proteins in cultured thalamic cells. We found that β-catenin mRNA is enriched in thalamic axons and its 3 'UTR is phylogenetically conserved and is able to direct heterologous mRNAs along the thalamic axon, where they can be translated. Conclusion We provide evidence that β-catenin protein is likely to be an important player in thalamocortcial development. It is abundant both in the nucleus and in the growth cones of post-mitotic thalamic cells during the development of thalamocortical connectivity and β-catenin mRNA is targeted to thalamic axons and growth cones where it could potentially be translated. β-catenin is involved in transducing the Netrin- 1 signal to thalamic cells suggesting a mechanism by which Netrin- 1 guides thalamocortical development. </p...|$|E
40|$|Various {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} development and evolution of the mammalian isocortex cannot be easily explained without an understanding of correlative changes in surrounding areas of the telencephalic pallium and subpallium. These are close neighbours in a common morphogenetic field and are postulated as sources of some cortical neuron types (and even of whole cortical areas). There is equal need to explain relevant developmental evolutionary changes in the dorsal thalamus, {{the major source of}} afferent inputs to the telencephalon (to both the pallium and subpallium). The mammalian isocortex evolved within an initially small dorsal part of the pallium of vertebrates, surrounded by other pallial parts, including some with a non-cortical, nuclear structure. Nuclear pallial elements are markedly voluminous in reptiles and birds, where they build the dorsal ventricular ridge, or hypopallium, which has been recently divided molecularly and structurally into a lateral pallium and a ventral pallium. Afferent pallial connections are often simplified as consisting of thalamic fibres that project either to focal cell aggregates in the ventral pallium (predominant in reptiles and birds) or to corticoid areas in the dorsal pallium (predominant in mammals). Karten's hypothesis, put forward in 1969, on the formation of some isocortical areas postulates an embryonic translocation into the nascent isocortex of the ventropallial thalamorecipient foci and respective downstream ventropallial target populations, as specific layer IV, layers II- III, or layers V-VI neuron populations. This view is considered critically in the light of various recent data, contrasting with the alternative possibility of a parallel, separate evolution of the different pallial parts. The new scenario reveals as well a separately evolving tiered structure of the dorsal thalamus, some of whose parts receive input from midbrain sensory centres (collothalamic nuclei), whereas other parts receive oligosynaptic 'lemniscal' connections bypassing the midbrain (lemnothalamic nuclei). An ampler look into known hodological patterns from this viewpoint suggests that ancient collothalamic pathways, which target ventropallial foci, are largely conserved in mammals, while some emergent cortical connections can be established by means of new collaterals in some of these pathways. The lemnothalamic pathways, which typically target ancestrally the dorsopallial isocortex, show parallel increments of relative size and structural diversification of both the <b>thalamic</b> <b>cell</b> populations and the cortical recipient areas. The evolving lemnothalamic pathways may interact developmentally with collothalamic corticopetal collaterals in the modality-specific invasion of the emergent new areas of isocortex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A silicon {{model of}} the thalamic low {{threshold}} calcium current is presented. The channel current (IT) {{is the product of}} an activation and inactivation current, normalized by their sum. The individual currents are modeled by a simple current-mirror integrator circuit. A modified differential pair controls the threshold of activation while a leak transistor added to the inactivation mirror controls the rate of inactivation and deinactivation. The dynamics of IT are the result of the interaction between the fast activation and slow inactivation currents. By adjusting the base level of the activation current, we can realize a hyperpolarization activated cation current (I h), responsible for rhythmic bursting in <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells.</b> By attaching the circuit to a constant leak integrate-and-fire neuron, we demonstrate in silicon both burst and tonic firing modes.

40|$|Action {{potentials}} are {{a universal}} currency for fast information transfer in the nervous system, yet few studies address how some spikes carry {{more information than}} others. We focused on the transformation of sensory representations in the lemnis-cal (high-fidelity) auditory thalamocortical network. While stim-ulating with a complex sound, we recorded simultaneously from functionally connected cell pairs in the ventral medial genicu-late body and primary auditory cortex. Thalamic action poten-tials that immediately preceded or potentially caused a cortical spike were more selective than the average thalamic spike for spectrotemporal stimulus features. This net improvement of thalamic signaling indicates that for some <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells,</b> spikes are not propagated through cortex independently but interact with other inputs onto the same target cell. We then developed a method to identify the spectrotemporal nature of these inter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Thalamic neurons have an {{exclusive}} property named bursting response. Bursting response {{seems to have}} a critical role in producing saliency map and encoding conspicuity of locations during visual attention. Attention window is developed in thalamus due to its retinotopic organization. The global competitive network in thalamic reticular nucleus (NRT) determines which <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells</b> should produce bursting response. These cells are corresponded with attention window or attended location in the visual field. The computational procedure of bursting response is studied by the means of neurobiological modeling of thalamic neurons and their bimodal behavior (periodic bursting and periodic spiking patterns). The effect of NRT on thalamic relay neurons is considered in each mode of thalamic response. We also achieved the results of modeling through computer simulation of bimodal behavior in thalamic neurons...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2017. Every night, {{the human}} brain {{produces}} thousands of downstates and spindles during non-REM sleep. Previous studies indicate that spindles originate thalamically and downstates cortically, loosely grouping spindle occurrence. However, the mechanisms whereby the thalamus and cortex interact in generating these sleep phenomena remain poorly understood. Using bipolar depth recordings, we report here a sequence wherein: (1) convergent cortical downstates lead thalamic downstates; (2) thalamic downstates hyperpolarize <b>thalamic</b> <b>cells,</b> thus triggering spindles; and (3) thalamic spindles are focally projected back to cortex, arriving during the down-to-upstate transition when the cortex replays memories. Thalamic intrinsic currents, therefore, may not be continuously available during non-REM sleep, permitting the cortex to control thalamic spindling by inducing downstates. This archetypical cortico-thalamo-cortical sequence could provide the global physiological context for memory consolidation during non-REM sleep...|$|R
