5|$|East Tilbury, {{which stands}} at {{the western end of}} the section of the Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers.

5|$|On March 28, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} {{started when}} several hundred rebels marched into Saigon {{dressed all in}} white, armed with only sticks and spears.

The police raided the homes of several people who {{were known to be}} involved with Long's plot, resulting in more arrests. They captured most of Long's main supporters, rendering the organisation impotent. However, Tri managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ovarian {{cycle in}} which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates {{the production of a}} large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E

5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes {{the lining of}} the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|Luna, repenting for his blunder {{during the}} end of the first phase during Philippine Revolution, which ended at the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, then {{prepared}} himself for the second phase. Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|Operation Southern Move was to {{be carried}} out in two stages. The first stage {{involved}} the capture of Mrkonjić Grad and the surrounding Podrašnica Valley.

The whole operation was planned to take four days, immediately preceding a country-wide ceasefire scheduled to take effect on the morning of 12 October 1995. According to Brigadier Ante Kotromanović, then commander of the 126th Home Guard Regiment, the offensive was approved by the United States, and U.S. warplanes attacked VRS positions near Banja Luka in preparation of the offensive.|$|E
