5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark.

This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
