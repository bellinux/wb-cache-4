5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep geothermal well was used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{hot water}} systems use {{sunlight}} <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> water. In low geographical latitudes (below 40degrees) from 60 to 70% {{of the domestic}} hot water use with temperatures up to 60°C can be provided by solar heating systems. The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed flat plate collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> swimming pools.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E

Specific inhalation challenge testing resulted in late or dual asthmatic reactions <b>to</b> <b>heated</b> TGIC {{in four of}} four tested and was negative in three control asthmatics. One worker tested only with unheated TGIC had a negative specific challenge test. Heated TGIC can cause occupational asthma from bystander exposure...|$|R

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} the second most used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia but represents less than 1% of the total energy production. The first geothermal power plant in Russia was built at Pauzhetka, Kamchatka, in 1966, with a capacity of 5MW. The total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79MW, with 50MW coming from a plant at Verkhne-Mutnovsky. Russia is currently developing a 100MW plant at Mutnovsky and a 50MW plant in Kaliningrad. Most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the North Caucasus and Kamchatka. Half of the geothermal production is used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> homes and industrial buildings, one third is used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> greenhouses and 13% is used for industrial processes.|$|E
5|$|Iceland is {{the world}} leader in direct applications. Some 92.5% of its homes are heated with {{geothermal}} energy, saving Iceland over $100 million annually in avoided oil imports. Reykjavík, Iceland has the world's biggest district heating system, often used <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> pathways and roads to hinder the accumulation of ice. Once known as the most polluted city in the world, it {{is now one of}} the cleanest.|$|E

40|$|There are {{basically}} {{three categories of}} equipment used <b>to</b> manage <b>heat</b> energy flows in an industrial process. First, heat exchangers are used <b>to</b> move <b>heat</b> through the process down the temperature gradient. Second, heat pumps are used <b>to</b> move <b>heat</b> through the process up the temperature gradient. Third, heat engines are used <b>to</b> convert <b>heat</b> <b>to</b> shaft power or electricity. The subject here is heat pumps, {{and they will be}} discussed relative to their potential for heat energy conservation in industrial processes. The large categories of applications in refrigeration and space heating are not addressed...|$|R

5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules was needed to carry coal <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E
