5|$|The episode borrows {{heavily from}} the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None. The opening scene of the episode {{is similar to that}} of Stanley Kubrik's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, {{wondering}} if television host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} shots of several skyscrapers in New York, which are {{followed}} by scenes of the band performing in a warehouse that has {{been converted into a}} stage (similar to Vino's bar which is where the band used to regularly perform before they became popular). The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the Brooklyn Bridge. During the bridge of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing on her feet. At the end of the video, the band meet up and walk to the beach where <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the sea. The final shot shows the band walking in the sea as the video fades out.|$|E

500|$|While searching <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> {{a theater}} {{featuring}} a romantic film. As they watch a couple kissing {{on the big}} screen, their silhouettes block some of the screen, as a man shouts at them down and front. An usher comes in as the babies hide around the seats to avoid being caught, inadvertently interrupting a couple having a date in the process.

500|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, the perspective changes from Will's, to Sarah's, to Mary's {{and finally to}} Harry's. Players passively select whether they see Sarah's or Mary's story first through a hidden choice (which room <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> first early in the game). It becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also those of other characters and how they cope with his death. During Sarah's portrayal she says [...] "Let me set the scene..." [...] and during {{this part of the}} game the player clicks on objects that slowly turn the setting into a pub. After a few pieces of dialogue, the player clicks again to make it all disappear. During Harry's section, the player clicks on objects that remind Harry of Will. In some parts of the game, the player clicks on other characters to make them move forward, suggesting the idea of snapshots based on their memories. Once the player has clicked on enough objects, a meter becomes full and that triggers the next part of the game.|$|E

2500|$|Though a {{successful}} model, the concept {{has been criticized}} for hindering the growth of characters' relationships with other love interests; this has resulted in alternate definitions for the term. In her essay criticism of the term, The Siren Call of the Super Couple (ed. Suzanne Frentz, 1992), Diana Reep describes the love of a supercouple as [...] "so perfect that they are incapable of having romantic feelings for anyone else under any circumstances. In addition, the two have no personal flaws or idiosyncrasies that could interfere with their perfect love. Only an evil, outside force could disturb their relationship". While Days of Our Lives former supervising producer Al Rabin credited the supercouple aspect as the secret to the show's success, his then-executive producer Ken Corday stated, [...] "By definition, supercouple excludes others on the show. Every time <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a room, every other character, no matter how important, becomes window dressing, I've never believed in it." [...] Corday added, [...] "Either people are involved in a good story or they're not. They're an interesting couple or they're not." ...|$|E
50|$|Indie game Fragments of Him also {{begins in}} medias res but, in {{addition}} to the nonlinear beginning, it later jumps between characters to build the story and character relationships in a nonlinear fashion, and a subtle branch means that players may see the stories in a different order if <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a different room at the beginning.|$|E
