5|$|Little {{is known}} about John's early life. His father was a wealthy {{official}} in the imperial palace. John himself was born at Dokeia (now Tokat), {{in the region of}} Darbidos in the Armeniac Theme, and was educated by one of his relatives, the bishop of Gangra Christopher. In the late regency of Empress Zoe Karbonopsina (914–919) for her infant son Constantine VII (r. 913–959), Kourkouas was appointed as the commander of the Vigla palace guard regiment, probably through the machinations of the fellow Armenian, admiral Romanos Lekapenos, as part of his drive for the throne. In this capacity, he arrested several high officials who opposed Lekapenos's rise to power, opening the road to the appointment of Lekapenos as regent in place of Zoe in 919. Lekapenos gradually assumed more powers until he was crowned senior emperor in December 920. As a reward for his support, in ca. 923, Romanos Lekapenos promoted Kourkouas to the post of Domestic of <b>the</b> <b>Schools,</b> <b>in</b> effect commander-in-chief of all the imperial armies in Anatolia. According to the chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus, Kourkouas held this post for an unparalleled continuous term of 22years and seven months.|$|E
