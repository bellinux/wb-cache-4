5|$|The {{episode was}} written by head writer Neil Cross. It was also {{additionally}} written by Ben Richards. The plot of the episode {{was influenced by the}} resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways is threatening the security of the West. The producers also included scenes <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> Lucas adjusting to the outside world following eight years of imprisonment, to show how emotionally damaged the character is, and make the audience realise he is struggling. One of the scenes include Lucas struggling to sleep on a bed, and soon resorts to lying on the floor instead.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook {{estimates that the}} overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{received}} the commission for the Reader's Digest Building from Mrs DeWitt Wallace {{on his return}} from Japan in 1949. She wanted a design <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> the best that America could offer. The site acquired for the building was opposite the Hirakawa Gate of the Imperial Palace. Its choice was treated with great resentment by the Japanese who felt that favouritism was shown by the Occupation authorities in allowing an American company to utilise a prominent site that would have served better as a park. Taking influence from Le Corbusier, Raymond responded to this criticism by masterplanning the site by using a Ville Radieuse inspired layout with the building set in gardens with sculptures by the Japanese American sculptor, Isamu Noguchi.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

25|$|The {{possibility}} of extraterrestrial life is not, by itself, a paranormal subject. Many scientists are {{actively engaged in}} the search for unicellular life within the solar system, carrying out studies on the surface of Mars and examining meteors that have fallen to Earth. Projects such as SETI are conducting an astronomical search for radio activity <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. Scientific theories of how life developed on Earth allow for the possibility that life developed on other planets as well. The paranormal aspect of extraterrestrial life centers largely around the belief in unidentified flying objects and the phenomena said to be associated with them.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{capacity}} of Old Trafford {{at the time was}} over 76,000, this was substantially reduced for the game due to the installation of two giant screens <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> a pre-match video featuring clips of Manchester United's involvement in European matches over the previous 50 years. By the weekend before the game, 70,000 tickets had been sold at £17 for adults, half-price for over-65s and £5 for under-16s. The capacity for the match was reportedly capped at 72,000; however, the attendance reported after the game was in excess of 74,000. Proceeds from ticket sales went towards the Manchester United Foundation, a group working towards improving the lives of young people in the local community using football.|$|E

25|$|A two-part {{comic book}} story, {{serving as a}} {{companion}} to the movie sequel, was released in May 2010. The series is written by Troy Duffy, produced by Innfusion Inc. and released through 12 Gauge Comics. The Book focuses on a more in depth version of Il Duce's back story as well as {{telling the story of}} the brothers during a hit they performed that is not featured in the film. It was paired with a mini book that was featured on the official Boondock Saints website that told a mini-story that takes place before the strip club scene from the first film. These will eventually be released in one single graphic novel. Another story is currently being proposed <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> the brothers' time in Hoag Prison after the events of All Saints Day.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the cord spin twist wrapped on the paddle is either S, left to right, or Z, right to left. The type appears in E Virginia earlier (a mix of twist pre-200 CE), and through to Vermont {{after the end of}} the Middle Woodland period about CE 800. During the Sponemann phase (750-800 CE), Sponemann Site is the type site for non-American Bottom migrants making a high amount of Z-Twist pottery using chert for temper. These non-residents are a significant influx into the area with the first significant evidence for maize before the occurrence of the cities of Cahokia people. The other dominant phase in the region of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers confluence is the Patrick Phase. These people existed from 1350-1150 BP. Like Sponemann people, they were more complex than bands, but, less complex than chiefdoms and the indicators are not present <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> a ranking and stratification society). Patrick Phase pottery is marked predominantly with S-twist cordage.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 {{evidence}} uncovered {{during an}} investigation by The Guardian newspaper and Guardian Films linked the Quds Force to the kidnappings of five Britons from a government ministry building in Baghdad in 2007. Four of the hostages, Jason Creswell, Jason Swindlehurst, Alec Maclachlan, and Alan McMenemy, were killed. Peter Moore was released on 30 December 2009. The investigation uncovered evidence that Moore, 37, a computer expert from Lincoln was targeted because he was installing a system for the Iraqi Government <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> how {{a vast amount of}} international aid was diverted to Iran's militia groups in Iraq. One of the alleged groups funded by the Quds force directly is the Righteous League, which emerged in 2006 and has stayed largely in the shadows as a proxy of the Quds Force. Shia cleric and leading figure of the Righteous League, Qais al-Khazali, was handed over by the U.S. military for release by the Iraqi government on 29 December 2009 {{as part of the deal}} that led to the release of Moore.|$|E

25|$|The 1991 {{release of}} Sonic the Hedgehog, {{the first game}} in the Sonic series, was a major {{commercial}} success, and positioned Sega as Nintendo's main rival in the console market. However, lead programmer Yuji Naka had grown dissatisfied with Sega's rigid corporate policies {{and moved to the}} United States to work with Sega Technical Institute, along with several members of Sonic Team, to develop Sonic the Hedgehog 2. At the same time, Sega was planning to release the Sega CD, a hardware add-on for the Sega Genesis, and wanted a Sonic game <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> off its more advanced features. Thus, a separate team in Japan led by Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima began developing an enhanced port of Sonic 2 for the Sega CD codenamed Super Sonic. It was to feature additional levels, a fully orchestrated soundtrack, sprite-scaling effects, and animated cutscenes. However, after lower-than-expected sales of Sonic 2 in Japan, Super Sonic was split into a separate game and retitled CD Sonic the Hedgehog and later as simply Sonic CD.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{opted to}} hire actors who had, or could imitate, American accents. After over 3,000 {{individuals}} in the United Kingdom were unsuccessfully auditioned, American actors were chosen instead, including three who had previously worked with Cameron on The Terminator: Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Michael Biehn. Actors who played marines were asked to read Starship Troopers and undergo military training, which included running, lifting weights, learning salutes, marches, deployments, and maneuvers, for two weeks. Cameron wanted the marines to train together {{so that they would}} form bonds <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> on-screen. Sigourney Weaver, William Hope, and Paul Reiser were absent from training because of other obligations, but Cameron felt that this suited their characters as [...] "outsiders" [...] in the film.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 he met author David Hall. [...] Hall {{had been}} raised in the Bradford {{district}} of Manchester and the two swapped tales {{of growing up in}} the latter half of the 20th century. [...] Hall suggested that Dibnah would be unlikely to have any further television work commissioned on his life and that he should consider becoming a television presenter. [...] The two worked on new ideas for a programme <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> Dibnah touring the country, visiting important historical locations and speaking to the men involved in the maintenance and restoration of industrial machinery and architecture. [...] The programme would also exploit Dibnah's working-class attitude and show him operating some of the machinery he visited. [...] Filming of Fred Dibnah's Industrial Age began in July 1998. [...] The first location was near Bolton, at the Wet Earth Colliery and the crew then moved on to various locations around the country, continuing to film through the summer and autumn of 1998.|$|E

500|$|For The King of Fighters XIII, K's {{design was}} crafted {{so that he}} had a [...] "cool" [...] appearance. Developers liked the result as his moves, such as putting on his sunglasses, were {{carefully}} detailed. His gameplay mechanics were developed so that gamers who had used him before would not find his new gameplay mechanics strange. In contrast to Kyo's flames, K's were designed with intention of making them look more violent. As a result of various The King of Fighters endings showing K' removing his red glove, a special move was required to show him doing the same thing. After thinking of several methods <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> this, the staff was inspired by The King of Fighters HK Comics printed adaptations in which the character's glove once broke after defeating his opponent, leading to his winpose that happens only after he has used his strongest technique. Following various revisions of K's [...] technique, in order to better follow the material that inspired the move, the staff decided to make K' fight while wearing his sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, FormGen {{contacted}} id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, {{along with a}} Death Cam <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>show</b> a replay {{of the death of}} the final boss of an episode. The team also added [...] "Horst-Wessel-Lied", the anthem of the Nazi Party, to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to bulletin board systems. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.|$|E

William and Ima moved into the house, which she christened Bayou Bend, in 1928. In 1939, when she restored her estate along American lines, she donated more than 100works on paper to Houston's Museum of Fine Arts (MFAH), including works by Cézanne, Sargent, Picasso, and Klee. Following the death of her brother Michael in 1941, she donated his collection of Frederic Remington works to the museum. Consisting of 53 oil paintings, 10watercolors, and one bronze, it is known as the Hogg Brothers Collection, and is [...] "one of the most important groupings of Western paintings on display in an American museum", according to Hogg biographer Neely.
