5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>over.</b> Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E

He was also concerned that white support for black demands within the community was declining and that race relations were near <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

50|$|Maja blanca is {{relatively}} easy to prepare. A coconut milk (not coconut cream) and cornstarch mixture is heated <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> a low flame while stirring. Agar (gulaman in Filipino) can be substituted for cornstarch. Corn kernels, milk, and sugar are also often added, though these are not traditionally part of the recipe. Once the mixture thickens, it is then poured into serving dishes previously greased with coconut oil and allowed to cool. Once firm, latik (browned coconut cream curds) are then sprinkled as toppings.|$|E

5000|$|As Wolverine and Daredevil {{infiltrate}} the M.O.M Helicarrier, Iron Man contacts the Mighty Avengers who are {{en route to}} prevent the super-villain Tiger Shark from attacking a coastal missile base. Tiger Shark has stolen the so-called [...] "Horn of Gabriel" [...] from Atlantis, which can summon terrible sea monsters to his side. During the fight Tiger Shark boasts that he'll finally gain the respect he deserves and a furious Ms. Marvel begins to savagely beat him until the Sub-Mariner arrives to calm the raging monsters. Condemning the brutality used by them against both Tiger Shark and the sea monsters as an outlet for their anger regarding Cap's death, Namor takes Tiger Shark into custody and reveals he learned there are missiles hidden in the coastline of Maine. As Namor warns the Mighty Avengers that he will retaliate if Atlantis is ever attacked, Ares asks Ms. Marvel if they won and if so then {{that was all that}} mattered. Meanwhile, the Thing joins a poker game organized by the New Avengers along with Young Avengers Patriot and Hawkeye at the Sanctum Sanctorum. Tensions are running high and conversation soon turns to Cap's death and recent events caused by the Civil War. Sensing how close things are <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>over,</b> Patriot and Hawkeye leave the game to take out their frustration on some bad guys just as Wolverine returns from his quest aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Wolverine informs the other Avengers that he saw Cap's body. Wolverine and Spider-Man get into a dispute, The Thing separates them and points out that fighting each other won't alleviate either of their pain regarding the loss of someone like Cap. Spider-Man leaves the game and Wolverine shadows him to make sure the webslinger gets home safe while the others decide to resume playing rather than discuss it any further.|$|E

6000|$|The letter {{which follows}} is a fair sample of Mark Twain's private [...] {{violence}} on a subject which, in public print, he could only treat [...] effectively by preserving his good humor.

50|$|After the war ended, racial {{tensions}} began <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> in the United States. Having experienced freedom and respect in France {{they had never}} known at home, African American soldiers returned to find that discrimination against blacks was just as present {{as it was before}} the war. A prime, but not isolated, example of this lingering racism is the case of African American soldier Wilbur Little. He was lynched in Blakely, Georgia upon his return from service after ignoring warnings from a group of white men to never wear his uniform in public.|$|R

The Colonel's face was empurpled, the Colonel's chest was efflorescent and bursting, the Colonel had the general effect of being about <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> the top button of his coat, but his manner was jauntily and daintily precise.|$|R
60|$|The truth is, that Junkie {{possessed a}} nature that was tightly strung and vibrated like an Aeolian harp to the lightest breath of influence. He resembled, somewhat, {{a pot of}} milk on a very hot fire, rather apt <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> with a rush; nevertheless, he possessed the power to {{restrain}} himself in a simmering condition for a considerable length of time. The {{fact that he was}} fairly out for the day with two strangers, to whom he was to show the pools where salmon and sea-trout lay, was a prospect so charming that he was quite content to simmer.|$|R
25|$|Following the Congress of Vienna, Austria {{became part}} of the German Confederation till the Austro-Prussian war of 1866.

This succeeded in reducing but not removing nationalist tensions, which were <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> with the 1914 assassination of the Austrian heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, and the ensuing chain reaction resulting in the First World War.

50|$|When the Chechens and Ingush {{returned}} to their homeland, they found other peoples living, quite literally, in their homes, and viewed these other ethnicities (Ossetians, Russians, Laks, Kumyks and Avars) with hostility. Conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush in Prigorodny, and between Russians/Cossacks and Chechens in northern Chechnya, simmered and threatened <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> into violence many times. In the case of Akkia, there was more understanding between the two sides, not because of their historical contacts and shared religion, but rather because the Chechens knew that the Dagestanis had not moved onto their land by choice, but rather were forced to. However, the dispute over Akkia was not resolved, despite efforts by both sides to find a middle ground.|$|R
