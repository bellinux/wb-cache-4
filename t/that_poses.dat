50|$|CBP has {{initiated}} new programs {{to aid in}} counter terrorist efforts by creating the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism (C-TPAT). The CSI consists of four core elements: Using intelligence and automated information to identify and target containers <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a risk for terrorism, pre-screening those containers <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a risk {{at the port of}} departure before they arrive at U.S. ports, using detection technology to quickly pre-screen containers <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a risk, and using smarter, tamper-evident containers. Under C-TPAT, shippers commit to improving the security of their cargo shipments, and in return, they receive a variety of benefits from the government.|$|R

25|$|A hazard is any biological, chemical, physical, {{mechanical}} {{or environmental}} agent or situation <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> {{a level of}} threat to life, health, property, or environment. The presence {{of a combination of}} several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{there have}} been cases of {{epidemics}} in which the species infected cultivars of maize and sugarcane and decimated the populations, causing up to $23 million US dollars’ worth of damage. Because of this, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has included Philippine downy mildew on its Plant Pathogen Select Agent List, being a pathogen <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> a great threat for American plants, both wild and cultivated.|$|E
25|$|Extraordinary for its {{dramatic}} {{power and}} the nobility of its musical content, Maometto II is also an opera <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> many textual problems, since Rossini's successive revisions were made directly in the autograph score.

25|$|Western Oregon's mountainous regions, home {{to three}} of the most {{prominent}} mountain peaks of the United States including Mount Hood, were formed by the volcanic activity of the Juan de Fuca Plate, a tectonic plate <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> a continued threat of volcanic activity and earthquakes in the region. The most recent major activity was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Washington's Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, an event visible from northern Oregon and affecting some areas there.|$|E
25|$|Achatinidae are {{a family}} of rather large land snails, and, {{in spite of their}} size, one <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> {{tremendous}} taxonomic problems, and Dolf {{is one of the few}} people who knows his way in the chaotic taxonomy of this group. He devoted various papers partly or wholly to the family and introduced six new species and subspecies. He was a friend of the recently deceased American Achatinidae specialist Albert Raymond Mead (1915–2009). They regularly exchanged opinions, but did not publish jointly.|$|E
25|$|A {{primary concern}} of the bite of a spider {{is the effect of}} its venom. A spider {{envenomation}} occurs whenever a spider injects venom into the skin. Not all spider bites involve injection of venom, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The mechanical injury from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans. However, it is generally the toxicity of spider venom <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> the most risk to human beings; several spiders are known to have venom that can cause injury to humans in the amounts that a spider could inject when biting.|$|E

25|$|A hazard is any {{agent or}} {{situation}} <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> {{a level of}} threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards remain dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, and when a hazard becomes active, and produces undesirable consequences, it is called an incident and may culminate in an emergency or accident. Hazard and vulnerability interact with likelihood of occurrence to create risk, which can be {{the probability of a}} specific undesirable consequence of a specific hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of a specific activity. A hazard that is understood and acknowledged may present a lower risk if appropriate precautions are taken, and the consequences may be less severe if mitigation procedures are planned and in place.|$|E
25|$|According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder {{from the}} Center for Responsible Nanotechnology {{as well as}} Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute {{molecular}} manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology <b>that</b> <b>poses</b> the most significant global catastrophic risk. Several nanotechnology researchers state {{that the bulk of}} risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government. Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade, a potential peace-promoting factor; (5) wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.|$|E

The conclusion is that, overall, Canadians tend to export more to those countries where their patent rights are highly safeguarded.

In addition, the effect of stronger patent rights is to increase exports to those countries <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> a strong threat of imitation and to reduce exports to those countries <b>that</b> <b>pose</b> the weakest threat of imitation. ...|$|R
