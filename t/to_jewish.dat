5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting {{the use of}} the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E

5|$|The first Rugrats Jewish holiday special was {{suggested}} {{to the production}} staff in 1992 by Nickelodeon executives as a special devoted to Hanukkah.

Each holiday special achieved high viewing numbers according to Nielsen Media Research and received positive reviews. However, Jewish character Grandpa Boris' portrayal in a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for apparent antisemitism.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{restored}} {{many of the}} old {{financial institutions}} of his grandfather Henry I and undertook further, long-lasting reforms of the way that the English currency was managed; one result was a long-term increase in the supply of money within the economy, leading to a growth both in trade and inflation. Medieval rulers such as Henry enjoyed various sources of income during the 12th century. Some of their income came from their private estates, called demesne; other income came from imposing legal fines and arbitrary amercements, and from taxes, which at this time were raised only intermittently. Kings could also raise funds by borrowing; Henry did this far more than earlier English rulers, initially through moneylenders in Rouen, turning later in his reign <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> and Flemish lenders. Ready cash was increasingly important to rulers during the 12th century to enable the use of mercenary forces and the construction of stone castles, both vital to successful military campaigns.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E

5|$|Manstein {{took part}} in a conference on 22 August 1939 where Hitler {{underlined}} to his commanders the need for the physical destruction of Poland as a nation. After the war, he would state in his memoirs that he did not recognise {{at the time of this}} meeting that Hitler was going to pursue a policy of extermination against the Poles. He did become aware of the policy later on, as he and other Wehrmacht generals received reports on the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, the Schutzstaffel (SS) death squads tasked with following the army into Poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians. These squads were also assigned to round up Jews and others for relocation to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. Manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> and civilian deaths in the sectors under his control, and the mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of those}} killed at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 Romani people also died there. Like the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up {{and sent to the}} ghettos; at a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be {{deported}} to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent <b>to</b> <b>Jewish</b> ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most Romani who went to Treblinka died in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be executed; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were shot on the spot. There were no known Romani escapees or survivors from Treblinka.|$|E

Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
