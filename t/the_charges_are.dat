Janine {{attempts}} to blackmail Ian, and when he rebuffs her, she tells the police about the recording and the laptop, leading to his arrest. Ian admits to stealing the laptop from The Queen Victoria on Christmas Day, but denies murder. The police charge him with murder, but when Janine admits the truth, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> dropped.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers {{acting on}} behalf of Falun Gong {{practitioners}} have filed dozens of largely symbolic lawsuits around the world against Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity. According to International Advocates for Justice, Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> among the most severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws. As of 2006, 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> high, {{and the distance}} between the nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E

25|$|In general, if a {{defendant}} is found incompetent {{to proceed to}} trial, the criminal proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> petty, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the defendant is usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the defendant is restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|E

25|$|Since journalism {{relies on}} the public trust, a reporter's failure to {{honestly}} acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility.

25|$|When {{a charge}} {{or group of}} charges is placed across a {{division}} line, variation, or ordinary, it may be counterchanged (Fr. contre-changé, but modern de l'un en l'autre, Ger. verwechselte Farben or verschränkte Farben), meaning that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> divided {{the same way as}} the field upon which they rest, with the colours reversed.|$|E
25|$|The TIP3P model {{implemented}} in the CHARMM force field is a slightly {{modified version of the}} original. The difference lies in the Lennard-Jones parameters: unlike TIP3P, the CHARMM version of the model places Lennard-Jones parameters on the hydrogen atoms too, in addition to the one on oxygen. <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> not modified. Three-site model (TIP3P) has better performance in calculating specific heats.|$|E

On February 17, 2005, the then-district attorney, Bruce Castor, had released a statement that charges would not be laid at that time.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{by refusing}} to rule on the charges themselves, {{the court did not}} clarify the proper {{disposition}} of criminal charges pending against a person whose competency can not be restored. This means that in those states where <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> not dismissed, the individual may not be converted to a civil status eligible for civil commitment, resulting in such an individuals continued confinement in a secure prison with little opportunity for treatment and fewer privileges.|$|E
25|$|Once an atom {{is heated}} above its {{ionization}} energy, its electrons are stripped away (it is ionized), leaving just the bare nucleus (the ion). The {{result is a}} hot cloud of ions and the electrons formerly attached to them. This cloud {{is known as a}} plasma. Because <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> separated, plasmas are electrically conductive and magnetically controllable. Many fusion devices take advantage of this to control the particles as they are heated.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, the MCSA laid {{undisclosed}} internal {{charges against}} Verryn, {{and after a}} hearing he was suspended on 19 January 2010. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> initially undisclosed did nothing to quell the rumours that {{the real reason for}} <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>was</b> that there was substance to the accusations which had been made. A statement was later released that the basis for <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> had <b>been</b> that Verryn had exceeded his authority.|$|R
5000|$|On October 22, 2007, the Holy Land Foundation trial {{ended in}} a mistrial.

The pressure of air within the apparatus being reduced to 1.9 inches of mercury, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> found to be 29°; then letting in air till the pressure <b>was</b> 30 inches, <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> <b>was</b> still 29°.|$|R
25|$|Bonds {{pleaded not}} guilty on December 7, 2007 and was freed on bond while {{awaiting}} trial. On January 23, 2008, Bonds filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, asserting that <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> vague and allege more than one offense in each count, which may violate his constitutional rights. In a response from the government on February 14, 2008, prosecutors stated that they would present evidence at trial showing that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2000.|$|E

25|$|Paneb {{was accused}} of many charges of sexual assault and adultery, though there are many ambiguities in the text which make {{the exact nature of}} the charges unclear. <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> special in that they are alleged by his son Aapehty to the door-keepers, who are the people who stand {{at the door of the}} tomb at work-sites, but also serve various other functions, {{including}} possible legal functions. Though Černý seems to think that the door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G. McDowell, a prominent Egyptologist in the study of Deir el-Medina, speculates that the door-keepers' legal function was small, and that Aapehty only testified to them because they stood in a public part of the worksite.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1679 Pepys was elected MP for Harwich in Charles II's third parliament which formed part of the Cavalier Parliament. He was elected along with Sir Anthony Deane, a Harwich alderman and leading naval architect, to whom Pepys had been patron since 1662. By May of that year, they were under attack from their political enemies. Pepys resigned as Secretary to the Admiralty. They were imprisoned in the Tower of London on suspicion of treasonable correspondence with France, specifically leaking naval intelligence. <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to have been}} fabricated under the direction of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Pepys was accused, among other things, of being a papist. They were released in July, but proceedings against them were not dropped until June 1680.|$|E
25|$|Zuma {{has faced}} {{significant}} legal challenges. He {{was charged with}} rape in 2005, but was acquitted. He fought a long legal battle over allegations of racketeering and corruption, resulting from his financial advisor Schabir Shaik's conviction for corruption and fraud. On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority dropped the charges, citing political interference, although the decision was successfully challenged by opposition parties, and <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> <b>are</b> now before the NPA for reconsideration. After extensive state-funded upgrades to his rural homestead at Nkandla, the Public Protector found that Zuma had benefited improperly from the expenditure, and the Constitutional Court unanimously held in 2016's Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly that Zuma had failed to uphold the country's constitution, resulting in calls for his resignation and a failed impeachment attempt in the National Assembly.|$|E
