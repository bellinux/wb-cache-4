40|$|In this paper, an {{original}} method about heavy vehicles rollover risk prediction is presented and validated experimentally. It {{is based on}} the calculation of the LTR (Load Transfer Ratio) which depends on the estimated vertical forces using high order sliding mode observers. Previously, a tractor model is developed. The validation tests were carried out on an instrumented <b>tractor</b> <b>rolling</b> on the road at various speeds and lane-change manoeuvres. Many scenarios have been experienced: driving on straight line, curve line, zigzag and brake tests to emphasize the rollover phenomenon and its prediction to set off an alarm to the driver. In this study, the vehicle dynamic parameters (Masses, Inertias, stiffness [...] ) and the static forces infrastructure characteristics (road profile, radius of curvature, longitudinal and lateral slope, skid resistance) are measured or calculated before the tests...|$|E
40|$|On Tuesday, April 16 th, 2002, a 72 -year-old {{part-time}} farmer died as {{a result}} of a tractor overturn. The victim had been brush-hogging the outer edge of a pasture when the tractor was driven onto an embankment that gave way, causing the tractor to roll over. The tractor rolled down the embankment, crushing the operator during the initial 180 degrees of rolling. His brother, who heard the crashing sound of the <b>tractor</b> <b>rolling</b> down the embankment, discovered the victim soon after and had someone call the emergency squad, which responded within minutes. The county coroner was called and pronounced the victim dead at the scene. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) investigators concluded that to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the following recommendations should be followed: • Equip all tractors with rollover protective structures (ROPS) and a seatbelt; • Evaluate the terrain prior to beginning an operation with a tractor, and mark hidden hazards for visibility; • Provide workers with age appropriate tasks...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the sixth {{in a series}} that {{estimates}} {{the number of workers}} and bystanders killed each year due to work-related injury.   This report shows that there has been little change in the number of workers killed each with 286 workers killed in 2008 - 09, 100 of which were due to traffic incidents on public roads. In addition 117 workers died while travelling to or from work and 41 members of the general public were killed due to someone else 2 ̆ 7 s work activity. Truck drivers and workers on farms are the groups most at risk of being killed while working. The report said that 358 truck drivers have been killed while working over the six years until 30 June 2009. In an associated report also just released, Safe Work Australia has found that 65 workers were killed in the four years from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2007 due to working with tractors. The major cause of death was due to being run over by the tractor which accounted for 25 of the deaths. The report found that the number of workers killed due to the <b>tractor</b> <b>rolling</b> over has reduced from 40 in the 1989 - 92 period to 17 in the 2004 - 07 period. This improvement has been linked to the introduction of rollover protection structures on tractors built after 1981.

25|$|The driver at {{no point}} saw or heard Corrie. She was {{standing}} behind debris which obstructed {{the view of the}} driver and the driver had a very limited field of vision due to the protective cage he was working in.... The driver and his commanders were interrogated extensively {{over a long period of}} time with the use of polygraph tests and video evidence. They had no knowledge that she was standing in the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie's body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the <b>tractor</b> physically <b>rolling</b> over her. It was a tragic accident that never should have happened.|$|R
5000|$|One {{improvement}} {{made was}} the track laying design. This type of <b>tractor</b> moved on <b>rolling</b> tracks instead of wheels. He made several different models, but two really stood out as notable. The two models [...] - [...] the 30 hp field tractor, and the 60 hp field tractor [...] - [...] were well received and highly praised by the farming community. These tractors would eventually {{launch a new}} line of tractors that are still used today.|$|R

5000|$|Cockshutt {{had always}} {{intended}} {{to sell its}} new Model 30 {{beyond the borders of}} Canada. The company especially wanted to enter the large farm tractor market south of the border in the United States. However, Cockshutt had no sales network in the United States. Consequently in 1945, Cockshutt signed two marketing agreements with United States organizations. The first agreement was signed with the National Farm Machinery Co-operative (NFMC) in the midwestern United States. [...] Under the terms of this agreement the Model 30 tractors sold in the United States would be sold under the [...] "Co-op" [...] name. The tractors would be painted entirely [...] "pumpkin orange" [...] with black lettering and would be re-designated as the Co-op Model E-3 tractor. The NFMC would wholesale the Model E-3 tractors to various local farmer-owned co-operatives. These local farmer-owned co-operatives, spread over 10 states in the midwestern part of the United States, would then retail the Model E-3 tractors to the consuming farming public. [...] Some of these locally owned farmer-owned co-operatives, especially those located in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, were affiliated with the American Farm Bureau. By October 1946 the new orange Model E-3 <b>tractors</b> were <b>rolling</b> off the assembly line at the Brantford factory and were beginning to show up at local farmer-owned co-operatives all across the Midwest of the United States. The Canadian Co-operative Implements Limited (CCIL) also marketed the Co-op E3, E4, and E5 in Canada.|$|R
