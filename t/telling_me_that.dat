500|$|In September 2000, Herndon {{reunited with}} McBride and Thomas after meeting {{them at a}} party at the Handlebar-J Restaurant & Bar in Scottsdale, Arizona, to {{celebrate}} the club's 25th anniversary. After they performed [...] "No More Cryin'" [...] there, Herndon suggested that they officially reunite as McBride & the Ride, saying [...] "This thing in my gut was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was the right time for this." [...] The trio recorded demo tapes and began searching for a record deal, signing to the independent Dualtone Records in 2002. Working with pianist and record producer Matt Rollings, McBride & the Ride recorded its only album for Dualtone, titled Amarillo Sky, and released it in September of that year. Unlike previous albums, the band wrote most of the songs and played most of the instruments itself because, according to Thomas, [...] "Terry thought this would be even more of a band-like situation if we wrote together more. It would bring us even tighter as a unit." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1940s, Hart had sunk into {{alcoholism}} and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and [...] prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein {{to ask if}} he would consider working with him. [...] Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was Oklahoma! (1943). [...] Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is [...] "the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. [...] In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma! and what came after it." [...] An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would serve, according to Hischak, as [...] "the model for Broadway shows for decades", and proved a huge popular and financial success. [...] Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. [...] Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers [...] "was Sam's blunt but funny way of <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma!" [...] As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, [...] "We're such fools. [...] No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another Oklahoma! [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, a feud arose {{between the}} {{producer}} and R singer Ginuwine, after Timbaland {{failed to make}} an appearance at the singer's music video shoot of [...] "Get Involved". Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled [...] "Talk That". In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold {{claim to be the}} inspiration for the dub-step music scene. [...] "The UK scene... they’re always <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I started it. You have Dub-bass...". When questioned further about it he went on to say: [...] "It’s funny cos they went back to some of my old music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass." [...] In August 2010, a [...] "possible suicide attempt" [...] APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted.|$|E
500|$|Crace {{was pleased}} with public {{reaction}} to the mother-daughter storyline, commenting prior to the reveal: [...] "Everyone seems desperate to know why Danielle hasn't told Ronnie yet, so I'm taking that as a sign they're enjoying the story. Viewers are always <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they love it when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they're {{on the edge of}} their seats, waiting to see when Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity." [...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." [...] Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the [...] "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9p.m. watershed.|$|E
2500|$|Mueller's {{optimism}} grew in 1968 and he chided Wernher von Braun (who {{had been}} cautiously promoting a cheap interim shuttle-type craft), [...] "You'd be <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my Shuttle {{was in the}} future and you needed an interim system." [...] Mueller was sure that the incoming president, Richard Nixon, would want to go [...] "all out" [...] and that [...] "this may be the big program for Nixon".|$|E

2500|$|Later in the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama cited his {{crafting}} of {{this speech}} {{as an example}} of a [...] "gut decision". Speaking to journalist Joe Klein in October 2008, Obama said that he decided to make his response to Rev. Wright's comments [...] "big as opposed to make it small", and added: [...] "My gut was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was a teachable moment and that if I tried to do the usual political damage control instead of talking to the American people like ... they were adults and could understand the complexities of race, I would be not only doing damage to the campaign but missing an important opportunity for leadership." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are you <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E
2500|$|On August 4, 2017, Márquez {{announced}} his retirement from professional boxing after a 21 year career. Márquez spoke to ESPN Deportes TV show Golpe a Golpe, [...] "Today is a special and sad day for me because I'm announcing my retirement. The injuries pushed me to make this decision. It hurts, but I believe {{the right moment to}} put an end to my career has arrived. I would have loved to do a final fight to say goodbye inside the ring, but I have to listen to my body, and it was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the right moment to stop boxing is now." [...] He ended his career with a record of record of 56 wins, 7 losses and 1 draw, with 40 knockouts. Márquez admitted the decision was hard to make, but initially made the decision 10 days prior to announcing it.|$|E

2500|$|Twilight's director, Catherine Hardwicke, said of {{the casting}} process that [...] "verybody has such an {{idealized}} vision of Edward. They were rabid [...] Like, old ladies saying, 'You better get it right." [...] She revealed that she was initially underwhelmed by a photo of Pattinson, but said of his audition, which was a love scene with co-star Kristen Stewart: [...] "It was electric. The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This {{is going to be}} good.'" [...] Pattinson has admitted; [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} play the part when I went in, and it was a good thing to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really even know what it was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ It was pretty much because of Kristen." [...] In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I stopped reading [...] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'" [...] He revealed to the Evening Standard that; [...] "The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory. I hope I can prove them wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Buffalo Chips was {{standing}} opposite me. [...] He {{was one of}} those long-haired scouts, and claimed to be a partner of Buffalo Bill’s. [...] He {{thought it was a good}} place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he was going to have one of the Indians’ scalps. [...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a [...] "good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill’s Don Quixote." [...] Gen. [...] Charles King said he was a good man.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
