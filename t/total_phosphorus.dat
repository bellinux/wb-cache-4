25|$|North American beaver (Castor canadensis) were re-introduced to the Tahoe Basin by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service between 1934 and 1949. Descended from no {{more than}} nine individuals, 1987 beaver populations on {{the upper and lower}} Truckee River had reached a density of 0.72 colonies (3.5 beavers) per kilometer. At the present time beaver have been seen in Tahoe Keys, Taylor Creek, Meeks Creek at Meeks Bay on the western shore, and Kings Beach on the north shore, so the {{descendants}} of the original nine beavers have apparently migrated around most of Lake Tahoe. Recently novel physical evidence has demonstrated that beaver were native to the Sierra until at least the mid-nineteenth century, via radiocarbon dating of buried beaver dam wood uncovered by deep channel incision in the Feather River watershed. That report was supported by a summary of indirect evidence of beaver including reliable observer accounts of beaver in multiple watersheds from the northern to the southern Sierra Nevada, including its eastern slope. A specific documented record of beaver living historically in Lake Tahoe's North Canyon Creek watershed above Glenbrook includes a description of Spooner Meadow rancher Charles Fulstone hiring a caretaker to control the beaver population in the early 20th century. A recent study of Taylor Creek showed that beaver dam removal decreased wetland habitat, increased stream flow, and increased <b>total</b> <b>phosphorus</b> pollutants entering Lake Tahoe – all factors which negatively impact the clarity of the lake's water. In addition, beaver dams located in Ward Creek, located on the west shore of Lake Tahoe, were also shown to decrease nutrients and sediments traveling downstream.|$|E

However, during this 23-year period, three events contributed to a worsening of water quality within a given year. The first coincided with a storm in March 1993.

The study assesses the amounts of phosphorus in different forms in surface horizon of Gleysols and Histosols used as meadow and pastures. Soil samples were collected from eight profiles situated {{in the eastern part}} of Wielkopolska in the Kujawskie Lake region, central Poland. Phosphorus forms were sequentially extracted by Hedley et al. (1982) procedure modified by Ajiboye et al. (2004). Moreover, total and available contents of phosphorus were determined. On the basis of the obtained results it was stated that the content of both <b>total</b> and available <b>phosphorus</b> was comparable for Gleysols and Histosols and on average amounted from 0. 885 to 0. 908 g·kg- 1 for <b>phosphorus</b> <b>total</b> and from 0. 220 to 0. 276 g·kg- 1 for the available form.

40|$|Application of a {{modified}} UV-irradiation procedure to the fractionation of <b>total</b> dissolved <b>phosphorus</b> (TDP) in seawater was examined. By using a peristaltic pump, a sample solution was {{passed through a}} quartz column which was coiled around the three Hg-lamps and thus consistently exposed to a controlled UV-irradiation flux. The UV-flux was much lower than that historically employed to hydrolyze <b>total</b> dissolved organic <b>phosphorus</b> (DOP). Before and after the UV-irradiation, colorimetric measurements of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) {{were made by the}} method of Murphy and Riley (1962) to determine the liberation rate of orthophosphate from P-compounds in the sample. Experiments using 19 different P-compounds indicated that organic phosphate-esters containing only monomers of phosphate were readily decomposed by a 20 -minute UV-irradiation period. Release of SRP from organic polyphosphates was minimal. The P released by this procedure is operationally referred to as “UV-P”. The procedure described herein was employed for fractionation of TDP in seawater. These studies defined several classes of dissolved P: (1) PO 4 –P (inorganic phosphate-P), (2) UV-P (Photo-decomposable organic-P, most of which consists of organic monophosphate-P), and (3) Org-Poly-P (organic polyphosphate-P).
