40|$|In {{this article}} I address <b>the</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>of</b> Universals by {{answering}} questions about what facts a solution to <b>the</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>of</b> Universals should explain and how the explanation should go. I argue that a solution to <b>the</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>of</b> Universals explains <b>the</b> facts <b>the</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>of</b> Universals is about by giving the truthmakers (as opposed to the conceptual content and the ontological commitments) of the sentences stating those facts. I argue that the sentences stating the relevant facts are those like 'a has the property F', that is, sentences stating that a particular has a certain property. Finally I show how answering these questions in this way transforms <b>the</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>of</b> Universals, traditionally conceived as the One over Many, that is, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> explaining how different particulars can have the same properties, into the Many over One, that is, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> explaining how <b>the</b> same particular can have different properties. <b>The</b> <b>Problem</b> <b>of</b> Universals is <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Many over One. © Oxford University Press 2000...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a series <b>of</b> papers {{studying}} <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> existence of double categories for which horizontal bicategory and object category are given.

We establish a formal framework within which <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> existence of internalizations can be correctly formulated. Further, we introduce the condition of a double category being globularily generated. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> existence of internalizations for a decorated bicategory admits a solution if and only if it admits a globularily generated solution, and we prove that the condition of a double category being globularily generated is precisely the condition of a solution to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> existence of internalizations for a decorated bicategory being minimal. The study of the condition of a double category being globularily generated will thus be pivotal in our study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> existence of internalizations.
