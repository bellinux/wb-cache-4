5|$|Jerome {{reports that}} {{apparently}} the Christians {{had intended to}} remove Joseph's bones to their city, but a column of fire rose skyward from the tomb scaring <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> The Samaritans subsequently covered the tomb with earth rendering it inaccessible.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry <b>them</b> <b>away</b> to their burrows {{to feed on}} the egg's capitulum, while leaving {{the rest of the}} egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood.|$|E
5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping <b>them</b> <b>away</b> for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take <b>them</b> <b>away</b> from the men would probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Braun {{was very}} fond of Negus and Stasi, her two Scottish Terrier dogs, and they appear in her home movies. She usually kept <b>them</b> <b>away</b> from Hitler's German Shepherd, Blondi. Blondi was killed {{by one of the}} entourage on 29 April 1945 when Hitler ordered that one of the cyanide {{capsules}} obtained for Braun and Hitler's suicide the next day be tested on the dog. Braun's dogs and Blondi's puppies were shot on 30 April by Hitler's dog handler, Fritz Tornow.|$|E

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift <b>them</b> <b>away</b> from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, after {{dozens of}} people {{reported}} seeing a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award for proof of its existence. In February 2012, work on two reservoirs near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded <b>them</b> <b>away</b> from the sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, {{three young}} boys {{turned up at}} a senior {{athletics}} meet in Geelong, Victoria. They approached official Trevor Billingham, but Billingham turned <b>them</b> <b>away</b> citing their youth {{as a reason for}} them not to be allowed to compete. A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance.|$|E

5|$|In the game, Mario {{is portrayed}} as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his younger brother Luigi, has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers below New York City. The {{gameplay}} focuses on Mario's extermination of them by flipping them on their backs and kicking <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> The original versions of Mario Bros.—the arcade version and the Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System (FC/NES) version—were received positively by critics.|$|E
5|$|Kaldalis is a protoss zealot and a {{close friend}} of Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis takes pride {{in the history of the}} protoss and the Khala, though does not express {{prejudice}} towards the Nerazim, and believes that driving <b>them</b> <b>away</b> was a sin. A scar runs down his left eye. Kaldalis survived the zerg conquest of Aiur during the Great War. Afterwards, he joined the Protoss Protectorate led by Hierarch Artanis. Kaldalis was impressed by Artanis' vision of a unified protoss society, the Daelaam: incorporating the cultures of Khalai, Nerazim, Tal'Darim and Purifiers.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{agrees to}} {{accompany}} Dillon on an {{investigation and the}} pair visit the farmer, who refuses to talk and sends <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> At a pub, they {{find out that the}} nearby village of Winnerden Flats has been leveled to build an enormous industrial plant protected by armed guards, which is identical to Quatermass' moonbase design. Upon investigating a newly fallen meteorite, Dillon is sprayed from it with ammonia gas, and a distinctive mark appears on his face.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw <b>them</b> <b>away,</b> decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave <b>them</b> <b>away</b> to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, Rasminah is {{awakened by}} the sound of a guitar, played by the house's owner, Hoesin (Djoemala). Afraid that he is collaborating with her pursuer, she sneaks outside, only to be confronted by Parta and Doel. Retreating, she is chased by the pair. Hoesin intervenes and, after a fierce fight, defeats the two and chases <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> He then reassures Rasminah and escorts her home.|$|E

5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted <b>them</b> <b>away.</b> After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed <b>them</b> <b>away</b> without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored <b>them</b> <b>away</b> in rolls of 50.|$|E
