5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, experimenting with Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected {{to play for the}} Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|The Expédition d'Irlande ("Expedition to Ireland") was an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt by the}} First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars to assist the outlawed Society of United Irishmen, a popular rebel Irish republican group, in their planned rebellion against British rule. The French intended to land a large expeditionary force in Ireland {{during the winter of}} 1796–1797 which would join with the United Irishmen and drive the British out of Ireland. The French anticipated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major blow to British morale, prestige and military effectiveness, and was also intended to possibly be the first stage of an eventual invasion of Britain itself. To this end, the French Directory gathered a force of approximately 15,000 soldiers at Brest under General Lazare Hoche during late 1796, in readiness for a major landing at Bantry Bay in December.|$|E

25|$|While {{still at}} school, Tatchell campaigned {{in favour of}} better {{treatment}} of, and full human rights for, the Aboriginal people of Australia. He believes that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names, to sever ties with the colonial era. For example, he wants the Tasmanian capital Hobart to be renamed Nibberluna, arguing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fitting tribute to Australia's Aboriginal heritage, which he says has been discarded and disrespected for too long.|$|E
25|$|If in a {{community}} or neighborhood composed principally of whites, a citizen of African descent, or of the Indian race, not within {{the exception of the}} Amendment, should propose to lease and cultivate a farm, and a combination should be formed to expel him and prevent him from the accomplishment of his purpose on account of his race or color, it cannot be doubted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> case within in power of Congress to remedy and redress.|$|E

25|$|On 20 November 2010, Sergio got {{a chance}} to avenge his loss to Williams. Both fighters were ranked among the top six pound-for-pound fighters, and Williams came into the fight as the Ring No. 2 ranked Middleweight. Many speculated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fight of the year candidate. Approximately one minute into the second round, Martínez knocked Williams out with an {{over-the-top}} left hand to retain his title. The knockout was called by many as the knockout of the year.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its earlier}} involvement, the Discovery Institute was {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> test case {{and that the}} defendants had earlier displayed their religious motivations. This tension led to disagreements with the Thomas More Law Center and the withdrawal of three Discovery Institute fellows as defense experts prior to their depositions– William A. Dembski, Stephen C. Meyer and John Angus Campbell. This was purportedly because the Thomas More Law Center refused to allow these witnesses {{to have their own}} attorneys present during deposition, but Discovery Institute director Bruce Chapman later said that he had asked them not to testify (as well as Behe and Minnich, who testified anyway).|$|E
25|$|If it were {{possible}} for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages {{at the expense of}} profits.|$|E

25|$|At Cabinet on 15 June, Reynaud {{urged the}} Cabinet {{to adopt the}} Dutch example, that the Army should lay down its arms so that the fight could be {{continued}} from abroad; Pétain was sympathetic. Pétain was sent to speak to General Weygand (who was waiting outside, as {{he was not a}} member of the Cabinet). Weygand persuaded him <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shameful surrender. Chautemps then suggested a fudge proposal, an inquiry about terms. The Cabinet voted 13-6 for the Chautemps proposal. Reynaud tried to resign on the spot but Lebrun shouted at him. Admiral Darlan, who had been opposed to an armistice until 15 June, now agreed, provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands. On 15 June, Reynaud threw two glasses of water over de Portes at dinner; a key telegram had been found in her bed after it went missing.|$|E
25|$|Útgarða-Loki {{says that}} no {{visitors}} {{are allowed to}} stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing {{in the rear of}} the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. Útgarða-Loki comments <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, Þjálfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.|$|E
500|$|Danton’s {{criticism}} of the Terror won him some support, but a financial scandal involving the French East India Company provided a [...] "convenient pretext" [...] for his downfall. Robespierre again sent Saint-Just to the Convention to deliver a Committee [...] "report" [...] (31 March 1794) in which he announced the arrest of Danton and [...] "the last partisans of royalism". In addition to charges of corruption related to the trading company, Saint-Just accused Danton of conspiring to restore the monarchy, and he denounced him as a [...] "bad citizen", a [...] "false friend", and a [...] "wicked man". After a tumultuous show-trial, Fabre, Desmoulins, and other top supporters of Danton went to the scaffold with their leader on 16 Germinal (5 April 1794). In his report, Saint-Just had promised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "final cleansing" [...] of the Republic's enemies.|$|E

500|$|The two-hour premiere episode {{cost up to}} $10 {{million to}} produce, and Cameron {{reportedly}} [...] "brought the pilot in on time and on budget". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and guerilla marketing. Cameron took a [...] "very basic view" [...] of the show's chance of success, saying: [...] "If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve to be off the air. It's that simple." [...] Eglee admitted the series had been [...] "routinely overbudget" [...] in the first season, and feared <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor in {{whether or not the}} show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.|$|E
500|$|The Finance Bill {{passed the}} Commons on 5 November 1909 but was {{rejected}} by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge and had forbidden his adviser Lord Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass. In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered [...] "outrageous" [...] by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.|$|E
500|$|Smith had [...] "an intimacy" [...] {{with the}} level design tools such that he could sense when the design met the game's {{technical}} restrictions, like the maximum possible size or number of characters for a room. He suggested the narrower skill tree with palpable effects, such as exchanging skills about weapon damage for more accessible weapons. The team adopted the cuts, having been encouraged by the recent milestone. Spector has said that had {{they waited for the}} beta to have made the same reductions (as per common practice), [...] "it would have been a disaster." [...] Spector's post-proto-mission strategy was to bring the rest of the missions to proto-mission functionality rather than perfecting the two existing proto-missions. He felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more efficient use of staff time, even if it meant that the final product would be more [...] "bare-bones" [...] than brilliant. Almost all of their game systems besides the inventory and conversation schemes were rethought up {{through the end of the}} project.|$|E

500|$|Veteran African-American {{civil rights}} activist Bayard Rustin was King's first regular advisor on nonviolence. King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley. Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Gandhi's teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation {{campaign}} in the 1940s, and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s. King had initially known little about Gandhi and rarely used the term [...] "nonviolence" [...] during his early years of activism in the early 1950s. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns in his household {{as a means of}} defense against possible attackers. The pacifists guided King by showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better means to accomplish his goals of civil rights than self-defense. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.|$|E
500|$|The {{starship}} [...] {{encounters a}} rift in spacetime {{while on a}} routine mission. As they monitor the anomaly, the heavily damaged USS Enterprise-C, a ship {{believed to have been}} destroyed more than two decades earlier, emerges. Instantly, the Enterprise-D undergoes a sudden and radical change from its current timeline: it is now a warship, and the United Federation of Planets is at war with the Klingons. Neither Worf nor Counselor Troi are seen or referred to, and Tasha Yar– who was killed years before– is now running the tactical station. None of the crew notice the change, but [...] senses that reality has shifted, and has a meeting with Captain Picard to discuss her concerns. She senses that there are supposed to be children on the ship, which of course is completely impractical on a warship. She suggests that the Enterprise-C does not belong in their time and must return to the past. Picard, who knows <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suicide mission, refuses to give such an order on Guinan's intuition alone.|$|E
500|$|New to acting, the {{children}} often made errors such as {{staring into the}} camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously {{in an attempt to}} [...] "bore the hell out of [...] ", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally. A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and {{the children}}'s responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3–4days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were [...] "jaded". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions. The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was [...] deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.|$|E
