5|$|On July 5, 2013, {{after his}} {{contract}} had expired with the Maple Leafs, MacArthur signed a two-year, $6.5 million deal with Toronto's Ontario rivals, the Ottawa Senators. On August 19, 2014, the Senators announced <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> signed MacArthur to {{a five-year contract}} extension worth a total of $23.25 million—carrying a $4.65 million annual average value—set to start in the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E

5|$|Prior to forming Taxiride, Tim Watson, Tim Wild, Jason Singh, and Dan Hall {{had each}} played in cover bands across Melbourne. Watson and Wild began writing {{together}} in 1997 in Camberwell, Melbourne, and soon recruited Singh {{as an additional}} vocalist. The trio invited Hall, whom Wild first encountered busking, to join the group, and he accepted. The band named themselves Taxiride because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> some of their early work {{to a friend of}} theirs, a taxi driver, who had tested these songs on passengers. The group produced a demo at Melbourne's Secret Sound Studios, and used it to land a contract with Warner in Australia. Meanwhile, a friend of the group passed their work onto a Sire Records executive in the U.S., who signed them despite the group being unknown.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the left wing, and Dodge and the regulars the center element. As the Native Americans retreated toward the river, the militia's left wing were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat and hope that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling point about midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E

25|$|Grobbelaar was {{retained}} by three of Liverpool's greatest managers; Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish, {{over a period}} of 13 years.

The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions. In January 2015, Melissa Benoist was cast as the character. It debuted on October 26, 2015.

The Gymnosophists were Hindus, but Jain and Ajivika monks practiced nudity as {{a statement that}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>given</b> up all worldly goods.
