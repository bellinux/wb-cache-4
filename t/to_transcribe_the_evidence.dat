5000|$|The British {{had a long}} {{tradition}} prior to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 of executing sepoys found guilty of mutiny or desertion in this manner. According to one historian, the British tradition began in 1760, when the government examined the modes of capital punishment in use. In the district of the 24 Perganas, {{it was found that}} the common military mode of capital punishment was flogging to death. Regarding blowing from a gun as an old Mughal punishment, the government opted for this technique, as being, relative to death by flogging, more deterrent, more public and more humane. Already in 1761, orders were given in Lakhipur [...] "to fire off at the mouth of a cannon the leader of the thieves who was made prisoner, that others may be deterred". Technically, in cases of court-martial, it seems that until 1857 the courts were composed of native officers rather than British, but it is added: [...] "although they are presided over, and generally led and ruled, by the superintending officer, whose duty, however, is merely <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> and assist the native officers with advice and counsel".|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of transcriptions are written {{documents}} and {{video and audio}} records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes <b>the</b> available <b>evidence.</b> If a transcription is wrong, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> is altered. If there is failure <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> <b>the</b> full text, <b>evidence</b> is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being <b>the</b> <b>evidence.</b> A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations {{that are difficult to}} comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily. Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.|$|R
