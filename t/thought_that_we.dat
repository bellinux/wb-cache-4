5|$|Freedom for the <b>Thought</b> <b>That</b> <b>We</b> Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the <b>Thought</b> <b>That</b> <b>We</b> Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the <b>Thought</b> <b>That</b> <b>We</b> Hate {{discusses}} the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E

5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate Speech, in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate Speech and discussed Freedom for the <b>Thought</b> <b>That</b> <b>We</b> Hate, in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, The Harm in Hate Speech persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E
25|$|Many {{commentators}} have since rejected {{this understanding of}} Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in {{the idea that it}} is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... 6. If {{we would}} live in peace, let us {{remember}} our relations to God--as children to a father, and {{to each other as}} brethren. Will not the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have one Father quiet us, and the <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are brethren unite us? It was this that made Abraham propose terms of peace to Lot (Gen 13): 'Let there be no strife,' saith he, 'between us, for we are brethren.' And we read of Moses, in Acts 7:26, using this argument to reconcile those that strove together, and to set them at one again: 'Sirs,' saith he, 'ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?' A deep sense of this relation, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are brethren, would keep us from dividing.|$|R

500|$|Freedom for the <b>Thought</b> <b>That</b> <b>We</b> Hate {{analyzes}} {{the value of}} freedom of speech and presents an overview of the historical development of rights afforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Its title derives from Justice Holmes' admonition, in his dissenting opinion in United States v. Schwimmer (1929), that the First Amendment's guarantees are most worthy of protection in times of fear and upheaval, when calls for suppression of dissent are most strident and superficially appealing. Holmes wrote that [...] "if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hate." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the book is drawn from the dissenting opinion by Supreme Court Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in United States v. Schwimmer. Holmes wrote that [...] "if there is any {{principle}} of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hate." [...] Lewis warns the reader against the potential for government to take advantage of periods of fear and upheaval in a post-9/11 society to suppress freedom of speech and criticism by citizens.|$|E
500|$|Anders Jakobson, their drummer, {{reported}} that [...] "It was {{all these different}} types of people who enjoyed what we were doing. [...] We made grindcore a bit easier to listen to {{at the expense of}} the diehard grindcore fans who <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were, well, not sellouts, but not really true to the original essence of grindcore." [...] Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted [...] "had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres".|$|E

60|$|It must be so. All <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> peer {{outside this}} narrow world cannot be else than dim and shapeless. The <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can clearly grasp are very little thoughts--that {{two and two}} make four-that when we are hungry it is {{pleasant}} to eat--that honesty is the best policy; all greater thoughts are undefined and vast to our poor childish brains. We see but dimly through the mists that roll around our time-girt isle of life, and only hear the distant surging of the great sea beyond.|$|R
500|$|In 1971, a live version {{recorded}} on 30 March 1968 in New York City with Page on guitar was included on [...] Relf announced the song saying [...] "Most people <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could never, ever recreate the solo part on stage; well {{we have a}} very good try at least—Jimmy 'Magic Fingers, Grand Sorcerer of the Magic Guitar'". Live versions have appeared on various semi-official and bootleg albums over the years. [...] Seven are included on the 2010 rarities collection Glimpses 1963–1968, including one recorded a week after Page joined to play bass. [...] A studio recording by the reconstituted Yardbirds in 2003, with guitar by Steve Vai, is included on Birdland.|$|E
500|$|Freedom for the <b>Thought</b> <b>That</b> <b>We</b> Hate {{was first}} {{published}} by Basic Books, {{a member of the}} Perseus Books Group, in New York in 2007, with the subtitle, A Biography of the First Amendment. For just the second printing, in both New York and London in 2008, the book's subtitle was simplified to Tales of the First Amendment. [...] That change was reverted for the remaining printings, including the paperback edition in 2009 and a large print edition in 2010. [...] E-book versions were released for the first, third and fourth printings; an audiobook was released with the second printing, and re-released with the fourth. The book has also been translated into Chinese, and was published in Beijing in 2010.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Stormer {{capitalized}} on {{the popularity of}} the augmented reality video game Pokémon Go in mid-2016 to distribute racist flyers to children congregating in public to play the game, with Anglin explaining that [...] "I have long <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to get pre-teens involved in the movement. At that age, you can really brainwash someone easily. Anyone who accepts Nazism at the age of 10 or 11 {{is going to be a}} Nazi for life." [...] On May 3, 2017, one day after a deadly stabbing attack at the University of Texas, racist flyers were posted across campus with the website address for The Daily Stormer, a caricature of a black person, and the line [...] "...around blacks... never relax!".|$|E
60|$|We did {{not expect}} to make the journey without some danger of coming across small parties of the painted brutes who thirsted for the blood of white people; but it was not in our <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should {{encounter}} any serious dangers. The worst of the tramp, so we believed, might be the labor of pushing on through the underbrush until the many miles which lay between us and Corn Island had been traversed.|$|R

500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} in five weeks, and the recording and mixing lasted three weeks. As the game's music budget was low, a small Los Angeles orchestra {{was used to}} record the music; {{the sound of the}} each instrument was doubled during production. Inon Zur described the music as having [...] "some uniqueness to it, that basically it developed throughout the game [...] the [...] of more instruments, taking flutes and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra." [...] Zur later said, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> definitely met some high standards; we compared our products to big budget films scores," [...] and, [...] "in the end we were quite happy." [...] The game features voice work from Gabrielle Carteris, Peter Stormare, and Grey DeLisle, among others.|$|E
500|$|December 1967 {{also saw}} the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (UK No. 3; US No. 2), which {{received}} unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> weren't concentrating {{and that we were}} being childish. It was not a great moment really – and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, Marquee Moon was a post-punk album, while Jason Heller from The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "elegantly jagged" [...] art punk. Robert Christgau regarded it {{as more of a}} rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: [...] "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." [...] Both sides of the album began with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazines Evan Chakroff said veered between progressive rock and post-punk styles. The title track and [...] "Torn Curtain" [...] were longer and more jam-oriented. [...] "As peculiar as it sounds, I've always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were a pop band", Verlaine later told Select. [...] "You know, I always thought Marquee Moon was a bunch of cool singles. And then I'd realise, Christ, [...] is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{celebrate}} Margaret E. Montoya’s Máscaras, Trenzas, y Greñas as a canonical {{article in}} critical race theory because its deft interweaving and unbraiding of stories helps us consider the marginalizing {{assumptions of the}} legal world, the way normativity translates into authority, and {{the means by which}} the mainstream is disguised as unbiased.

500|$|Tynan {{remarked to}} Olivier, [...] "you aren't really a contemplative or {{philosophical}} actor"; Olivier {{was known for}} the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this {{was because he was}} influenced as a young man by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: [...] "tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did.... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan." [...] According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered [...] "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." [...] Olivier described the contrast thus: [...] "I've always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Alonso Ruizpalacios, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, gathering 300 fans who responded to an invitation posted by Lafourcade in social networks. The singer asked her fans to send a thought inspired by the song or a personal story derived from their identification with [...] "Hasta la Raíz". [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would get few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later {{it turned into a}} riot and we did not know if they would get out of control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool," [...] Lafourcade told Variety Latino. In the video, shot in black and white, Lafourcade is surrounded by several people who lead her to a stage to perform {{the last part of the}} song, in the meantime, Lafourcade throws flowers in the air, kisses a guy and plays a guitar. According to Milly Contreras of Latin Post the video [...] "shows off the singer's individuality and simplicity" [...] and included it at number 7 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} New Line was {{rebooting}} the Nightmare on Elm Street film series, Emmerich explained, [...] "The Nightmare films are profoundly disturbing on a deep, human level because they're about our dreams. It's why we <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could reach an especially broad audience {{with a new}} film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture." [...] Overall, Bayer {{wanted to create a}} darker Nightmare on Elm Street, one he felt would fit into what he describes as [...] "a darker world". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, [...] "What makes a monster?" [...] Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove? ...|$|E
