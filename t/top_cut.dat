5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the <b>Top</b> <b>Cut</b> since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the Weller Curve project {{cleared the way for}} work on the <b>Top</b> <b>Cut,</b> the [...] stretch just below the summit on the western side, which {{includes}} the most seriously eroded slopes anywhere in the pass corridor. Lewis had always intended to focus the IPF's efforts on it, and the organization began the first of several ongoing projects there in 1996. Work included the construction of stone retaining walls as well as revegetation. By the 2010s the results were evident.|$|E

The race {{has been held}} almost every year since on the weekend before CDOT opens the pass. It follows a [...] course from the gate to Independence. Two {{years after the first}} one the IPF began the project Lewis had always envisioned for it—restoring the <b>Top</b> <b>Cut,</b> the [...] section just below the pass on the east, where the {{environmental}} damage, especially erosion, had always been most evident.|$|E

No structure loss {{was observed in}} {{the bodies of the}} ingots. The performance of solar cells made from the 100 % recycled Si ingot decreases towards the seed end of the ingot, which could be related to a non-optimal pulling process. Solar cells from the tail end of this ingot and from the 50 % recycled Si ingot demonstrated an average solar cell efficiency of 18. 6 %. This is only 0. 1 % absolute lower than the efficiency of higher resistivity reference solar cells from commercially available wafers that were co-processed...|$|R
2500|$|The bendré drum (called bara in Mali and dumaa {{among the}} Hausa) is a membranophone {{made from a}} gourd with the <b>top</b> <b>cut</b> off and covered with goat or sheep skin. It is an ancient instrument, [...] {{probably}} introduced {{during the reign of}} Naaba Oubri to be played in sacred music at the royal courts of Moaga by a head drummer (benaaba) who strikes the center or edges of the drum to make varying sounds.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{different}} types of scouts, some enlisted as Indian Scouts for brief terms and there were others who were hired as scouts by the U.S. Army. Some individual may have served at different times as a hired scout and an enlisted scout. Prior to the act in 1866 these scouts were considered employees rather than soldiers. Enlistment records and muster rolls, from 1866 to 1912 were in many instances filed by state, some records were broken down by company or military post providing information such as when, where, and by whom the scout was enlisted; period of enlistment; place of birth; age at time of enlistment; physical description; and possibly additional remarks such as discharge information, including date and place of discharge, rank at the time, and if the scout died in service. Indian scouts who were officially enlisted in the army after 1866 were issued old pattern uniforms from surplus stock legally exempt from sale. [...] Their uniforms were worn with less regulation, sometimes mixed with their native dress. In 1870, Captain Bourke of the 3rd cavalry described Apache scouts in Arizona as “almost naked, their only clothing being a muslin loin-cloth, a pair of point toed moccasins and a hat of hawk feather”. In 1876 a description of Crow Scouts reads that they wore, [...] “an old black army hat with <b>top</b> <b>cut</b> out and sides bound round with feathers, fur and scarlet cloth”. [...] With the availability of army clothing some Native scouts {{took advantage of the}} availability of the clothing. In 1902 when new regulations were introduced in March the U.S. Scouts received a new more regulated uniform.|$|E

When they sank, a dark mass with a ragged <b>top</b> <b>cut</b> off the view from the pilot-house, and Kit knew it was a mangrove forest. He could see no break in the wall of trees that grew out of the water, but they were not far off when there was a heavy jar, and the Rio Negro stopped. The floor of the pilot-house slanted and Kit and the quartermaster fell against the wheel. Then there was a roar as a white-topped roller came up astern and broke about the vessel's rail in boiling foam. She lifted, struck again, and went on with an awkward lurch.|$|E
6000|$|But {{now what}} manner of creatures are these which form these hard skeletons? I dare {{say that in}} these days of keeping aquaria, of {{locomotion}} to the sea-side, most of those whom I am addressing may have seen one of those creatures which used {{to be known as the}} [...] "sea anemone," [...] receiving that name on account of its general resemblance, in a rough sort of way, to the flower which is known as the [...] "anemone"; but being a thing which lives in the sea, it was qualified as the [...] "sea anemone." [...] Well, then, you must suppose a body shaped like a short cylinder, the <b>top</b> <b>cut</b> off, and in the top a hole rather oval than round. All round this aperture, which is the mouth, imagine that there are placed a number of feelers forming a circle. The cavity of the mouth leads into a sort of stomach, which is very unlike those of the higher animals, in the circumstance that it opens at the lower end into a cavity of the body, and all the digested matter, converted into nourishment, is thus distributed through the rest of the body. That is the general structure of one of these sea anemones. If you touch it it contracts immediately into a heap. It looks at first quite like a flower in the sea, but if you touch it you find that it exhibits all the peculiarities of a living animal; and if anything which can serve as its prey comes near its tentacles, it closes them round it and sucks the material into its stomach and there digests it and turns it to the account of its own body.|$|E
