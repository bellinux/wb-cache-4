25|$|When the {{infection}} occurs {{in an early}} stage of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plant</b> there may be wilting on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The wilting may only show {{on one side of the}} leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. Wilting may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of dry olive mill residue (DOR), as affected by saprobic fungi on the growth of soybean (Glycine max) and <b>tomato</b> (Lycopersicum esculentum). <b>The</b> application of 60 g kg − 1 of DOR decreased the dry weight of <b>tomato</b> and soybean <b>plants</b> mainly because of its phenolic content. The phytotoxicity of DOR decreased when it was incubated {{in the presence of}} almost all of the saprobic fungi tested.

However, the toxicity of these residues to either <b>tomato</b> or soybean <b>plants</b> did not decrease in the presence of all saprobic fungi in spite of a decrease in phenolic compounds. Some of the saprobic fungi tested eliminate completely the phytotoxicity of DOR. F. oxysporum 738 and F. lateritum were capable of transforming the DOR, after incubation for 20 weeks, so that <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> to which this transformed DOR was applied increased significantly in shoot dry weight compared with <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> which did not receive DOR.

40|$|The {{pollination}} {{effectiveness of}} the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata and the honey bee Apis mellifera was tested in <b>tomato</b> plots. <b>The</b> experiment was conducted in four greenhouses {{as well as in}} an external open plot in Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. <b>The</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> were exposed to visits by M. quadrifasciata in one greenhouse and to A. mellifera in another; two greenhouses were maintained without bees (controls) and an open field plot was exposed to pollinators in an area where both honey bee and stingless bee colonies are abundant. We counted <b>the</b> number of <b>tomatoes</b> produced in each plot. Two hundred tomatoes from each plot were weighed, their vertical and transversal circumferences were measured, and the seeds were counted. We collected 253 Chrysomelidae, 17 Halictidae, one Paratrigona sp, and one honey bee from the flowers of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> in <b>the</b> open area. The largest number of fruits (1414 <b>tomatoes),</b> <b>the</b> heaviest and largest <b>tomatoes,</b> and <b>the</b> ones with the most seed were collected from the greenhouse with stingless bees.

50|$|The fungus can {{be found}} in soil in grassland, shrubland, plantations, sheep and cattle yards, and domesticated and non-domesticated animal feces. It colonizes forest steppe soil, mixed forest soil, and Mediterranean brown soil (pH 6.9-8.0) where the pH can be as low as 4.5, but is {{typically}} above 5.5. The fungus has also been found in aquatic environments, and heavily polluted areas, specifically heavy metal poisoned mines, fungicide, or nematicide infested soil, decayed plant material, leaves, roots, moss, and in the rhizosphere of various bean plants, barley, and <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plant.</b> Larger populations of the fungus {{can be found}} in late spring and summer.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{control is}} the use of other crops as a source of trap crops. Squashes can act as trap crops for the silverleaf whitefly due to the flies’ attraction to these crops. Silverleaf whiteflies are actually more attracted to the squash crop than they are to <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plant.</b> When squash serves as a trap crop, the tomato yellow curl leaf virus can be controlled and limited. Scientific experiments show in the fields that growing squash crops around the areas where tomato plants can be found is a useful manipulation in regulating the silverleaf whitefly population as well as the transmission of TYLCV. Other plants that can serve as trap crops include cantaloupe and cucumber.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tomato {{is one of}} the {{economically}} important crops in Bulgaria. Low <b>tomato</b> yields in <b>the</b> country are mostly due to lack of knowledge on sustainable agronomic practices, lack of improved varieties, which are well suited for high yield and resistance to diseases, and also due to damage caused by pests and diseases. Many viruses infect <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> crop. <b>The</b> object of this research was to identify viruses infecting tomato crops in Bulgaria. The presence or absence of a viral infection in <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> was carried out with DAS-ELISA serologic assays with specific polyclonal immunoglobulin G for the relevant plant virus. Most of <b>the</b> <b>tomato</b> <b>plants</b> were infected with one or two viruses and in rare cases with more than two viruses.
