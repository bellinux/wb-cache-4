5|$|Computer {{role-playing}} games (CRPGs) {{are once}} again popular. Recent titles, such as BioWare's Mass Effect series and Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls series, have been produced for console systems and have received multi-platform releases, although independently developed games are frequently created as personal computer (PC) exclusives. Developers of role-playing games have continuously experimented with various graphical perspectives and styles of play, such as real-time and turn-based <b>time-keeping</b> systems, axonometric and first-person graphical projections, and single-character or multi-character parties. Subgenres include action role-playing games, roguelikes and tactical role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Mount Stromlo was {{assessed}} {{as a possible}} site for a Commonwealth Solar Observatory, and it became {{the location of the}} facility in 1924. It was operated as a Commonwealth government facility until 1957, when it was transferred to the Australian National University (ANU). From 1944 to 1968 it was also the site of the national <b>time-keeping</b> service. By the early 1980s, Mount Stromlo, together with the ANU's Siding Spring observatory, was producing Australia's greatest astronomical research output.|$|E
5|$|The {{place where}} the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh fenjaan. Usually {{this would be the}} top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another <b>time-keeping</b> tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not {{practical}} for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise <b>time-keeping</b> for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor <b>time-keeping,</b> Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness. She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|South Asian music {{places a}} special {{emphasis}} on drumming, which is freed from the primary <b>time-keeping</b> function of drumming found in {{other part of the}} world. In North India, secular processional bands {{play an important role in}} civic festival parades and the bārāt processions leading a groom's wedding party to the bride's home or the hall where a wedding is held. These bands vary in makeup, depending on the means of the families employing them and according to changing fashions over time, but the core instrumentation is a small group of percussionists, usually playing a frame drum (ḍaphalā), a gong, and a pair of kettledrums (nagāṛā). Better-off families will add shawms (shehnai) to the percussion, while the most affluent who also prefer a more modern or fashionable image may replace the traditional ensemble with a brass band. The Karnatic music of southern India includes a tradition of instrumental temple music in the state of Kerala, called kṣētram vādyam. It includes three main genres, all focussed on rhythm and featuring unpitched percussion. Thayambaka in particular is a virtuoso genre for unpitched percussion only: a solo double-headed cylindrical drum called chenda, played with a pair of sticks, and accompanied by other chenda and elathalam (pairs of cymbals). The other two genres, panchavadyam and pandi melam add wind instruments to the ensemble, but only as accompaniment to the primary drums and cymbals. A panchavadyam piece typically lasts about an hour, while a pandi melam performance may be as long as four hours.|$|E
5|$|Taizu also {{displayed}} {{a strong interest}} in science and technology. He employed the Imperial Workshop to support such projects as Zhang Sixun's hydraulic-powered armillary sphere (for astronomical observation and <b>time-keeping)</b> that used liquid mercury instead of water (because liquid mercury would not freeze during winter). Emperor Taizu was also quite open-minded in his affairs, especially with those perceived as foreigners: he appointed the Arab Muslim Ma Yize (910–1005) as the chief astronomer of the Song court. For receiving envoys from the Korean kingdom of Goryeo alone, the Song court had roughly 1,500 volumes written about the nuanced rules, regulations, and guidelines for their reception. The Song also sent envoys abroad, such as Wang Yande (939–1006), who was sent as an official envoy to the Uyghur-Turkic city of Gaochang in 981, then under Kara-Khanid control. From the 2nd century onwards, ancient Chinese histories even record that embassies of the Roman Empire ("Daqin") and Byzantine Empire ("Fu lin") arrived in China. As recorded in the History of Song and Wenxian Tongkao, the last known arrival of Byzantine envoys came in 1081, apparently sent by Michael VII Doukas to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song. However, the History of Yuan records that a Byzantine man served as an astronomer and physician at the court of Kublai Khan during the subsequent Yuan dynasty, and in 1371 the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty sent an alleged Byzantine merchant (who was likely Nicolaus de Bentra, Archbishop of Khanbaliq) to inform the Byzantine ruler of the founding of the new dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Astronomy, <b>time-keeping</b> and {{geography}} provided other motivations for geometrical and trigonometrical research. For example, Ibrahim ibn Sinan {{and his grandfather}} Thabit ibn Qurra both studied curves required {{in the construction of}} sundials. Abu'l-Wafa and Abu Nasr Mansur both applied spherical geometry to astronomy.|$|E
25|$|NOK460million {{was used}} on {{information}} technology, {{with the main}} system running on an IBM AS/400. 3,500 terminals were in use during the game based on the Info '94 system; {{it was the first}} Olympics to have terminals installed abroad. Seiko delivered the <b>time-keeping</b> devices. Telecommunications were delivered by Norwegian Telecom, including signal transmission. This included a mobile radio network with nine base stations.|$|E
25|$|All processes—chemical, biological, {{measuring}} apparatus functioning, human perception involving {{the eye and}} brain, the communication of force—are constrained by the speed of light. There is clock functioning at every level, dependent on light speed and the inherent delay at even the atomic level. Biological aging, therefore, {{is in no way}} different from clock <b>time-keeping.</b> This means that biological aging would be slowed {{in the same manner as}} a clock.|$|E
25|$|The inaugural {{configuration}} had {{a capacity}} for 10,000 spectators. For the Olympics there were installed a <b>time-keeping</b> system from Longines, ten commentator and press desks with telephones and two telephone booths. A 60-kilowatt, 400 lux floodlight system was installed. The venue was inaugurated on 12 December 1951 with a hockey match between Norway and Switzerland. Jordal was the first artificial ice rink in the Nordic Countries, {{and at the time}} among the most modern hockey rinks in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than three}} years after {{learning}} the moves, Blackburne entered the 1862 London International Tournament (the world's first chess round-robin or all-play-all tournament) and defeated Wilhelm Steinitz in their individual game, although Blackburne finished in 9th place. Up to that point <b>time-keeping</b> was measured with hourglasses, and it was Blackburne who suggested chess clocks. This trip cost Blackburne his job back in Manchester (accounts vary about what it was), and he became a professional chess player.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} in History, advances in <b>time-keeping</b> {{have resulted in}} various time scales. One useful time scale is Universal Time (especially the UT1 variant), which is the mean solar time at 0 degrees longitude (the Greenwich meridian). One second of UT is 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. This time scale {{is known to be}} somewhat variable. Since all civil calendars count actual solar days, they must ultimately be based on UT (but the actual timing of official midnight is based on UTC).|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{daylight}} saving time and a common time zone in Indiana often claim Indiana must adopt the <b>time-keeping</b> system of the Eastern United States to preserve interstate business with that region. Some believe that Indiana businesses have lost hours of productive time with out-of-state colleagues because the time quirks are too confusing {{to keep track of}} on a daily basis. The confusion caused to outsiders featured prominently in the plot of an episode of The West Wing in which presidential aides unfamiliar with Indiana's non-observance of DST miss their return flight to Washington, D.C., on Air Force One and express consternation with the variances in the state's time measurement.|$|E
25|$|The {{nautical}} date line, not {{the same}} as the IDL, is a de jure construction determined by international agreement. It is the result of the 1917 Anglo-French Conference on <b>Time-keeping</b> at Sea, which recommended that all ships, both military and civilian, adopt hourly standard time zones on the high seas. The United States adopted its recommendation for U.S. military and merchant marine ships in 1920. This date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180° meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps—it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. The 15° gore that is offset from UTC by 12 hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5° gores that differ from UTC by ±12 hours.|$|E
25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a large pot full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another <b>time-keeping</b> tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
500|$|The {{stars of}} Auriga feature in Inuit {{constellation}}s. Quturjuuk, meaning [...] "collar-bones", was a constellation that included Capella (Alpha Aurigae), Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum), and Castor (Alpha Geminorum). Its rising signalled that the constellation Aagjuuk, {{made up of}} Altair (Alpha Aquilae), Tarazed (Gamma Aquilae), and sometimes Alshain (Beta Aquilae), would rise soon. Aagjuuk, which represented the dawn following the winter solstice, was an incredibly important constellation in the Inuit mythos. It was also used for navigation and <b>time-keeping</b> at night.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{suffered}} an acknowledged [...] "drumming slump" [...] around 1980, and his <b>time-keeping</b> skills were criticized by Springsteen. What could pass unnoticed in concert became apparent on record, and Weinberg practiced drumming components for months {{in order to}} regain a fine sense of timing. Weinberg also suffered from repetitive stress injury and tendinitis, eventually requiring seven operations {{on his hands and}} wrists. He studied for a while with noted jazz drummer Joe Morello; Weinberg credited Morello for helping him to learn how to play with the tendinitis.|$|E
500|$|The North Atlantic liners prioritised <b>time-keeping</b> {{above all}} other considerations, {{sticking}} rigidly to a schedule that would guarantee their arrival at an advertised time. They were frequently driven {{at close to}} their full speed, treating hazard warnings as advisories rather than calls to action. It was widely believed that ice posed little risk; close calls were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907 , a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but {{was still able to}} complete her voyage. That same year, Titanics future captain, Edward Smith, declared {{in an interview that he}} could not [...] "imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that." ...|$|E
500|$|The arena covers {{an area of}} , and is [...] {{from the}} town center. For the Olympics, [...] of {{cross-country}} tracks and [...] of biathlon tracks were built. There are two stadiums, one for cross-country skiing and one for biathlon. The former has a spectator capacity for 31,000, while the latter has a capacity for 13,500. In addition, up to 75,000 people watched the events the trackside during the Olympics. Permanent buildings include a [...] finishing house for biathlon, a [...] finishing house for cross-country, a [...] plant room. The cross-country stadium is [...] long, while the biathlon stadium is [...] long. The biathlon stadium has 30 shooting stations. The facility has a 1,250kVA transformer, with an additional transformer used during the Olympics. Critical systems, such as computers and <b>time-keeping</b> equipment, have an uninterruptible power supply.|$|E
500|$|WWV's {{primary purpose}} today (and {{for most of}} its existence) is to {{disseminate}} the [...] "official U.S. time" [...] (provided by government entities such as NIST and USNO) to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world. The time signals generated by WWV allow <b>time-keeping</b> devices such as radio-controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment. These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - these include shipping, transport, technology, research, education, military, public safety and telecommunications. It is of particular importance in broadcasting, whether it be commercial, public, or private interests such as amateur radio operators. WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge (other than the cost of the receiving equipment itself).|$|E
500|$|In Quechua it {{was known}} as Colça; the Incas held the star in high regard. The Hawaiians saw Capella {{as part of an}} {{asterism}} Ke ka o Makali'i ("The canoe bailer of Makali'i") that helped them navigate at sea. Called Hoku-lei [...] "star wreath", it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian folklore, Capella was Tahi-ari'i, the wife of Fa'a-nui (Auriga) and mother of prince Ta'urua (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky. In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, [...] "collar-bones", the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each. Used for navigation and <b>time-keeping</b> at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland. The Gwich'in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming shreets'ą įį vidzee, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation Yahdii, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.|$|E
500|$|The 1908 Summer Olympics in London {{were the}} first Games to include figure skating events in the programme, which were staged in October at the Prince's Club. Syers entered both the ladies' event and the pairs with Edgar. In the ladies' event, Syers comfortably won the {{compulsory}} figures section, with all five judges placing her first. The official report of the Games described her as [...] "in a class by herself" [...] and stated that [...] "the wonderful accuracy of her figures, combined with perfect carriage and movement, was the chief feature of the morning's skating." [...] In the free skating, the report described her as having [...] "excelled in rhythm and <b>time-keeping,</b> and her dance steps, pirouettes, , were skated without a fault." [...] She was again placed first by all five judges and won the title. In the pairs event Syers and Edgar finished third (of three couples) and won the bronze medal.|$|E
500|$|In Final Fantasy games, players {{command a}} party of {{characters}} as they progress through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating opponents. Enemies are typically encountered randomly through exploring, a trend which changed in Final FantasyXI and Final FantasyXII. The player issues combat orders—like [...] "Fight", [...] "Magic", and [...] "Item"—to individual characters via a menu-driven interface while engaging in battles. Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. Prior to Final FantasyXI, battles were turn-based with the protagonists and antagonists on different sides of the battlefield. Final FantasyIV introduced the [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] (ATB) system that augmented the turn-based nature with a perpetual <b>time-keeping</b> system. Designed by Hiroyuki Ito, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until Final FantasyX, which implemented the [...] "Conditional Turn-Based" [...] (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. Final FantasyXI adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. Final FantasyXII continued this gameplay with the [...] "Active Dimension Battle" [...] system. Final Fantasy XIIIs combat system, designed by {{the same man who}} worked on X, was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The latest installment to the franchise, Final Fantasy XV, introduces a new [...] "Open Combat" [...] system. Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the [...] "Open Combat" [...] system (OCS) allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat. This system also incorporates a [...] "Tactical" [...] Option during battle, which pauses active battle to allow use of items.|$|E
2500|$|Accurate <b>time-keeping</b> is {{necessary}} for the determination of longitude. [...] As early as 1530, precursors to modern techniques were being explored. [...] However, the most accurate clocks available to these early navigators were water clocks and sand clocks, such as hourglass. [...] Hourglasses were still in use by the Royal Navy of Britain until 1839 for the timing of watches.|$|E
2500|$|Mann {{has been}} {{referred}} to as the [...] "father of wearable computing", having created the first general-purpose wearable computer, in contrast to previous wearable devices that perform one specific function such as <b>time-keeping</b> (e.g. wristwatch), calculations (e.g. wearable abacus), such as Edward O. Thorp and Claude Shannon's, timing devices concealed in shoes cigarette packs for cheating at a game of roulette.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis Mumford has {{proposed}} that the Industrial Revolution had its origins in the Early Middle Ages, much earlier than most estimates. He explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that [...] "the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock". He also cites the monastic emphasis on order and <b>time-keeping,</b> {{as well as the}} fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later, more physical, manifestations such as the steam engine.|$|E
2500|$|Hesiod ( [...] or [...] Hēsíodos) was a Greek poet {{generally}} {{thought by}} scholars {{to have been}} active between 750 and 650 BC, {{around the same time}} as Homer. He is generally regarded as the first written poet in the Western tradition to regard himself as an individual persona with an active role to play in his subject. Ancient authors credited Hesiod and Homer with establishing Greek religious customs. Modern scholars refer to him as a major source on Greek mythology, farming techniques, early economic thought (he is sometimes considered history's first economist), archaic Greek astronomy and ancient <b>time-keeping.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This [...] "measured" [...] and [...] "mechanical" [...] <b>time-keeping</b> {{changed the}} way persons {{experienced}} time. Time {{in the ancient world}} had been marked by the rising of the sun and its setting, the seasons, or the lunar and solar events, by birth and death. With the coming of modern measurements of time, Daniel Boorstin in The Discoverers states that [...] "mankind [...] liberated from the monotony of nature" [...] and [...] "he flow of shadows, sand and water translated into the clock's staccato, became a useful measure [...] of man's movement across the planet" [...] (1). With the increasing dominance of mechanical time in the 1590s—the context of Shakespeare's Sonnet 60—the connection between nature and time began to fracture.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{development}} {{in understanding the}} tropical year {{over long periods of}} time is the discovery that the rate of rotation of the earth, or equivalently, the length of the mean solar day, is not constant. William Ferrel in 1864 and Charles-Eugène Delaunay in 1865 indicated the rotation of the Earth was being retarded by tides. In 1921 William H Shortt invented the Shortt-Synchronome clock, the most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock; it was the first clock capable of measuring variations in the Earth's rotation. The next major <b>time-keeping</b> advance was the quartz clock, first built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton in 1927; in the late 1930s quartz clocks began to replace pendulum clocks as time standards [...]|$|E
2500|$|If, {{instead of}} {{incorporating}} Einstein's clock synchronization (lattice of clocks), the astronaut (outgoing and incoming) and the Earth-based party regularly update {{each other on}} the status of their clocks by way of sending radio signals (which travel at light speed), then all parties will note an incremental buildup of asymmetry in <b>time-keeping,</b> beginning at the [...] "turn around" [...] point. Prior to the [...] "turn around", each party regards the other party's clock to be recording time differently from his own, but the noted difference is symmetrical between the two parties. After the [...] "turn around", the noted differences are not symmetrical, and the asymmetry grows incrementally until the two parties are reunited. Upon finally reuniting, this asymmetry {{can be seen in the}} actual difference showing on the two reunited clocks.|$|E
2500|$|At {{three o'clock}} in the afternoon, the commedia troupe enters the village to the cheering of the villagers. Canio {{describes}} the night's performance: the troubles of Pagliaccio. He says the play will begin at [...] "ventitré ore", an agricultural method of <b>time-keeping</b> that means the play will begin an hour before sunset. As Nedda steps down from the cart, Tonio offers his hand, but Canio pushes him aside and helps her down himself. The villagers suggest drinking at the tavern. Canio and Beppe accept, but Tonio stays behind. The villagers tease Canio that Tonio is planning an affair with Nedda. Canio warns everyone that while he may act the foolish husband in the play, in real life he will not tolerate other men making advances to Nedda. Shocked, a villager asks if Canio really suspects her. He says no, and sweetly kisses her on the forehead. As the church bells ring vespers, he and Beppe leave for the tavern, leaving Nedda alone.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{earliest}} times Greenwich has had {{associations with}} the sea and navigation. It was a landing place for the Romans; Henry VIII lived here; the navy has roots on the waterfront; and Charles II founded the Royal Observatory in 1675 for [...] "finding the longitude of places". The home of Greenwich Mean Time and the Prime Meridian since 1884, Greenwich {{has long been a}} centre for astronomical study, while navigators across the world have set their clocks according to its time of day. The Museum has the most important holdings in the world on the history of Britain at sea comprising more than two million items, including maritime art (both British and 17th-century Dutch), cartography, manuscripts including official public records, ship models and plans, scientific and navigational instruments, instruments for <b>time-keeping</b> and astronomy (based at the Observatory). Its British portraits collection is exceeded in size only by that of the National Portrait Gallery and its holdings relating to Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson and Captain James Cook, among many other individuals, are unrivalled.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Oslo {{was awarded}} the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982, and further {{upgrades}} to the hill were necessary. The costs of the upgrades were NOK50 million, of which the Norwegian Ski Federation paid NOK5 million, and Oslo Municipality and the state split the rest. The large expenditures resulted in a public debate. The upgrades saw the introduction of electronics into {{most parts of the}} venue. The old system of manual distance measurement by people standing beside the hill was abolished, and replaced by the video-based system Robotron. Other new installations was an electronic result and scoreboard system, a new <b>time-keeping</b> and speed system, and a new central system to calculate scores. The in-run was expanded, and a mobile start platform was installed, but later removed and replaced by a bar. The knoll and landing slope were adjusted, and the straight section was moved [...] further down. In the transition to the out-run, [...] of earthwork was blasted away, and Besserudkjernet was sunk another [...] This allowed for additional grandstands to be built and the last wooden grandstands were removed.

2500|$|The casting of Ali was a {{huge problem}} for Holland and Smith. During {{that time in the}} 80s only three Turkish-speaking actors could be located in London, and one of those was {{considered}} unsuitable. The other two, Haluk Bilginer and Nejdet Salih, were possibilities. Deciding which to cast caused major rows between Holland and Smith. Holland favoured Bilginer as he looked the part. He felt Salih did not have the physical presence needed and also believed that Sandy Ratcliff (the actress playing his on-screen wife) would [...] "make mincemeat out of him". Smith disagreed. As Salih was actually an East Londoner whose parents were Turkish Cypriots (whilst Bilginer was Turkish) she felt he would have actual knowledge to bring to the character and wouldn't have to act the part as [...] "he was the part". He also lived in the East End, as did his large family. To resolve the conflict both actors were given readings with Sandy Ratcliff and Salih eventually won the role following a cheeky, sexist remark aimed at Ratcliff and her tardy <b>time-keeping.</b> Both Holland and Smith felt this typified the character perfectly. Ironically, both actors eventually featured in the series, as Bilinger was brought back to take on the role of Ali's older brother.|$|E
2500|$|... “High traits” {{of ancient}} Maya civilization {{prominently}} include hieroglyphic {{writing and the}} Maya Long Count calendar, with the former constituting one of a handful, worldwide, of pristine inventions of writing and the latter comprising {{the invention of the}} concept of zero and other mathematical achievements unequalled at the time in Europe as well as extraordinary achievements in astronomy. Beginning in the Late Preclassic period and proliferating exponentially during the Classic Maya period, Maya texts are dateable because correlation can be made between Maya Long Count dates and the Gregorian calendar. Accordingly, with great certainty we can speak of the Classic period as framed by the large-scale appearance throughout the Maya world by the third to fourth century AD of dated texts on carved monuments, and by the disappearance of these texts on monuments by the 10th century AD. (Consensual acceptance of one correlation between the Maya Long Count and the Gregorian calendar – known as the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson or [...] "G.M.T.” correlation – has come only fairly recently. In this correlation, a beginning date of August 12, 3114 BC, gives the Maya calendar its arrow-of-time character, just as the 0 date for the Christian calendar divides Western <b>time-keeping</b> into an absolute divide by virtue of which an infinite counting of both past and future time is permitted as opposed to “cyclical time.”) ...|$|E
