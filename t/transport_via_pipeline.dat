50|$|Once CO2 is {{captured}} from a gas or coal-fired power plant, {{it would be}} compressed to ≈100 bar {{so that it would}} be a supercritical fluid. In this fluid form, the CO2 would be easy to <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> to the place of storage. The CO2 would then be injected deep underground, typically around 1 km, where it would be stable for hundreds to millions of years. At these storage conditions, the density of supercritical CO2 is 600 to 800 kg / m3. For consumers, the cost of electricity from a coal-fired power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is estimated to be 0.01 - 0.05 $ / kWh higher than without CCS. For reference, the average cost of electricity in the US in 2004 was 0.0762 $ / kWh. In other terms, the cost of CCS would be 20 - 70 $/ton of CO2 captured. The transportation and injection of CO2 is relatively cheap, with the capture costs accounting for 70 - 80% of CCS costs.|$|E

For this purpose, three representative surveys were carried out and analyzed with the methods of descriptive statistics and ordinal regressions. The results of our descriptive statistical analyses show clear regional differences with regard to self-reported awareness, factual knowledge, risk perceptions and general attitudes towards CO 2 offshore/onshore storage and CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline.</b> With regard to {{the public perception}} of the two storage options – offshore and onshore – no major differences could be identified: both are hardly accepted by the German public. In comparison to CO 2 offshore storage/CO 2 onshore storage, the attitudes towards CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> were perceptibly more positive in all regions.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{two studies}} on the perception and acceptance of CCS in Germany: {{the first one is}} a qualitative case study analysis which examined four German projects which were initiated for CO 2 -storage. These include two commercial projects driven by industry (one in North Frisia, the other one in Eastern Brandenburg), a joint research and industry project in the Altmark focusing on Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) and a joint research project at Ketzin. Only one of the four projects, the Ketzin project, was successful in proceeding to CO 2 injection and did not elicit local protest. The comparison of the four cases points to differences in project scale and scope, in the perceived risks and benefits and in the communication processes, all of which have possibly influenced project acceptance. The second study investigated and compared the public perception of CO 2 offshore storage, CO 2 onshore storage and CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> based on a national and two regional surveys. It shows that CCS is not unknown amongst the German public; however, the acceptance of CO 2 storage is low independent of the place of storage.

30|$|This {{increased}} heavy {{crude oil}} and bitumen production requires an adequate means of transporting them for storage or to the refinery. In view of this, pipelines remain the most convenient means for continuous and economic transportation of crude oils and its products. However, {{heavy crude oil}} and bitumen contain {{a high proportion of}} high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as saturates, resins, aromatics and asphaltenes. The asphaltenes portion of the heavy oils is known to be insoluble in straight-chain hydrocarbons such as pentane and heptanes. Therefore, problems due to asphaltenes instability such as precipitation due to depressurisation below asphaltene precipitation onset pressure may occur when transporting heavy crude oil (Eskin et al. 2011). Subsequently, a high-pressure drop along the pipeline is experienced due to high viscosity of the heavy oil making it cost and energy intensive (i.e. higher pump powder) to <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Additionally, clogging of the pipe walls due to asphaltenes deposition, which decreases the accessible cross-sectional area for oil flow that causes reduction in flow rate and rise in pressure drop and multiphase flow, may occur (Martinez-Palou et al. 2011; Eskin et al. 2011).|$|E

30|$|Heavy {{crude oils}} have been {{described}} as a colloidal suspension consisting of solute asphaltenes and a liquid phase maltenes, that is, saturates, aromatics and resins (Saniere et al. 2004). The precipitation and aggregation of the asphaltenes macromolecules in the oil contribute greatly to its high viscosity and density, resulting in its high resistance to flow in pipelines. Therefore, suppressing this effect through the use of pour point depressants will help improve the oil flow properties. The pour of the oil is the lowest temperature at which it ceases to flow and loses its flow properties. For instance, it is extremely difficult to <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> waxy crude oil in cold weather. This is because decreasing temperature causes crystal growth which prevents the molecules of the oil from flowing. The crystallisation depends on climate, oil composition, temperature and pressure during transportation. There are several methods to minimise the cause of wax and asphaltenes deposition, and the use of polymeric inhibitor is considered an attractive alternative. The addition of copolymers such as polyacrylates, polymethacrylate, poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), methacrylate, etc. inhibits the deposition phenomenon and stabilises transportation (Machado et al. 2001; Soldi et al. 2007). Machado et al. (2001) found from the viscosity measurements that only below the temperature at which wax crystals starts forming did the copolymer exhibit a strong influence in the reduction of viscosity.|$|E
40|$|Coal fired power {{generation}} {{will continue to}} provide energy to {{the world for the}} foreseeable future. However, this energy use is a significant contributor to increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration and, hence, global warming. Capture and disposal Of CO 2 has received increased R&D attention in the last decade as the technology promises to be the most cost effective for large scale reductions in CO 2 emissions. This paper addresses CO 2 <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> from capture site to disposal site, in terms of system optimization, energy efficiency and overall economics. Technically, CO 2 can be transported through pipelines {{in the form of a}} gas, a supercritical. fluid or in the subcooled liquid state. Operationally, most CO 2 pipelines used for enhanced oil recovery transport CO 2 as a supercritical fluid. In this paper, supercritical fluid and subcooled liquid transport are examined and compared, including their impacts on energy efficiency and cost. Using a commercially available process simulator, ASPEN PLUS 10. 1, the results show that subcooled liquid transport maximizes the energy efficiency and minimizes the Cost Of CO 2 transport over long distances under both isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Pipeline transport of subcooled liquid CO 2 can be ideally used in areas of cold climate or by burying and insulating the pipeline. In very warm climates, periodic refrigeration to cool the CO 2 below its critical point of 31. 1 degrees C, may prove economical. Simulations have been used to determine the maximum safe pipeline distances to subsequent booster stations as a function of inlet pressure, environmental temperature and ground level heat flux conditions.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} the {{illustration of the}} methodology and the functionality of the CCS value chain tool developed within the BIGCCS Research Centre {{through the use of}} two new transport assessment modules for offshore pipeline and shipping to an offshore site. Technical, costs, and climate impact characteristics of each transport infrastructure are assessed and used to benchmark offshore pipeline and CO 2 shipping to an offshore site transports in a base case for a range of distances and capacities. As expected, the base case illustrates that short distances and large capacities favour pipeline transport while ship transport is favoured by long distances and small capacities. The results show that the distance effect is stronger in the case of transport to an offshore site than in the case of transport between harbours, due to both higher pipeline investment costs and the pipeline pressure drop limitation for offshore. The base case is used to draw conclusions regarding specific case studies under the hypotheses described in this paper. Our methodology also appears to lead to results consistent with cases available in the literature when the same cost hypotheses are taken into consideration. Sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the impact of several important parameters and show that the four most influential parameters regarding the transport technology selection are: (1) the geographical context through the distance ratio, (2) the regional effect of pipeline costs and uncertainties in pipeline investment costs through the pipeline investment costs, (3) the project ownership effect through the discount rate, and (4) the First Of A Kind effect and uncertainties on investments through the overall investment costs. The CO 2 avoided transport costs of the two transport technologies are illustrated in order to emphasise the importance of selecting the most efficient transport technology. The evaluation of costs underlines the fact that knowing the actual costs and limiting uncertainties is very important for the selection of the cost-optimal technology, to avoid cost overruns, and limit financial risks. The cost evaluation is also used to demonstrate the impact of limiting transport cost on the conditions in which CO 2 transport is economically viable. The results demonstrate that the stronger the cost constraint, the more “long” distances and “small” capacities should be ruled out. The methodology and results are also used to illustrate how constraint on initial investment, in order to limit financial exposure, is to the disadvantage of pipeline transport due to the large investments required for <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|LNG, Competition and Security of Supply: the Role of Shipping - In {{the last}} few years, {{one of the main}} {{concerns}} of European Union in the energetic field has been that of facilitating the safeguard of raw materials’ security of supply, especially that of natural gas. Import through LNG chain, that is, through the employment of LNG tankers for gas transportation, has been identified by the European Council as one of the instruments to achieve these goals. In fact, import via LNG does not require, for the importer, such investments as to determine an indissoluble physical tie between producer and buyer, as happens for <b>transport</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> (Chernyavs’ka et al., 2002). In other words, investments in pipelines are very specific. Moreover, as they are made in order to support specific transactions, contracts usually take the form of long-term agreements with minimum offtake requirements (take or pay clauses) : such contracts definitely contribute to the "cartelization" of the market, hindering competition. Unlike investments in pipelines, those in the LNG chain present a much lower degree of specificity: in fact, even though the construction of a regasification plant is generally tied to the stipulation of a long-term agreement (with take or pay clause), LNG chain costs have significantly decreased over time (until a few years ago) and, moreover, it is getting increasingly common that part of plant capacity is made available for spot transactions. What’s more, once the contract is expired and the investment is sunk, the importer may satisfy his gas supply needs {{on the basis of his}} relative gains. As far as LNG import contractual practices are concerned, significant changes have started to take places in {{the last few}} years, both in terms of agreements’ length - average duration has significantly decreased - and in terms of price indexation - in the most developed markets LNG price is tied to gas spot price (IEA, 2006). One of the many possible advantages of transport via LNG is that liquefied gas enables European importers to widen their gas suppliers portfolio. Increased possibilities of choice for importers, the widening of the group of exporting countries, and the increased integration of the European market, thanks to the possibility of redirecting cargoes depending on single countries’ supply-demand balance, would contribute decisively to security of supply, market globalization and competition (between importers) in the industry (IEA, 2004). Yet, it must be stressed that import via tanker appears to be competitive with import via pipe only for the medium-long distances. As far as LNG chain is concerned, the element that so far has attracted the least attention, though being not less important than the other two, is certainly shipping. Being the link between the producing/exporting country and the importing country, and having been subject to major changes in the last few years, it is particularly interesting to analyze it singularly, aiming to understand how it is linked to the other elements of LNG value chain, besides studying industry dynamics. This paper will address this issue, aiming also to understand what has been and what will be in the future the evolutionary trajectory of this segment, starting from an analysis of operative and planned gas tankers, their size, their routes and their contractual situation. This analysis can be useful to make hypothesis about the growth of the spot market and, consequently, of market liquidity.

40|$|In {{this era}} of {{globalisation}} and modernisation, natural gas is {{becoming one of the}} most wanted natural resources in many industries basically for cooling and heating purpose. Due to the high demand, <b>transporting</b> natural gas <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{is the best way to}} fulfil the demand for natural gas. Hence, it is very important to <b>transport</b> natural gas <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> with safety precaution. Meanwhile, in future hydrogen gas has the capability to become one of the important energy resources for many industries. This will create an economy call hydrogen economy. It is expected hydrogen can become main source of energy to replace fossil fuels and can be <b>transported</b> <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> to meet customers demand. However, the physical properties of methane and hydrogen are totally different and also the safety to supply hydrogen <b>via</b> <b>pipeline</b> is taken into consideration. Therefore, this paper is aim to study about the dispersion effects of hydrogen and methane and do comparison among both gases. In this paper we will be using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software to detect leakage when transporting methane and hydrogen gas. The model that will be use is environmental area 240 m wide and 80 m high. Two 30 m wide and 20 m high buildings are placed to represent factory building. Underneath, a part of pipeline is modelled as a source where methane and hydrogen gases are released. The 2 m diameter pipeline is filled with either hydrogen gas or methane gas at pressure 11 bars. The leak in the pipe is located at x= 0 m. This study will be done by using different scenarios at different time interval which is at time 1 s and 7. 5 s and different wind speed; 0 m/s, 5 m/s, 10 m/s ad 15 m/s. The results show that, the rate of dispersion of hydrogen is higher compare to methane and methane tends to be more on the surface of the ground where ignition is possible. Using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) is the best method to study about leakage of methane and hydrogen gas due to low cost involve rather than building up pipeline network to test the situation which is something irrational to be done. From this study, it can be clearly seen that the rate of dispersion of hydrogen will be higher compare to methane due to the gases properties like density and buoyancy force.
