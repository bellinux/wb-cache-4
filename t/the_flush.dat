5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling <b>the</b> <b>flush</b> with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is setting an operational pattern of <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> gate due to the annual sedimentation rate in the Sei Tibun Weir, Kampar Region, Riau Province. The problem arouse because there is no operation manual of <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> gate at <b>the</b> Weir that make the officer difficult to decide <b>the</b> exact sediment <b>flushing</b> time and <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> gate. <b>The</b> field condition showed that the officer must clean the sediment at the irrigation canal manually, which can be evaded with a routine sediment <b>flushing.</b> <b>The</b> method used to describe the operational pattern of <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> gate considering <b>the</b> hydraulic aspects was a physical modeling with 1 : 1 scale, which was the Sei Tibun Weir itself. The actual field condition approached with idealization shapes to simplify the calculation procedure. The main result of this research showed the value of the annual sedimentation rate in the Sei Tibun Weir was 13. 320, 65 m 3 /year. In order to achieve a longer service function of <b>the</b> Weir, routine <b>flushing</b> needed every 8 months with the size of <b>the</b> <b>flushing</b> gate was 31. 7 cm if one flushing gate operated for 6 hours.

5000|$|Dissatisfied with NY&F's service, Residents of Flushing and Newtown {{convinced}} the LIRR to build <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside Railroad, on February 24, 1864 as a competing branch to Flushing, which ran from Woodside Station toward Great Neck Junction. When the NY&F collapsed after {{construction of the}} Great Neck Extension, the LIRR acquired the railroad and left this branch unfinished. After Poppenhausen created <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and North Side Railroad, he also acquired <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside, but was able to complete construction of the line, which became the Woodside Branch of <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and North Side.

25|$|In ancient times, {{the float}} valve {{was used to}} {{regulate}} {{the flow of water}} in Greek and Roman water clocks; similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in <b>the</b> <b>flush</b> toilet.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of the {{industrial}} revolution and related advances in technology, <b>the</b> <b>flush</b> toilet began to emerge into its modern form. It needs to be connected to a sewer system though. Where this is not feasible or desired, dry toilets are an alternative option.|$|E
25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (<b>the</b> <b>flush</b> valve seat) by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user pushes a lever, which lifts <b>the</b> <b>flush</b> valve from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with much}} of the rest of the subway system, <b>the</b> IRT <b>Flushing</b> Line was allowed to {{deteriorate}} throughout the 1970s to the late 1980s.

50|$|Also {{within the}} 1850s, the New York and Flushing Railroad built a {{railroad}} line {{across the river}} leading to {{what was then a}} railroad terminal {{on the east side of}} <b>the</b> river in <b>Flushing.</b> <b>The</b> railroad was acquired by <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and North Side Railroad in 1868, and built junctions with <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside Railroad, the Whitestone and Westchester Railroad, and the Central Railroad of Long Island on the west side of the river throughout <b>the</b> 1870s. <b>The</b> <b>Flushing</b> and North Side also built a spur leading to Flushing Bay just southwest of <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> River delta.

25|$|Electronic {{automatic}} flushes {{solve the}} problems of previous approaches, and are common in new installations. A passive infrared sensor identifies when the urinal has been used, by detecting when someone has stood in front of it and moved away, and then activates <b>the</b> <b>flush.</b> There usually is also a small override button, to allow optional manual flushing.|$|E

25|$|Dual flush toilets {{allow the}} user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a {{significant}} amount of water over conventional units. <b>The</b> <b>flush</b> handle on some of these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other.

25|$|This {{system does}} not require any action from its users, but it is {{wasteful}} of water when toilets are used irregularly. However, in these countries users are so used to the automatic system, that attempts to install manual flushes to save water are generally unsuccessful.

25|$|The double trap siphonic toilet is a {{less common}} type that is {{exceptionally}} quiet when flushed. There is a device known as an aspirator which uses {{the flow of water}} on a flush to suck air from the cavity between the two traps, reducing the air pressure there to create the siphon which sucks water and waste from the toilet bowl. Towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>flush</b> the aspirator ceases being covered in water, thus allowing air into the cavity between traps to break the siphon without the noise while the final flush water fills the pan.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Flushing</b> Branch, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> Village Railroad was a short spur {{southeast}} from the Port Washington Branch in Flushing.

50|$|Flushing citizens, {{feeling they}} had been tricked into {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside in order to scare <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and North Side into selling out to the LIRR, convinced wealthy residents of College Point and Whitestone, including Conrad Poppenhusen, to incorporate <b>the</b> <b>Flushing</b> and North Side Railroad in 1868. This company {{had the right to}} build a line from Long Island City to Flushing and beyond to Roslyn, with a branch from <b>Flushing</b> to Whitestone. <b>The</b> group gained control of <b>the</b> unfinished <b>Flushing</b> and Woodside Railroad, and opened its line to <b>Flushing,</b> paralleling <b>the</b> LIRR from Long Island City to Woodside, in 1868 and to College Point and Whitestone in 1869. This new line attracted most of the traffic from the older New York and <b>Flushing,</b> and <b>the</b> LIRR {{wanted to get rid of}} its Flushing branch.
