25|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>drawing</b> is {{a process}} to size a tube by {{shrinking}} a large diameter tube into a smaller one, by drawing the tube through a die. This process produces high-quality tubing with precise dimensions, good surface finish, and the added strength of cold working. For this reason this process is established for many materials, namely metalworking but also glass. Because it is so versatile, <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> is suitable for both large- and small-scale production. The large-scale production of glass typically uses a one step process where glass is directly drawn into a tube from a melting tank.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>drawing</b> is {{very similar}} to bar drawing, except the {{beginning}} stock is a tube. It is used to decrease the diameter, improve surface finish and improve dimensional accuracy. A mandrel {{may or may not be}} used depending on the specific process used.|$|E
25|$|Fixed plug drawing, {{also known}} as {{stationary}} mandrel drawing, uses a mandrel {{at the end of}} the die to shape the ID of the tube. This process is slow and the area reductions are limited, but it gives the best inner surface finish of any of the processes. This is the oldest <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> method.|$|E

2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and <b>tube</b> <b>drawing.</b> The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and <b>tube</b> <b>drawing</b> the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E
2500|$|Tube sinking, {{also known}} as free <b>tube</b> <b>drawing,</b> reduces the {{diameter}} of the tube without a mandrel inside the tube. The inner diameter (ID) is determined by the inner and outer diameter of the stock tube, the outer diameter of the final product, the length of the die landing, the amount of back tension, and the friction between the tube and the die. This type of drawing operation is the most economical, especially on thick-walled tubes and tubes smaller than [...] in diameter, but does not give the best surface finish. As the tube thickness increases the surface finish quality decreases. This process is often used for the tubing on low-cost lawn furniture.|$|E

40|$|Cold {{drawing is}} widely {{applied in the}} {{industrial}} production of seamless tubes, employed for various mechanical applications. During pre-processing, deviations in tools and their adjustment lead to inhomogeneities in the geometry of the tubes and cause a gradient in residuals. In this paper a three dimensional finite element (3 D-FE) -model is presented which was developed to calculate the change in wall thickness, eccentricity, ovality and residual macro-stress state of the tubes, produced by cold drawing. The model simulates the <b>drawing</b> process of <b>tubes,</b> <b>drawn</b> with and without a plug. For finite element modelling, the commercial software package Abaqus was used. To validate the model, neutron strain imaging measurements were performed on the strain imaging instrument SALSA at the Institute Laue Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France) {{on a series of}} SF-copper <b>tubes,</b> <b>drawn</b> under controlled laboratory conditions, varying the drawing angle and the plug geometry.

50|$|Until the 19th century glass tubes were {{exclusively}} {{produced by}} mouth blowing, thus discontinuously manufactured from a batch or a glass melt. In 1912, E.

5000|$|An {{example of}} one type of mandrel is a shaped bar of metal {{inserted}} in, or next to, an item to be machined or bent in a certain pattern, e.g. in <b>tube</b> <b>drawing.</b> Exhaust pipes for automobiles are frequently bent using a mandrel during manufacture. The mandrel allows the exhaust pipes to be bent into smooth curves without undesirable creasing, kinking, or collapsing. Molten glass may be shaped in this way as well.
