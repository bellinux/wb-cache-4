500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of every morning when I wake and the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked how}} KFC felt about their {{portrayal}} in [...] "Medicinal Fried Chicken", company spokesman Ricky Maynard said only: [...] "As you might expect, KFC Corporation was not contacted by Comedy Central {{for permission to}} use our brand in South Park. We had absolutely no say in the show's content." [...] Corbin Tourism Chairperson Suzie Razmus viewed the association of Corbin with KFC as positive publicity, regardless of the show's tone. The city embarked on a campaign to capitalize on its connections to KFC and Colonel Sanders, and Sharae Myers, the city's Main Street manager, said of the episode, [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is great is that Corbin got the recognition: that the mecca for KFC is in Corbin." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 19, 2011, {{the first}} part of a concert's behind the scenes video was released. In the behind the scenes special, lead guitarist Bibi stated [...] "She's {{listening}} to her inner voice right now and doing what she wants to do. I think she took risks. I think she's being more authentic and doing what she wants to do instead of doing what people expect, which is good." [...] Kim, the show's musical director described the idea of the intimate concert, [...] "This project is the most mature project for Beyoncé, because {{to be able to be}} in an intimate setting like this like the Roseland, which is a historic place, it's an amazing <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the challenge of it is to be able to present your whole album as its own concept, as its own piece and it's a great way to educate the people about what this album means to her; It's for her, it's for the fans, it's for anybody." ...|$|E

500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E
500|$|Cody crafted {{the story}} to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a {{sacrifice}} which goes awry. Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and {{it is up to}} Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. [...] "It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort of <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. [...] "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. [...] "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2012, it was {{confirmed}} by Daniel Kilkelly, a reporter for Digital Spy, that a new storyline would see Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Fatboy spend the night together after he rescues her when she gets unwanted attention from a man. Norwood, who plays Fatboy, told Inside Soap, [...] "Right now, I don't think Fatboy is looking for love - but he's happy to be swept off his feet by Denise, who's this hot older woman he never imagined he could be with."Denise is a scorching woman - she's got a dynamite body and a beautiful smile. She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she might worry that people were saying things about her. Right now, she's just enjoying herself." [...] Norwood added that while the pair's relationship was sexual, a serious future for them could be possible.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> because I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E
500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E

2500|$|David Cheal of the Financial Times {{wrote about}} their {{rendition}} of [...] "Wild Thing" [...] ": [...] "Perhaps {{the most striking}} of those 7,500-odd licensed recordings [...] is [...] on which Siouxsie’s chilly multitracked vocals (at one point she chants “Wild <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I hate you”) are accompanied only by Budgie’s tribal-sounding drums. It’s a version that taps into the earthy, elemental spirit of the song, channelling those few minutes back in 1964 when Chip Taylor lost himself {{in the darkness of}} a New York studio".|$|E
2500|$|During an April 11, 2010, {{appearance}} on CNN, host Candy Crowley {{asked if it}} had been insensitive for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell to omit mentioning slavery in a proposed recognition of Confederate History Month.

[...] Barbour continued, [...] "I don't know what you would say about slavery ... but anybody that thinks that you have to explain to people that slavery is a bad <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that goes without saying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rollins told Alan Sculley of The Daily Herald {{that this}} reunion with Haskett, Gibbs and Cain would not become {{long-term}} unless the group {{decided to write}} new songs: [...] "Let's put it this way. I don't {{want to go out}} and hit America again without a new record, or at least a new album's worth of material. Otherwise the thing will lack legitimacy ... Miles Davis would never do that. And I'm not into a greatest-hits <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a band, if you're going to be around, you should be moving forward and putting in the time and working for it, getting after the art. Otherwise you're just playing retreads. ... Imagine a tree that grows canned peaches. It's nothing I want to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and that got to be the really fun <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When I Reach For My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a recent}} interview, Tyler responded to such criticisms:”For one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it is sort}} of true. I would say piss and vinegar for [...] Roth and for me milk and cookies. I can’t deny it…. [...] there’s more edge under some of my soft {{language}} than people realize.” [...] Because almost all of Tyler’s work covers the same territory—family and marriage relationships—and are located in the same setting, she has come under criticism for being repetitive and formulaic. [...] Reviewing The Patchwork Planet, Kakutani states: “Ms. Tyler's earlier characters tended to be situated within a thick matrix of finely nuanced familial relationships that helped define both their dreams and their limitations; the people in this novel, in contrast, seem much more like lone wolves, pulled this way and that by the author's puppet strings….Ms. Tyler’s famous ability to limn the daily minutiae of life also feels weary and formulaic this time around….As for the little details Ms. Tyler sprinkles over her story…they, too, have a paint-by-numbers touch. They add up to a patchwork novel that feels hokey, mechanical [...] [...] [...] and yes, too cute.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{idea for}} Wild Things, and the Creatures, came about during the {{recording}} sessions for the Siouxsie and the Banshees album Juju. While bassist Steven Severin and guitarist John McGeoch took a break, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie created the song [...] "But Not Them." [...] Deciding {{that it was}} complete as a drum-and-voice piece, they left it alone, and quickly recorded four more minimal tracks to accompany it. The result was the Wild Things EP (so named by Severin, who upon hearing it, said it sounded like something the creatures in the book Where the Wild Things Are would have danced to on their island). The only cover version of the ep was The Troggs' [...] "Wild Thing": Siouxsie included extra angry lyrics to the original: [...] "Wild <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I hate you/but I wanna know for sure/so come on, hit me hard/I hate you". [...] "So Unreal" [...] drew inspiration from the novel The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin and [...] "Mad Eyed Screamer" [...] from local characters met in Hyde Park, London. The duo incorporated the songs [...] "But Not Them", [...] "So Unreal" [...] and [...] "Thumb" [...] into the Banshees concerts for many years afterwards.|$|E
