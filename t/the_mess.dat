5|$|What {{is utterly}} dismaying is <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> our milling and baking {{concerns}} succeed in making with the dearly bought grain {{that goes into}} their grist.

Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men.
