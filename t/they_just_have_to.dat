500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

Now, people always say, 'You're being too modest, you're being too modest', and I say, 'What?' <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask me the right question. I know it's not good artwork and I don't know if it's well-drawn, but I know it's entertaining." [...] – Don Rosa, Torino Comics Festival, April 2011 ...|$|E

50|$|According to Politico, the {{movement}} owed in 2016 the European Parliament €535,818. The reasons given by Politico were the forbidden use of European grants by the MENL party to finance national {{political parties and}} referendum campaigns. The party strongly denied these allegations by saying that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give the unused EU funds back to the European Parliament.|$|R
5000|$|When I was in university, {{there was}} this major {{historian}} of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, 'The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a raving anti-Semite. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be apathetic.|$|R

50|$|Riaz & Tanveer (n.d) {{wrote that}} Place {{refers to the}} {{availability}} of the product to the targeted customers. So a product or company doesn’t have to be close to where its customer base is but instead <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make their product as available as possible. This improves efficiency and therefore price can be dropped intern increasing sales and profit. For max profits a company's distribution channels must be effective in enticing the customer.|$|E
2500|$|The film officially began {{principal}} {{photography in}} March 2010, {{but due to}} its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "This movie was made over four years, and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait {{for a year or}} two years for different actors.

60|$|Now what old Granny Fox {{had seen}} was Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy Possum rolling {{over and over}} in the dried leaves, turning somersaults, and {{shouting}} and laughing, while Prickly Porky sat looking on and smiling. Granny knew well enough what was tickling them so, and she knew too that they didn't dream but that she was still running away in fright. At last they were so tired with their good time that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop for a rest.|$|R
50|$|A {{special feature}} of the town is the old prison. It was erected without bars. The prisoners could freely walk around town and {{establish}} or maintain families here. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return to the prison in the evening. Escapes were rare because of the remoteness of Mulegé. Until Mex 1 was paved, the area was surrounded by harsh desert for many miles. All prisoners <b>had</b> <b>to</b> agree to assist in tracking any escapist and assist in their capture. Today, the old prison is operated as a museum, with a suggested nominal entry fee.|$|R

5000|$|The labeled release {{experiment}} used nutrients tagged with 14C. It then {{monitored the}} air above the experiment for radioactive 14CO2 gas {{as evidence that the}} nutrients had been taken up by micro-organisms. This experiment produced positive results. Also, in this case, the control experiments came out negative. Normally this would suggest a biological explanation. For this experiment the microbes don't have to grow, reproduce. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> metabolize the organics and produce the 14CO2 gas in the process.|$|E
50|$|Another {{body part}} is found. This time a severed foot {{by an old}} soccer field where Dexter played as a child. He tells Doakes that the killer is sending a message that is more {{important}} than the ritual, but cannot tell him what, or why.

LaGuerta phones Tony's mother to tell her that her son may still be alive and that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find him.|$|E

Kase explained what happened to himself in 'Style Wars': [...] "It wasn't no severely bad accident, just that I got burnt by wires, that's all... electrical wires, and then they rushed me to the hospital and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> amputate...

5000|$|On October 5, 2007, Carlson {{hosted a}} {{gathering}} of world-famous chefs at Schwa as part of Charlie Trotter's 20th anniversary celebration.

5000|$|October Sky is an anagram of Rocket Boys, {{the title}} of the 1998 book upon which the movie is based.

Homer Hickam stated that [...] "Universal Studios marketing people got involved and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change the title because, according to their research, women over thirty would never see a movie titled Rocket Boys" [...] so Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience. The book was later re-released with the name in order to capitalize on interest in the movie.|$|R
5000|$|Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator, on {{the other}} hand, shouldn't have worked. The guy is {{supposed}} to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely. —James Cameron on casting Schwarzenegger.|$|E
5000|$|The group {{shows up}} to class, but without their terrariums {{as a result}} {{of not being able to}} resolve their issues. (Annie does {{actually}} complete hers, causing Jeff to label her as pathological.) Troy says that their ideas didn't work out. Jeff suggests <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work with their original lab partners. Professor Kane calls them [...] "the mean clique," [...] saying that Todd called him crying about the way he was treated. This seems to sober the group up enough to realize their mistakes. However, they later blame Todd for all their problems.|$|E

60|$|Next morning Dullhead {{tucked the}} goose {{under his arm}} and went off, without in the least troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on <b>to</b> it. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> run after him right or left as best they could. In the middle of a field they met the parson, and when he saw this {{procession}} he cried: 'For shame, you bold girls! What do you mean by running after a young fellow through the fields like that? Do you call that proper behaviour?' And with that he caught the youngest girl by the hand to try and draw her away. But directly he touched her he hung on himself, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> run {{along with the rest of}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{the others}} laughed. The {{very idea of}} such a tiny fellow going out to dare {{the dangers of the}} unknown Great World seemed to them so absurd that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> laugh. But King Eagle didn't laugh. He thanked Hummer and told him that his heart was as big as his body was small, but that he would not send him out into the Great World, for he would go himself. He had been but trying out his subjects, and he had found but one who was worthy, and that one was the {{smallest}} of them all. Then King Eagle said things that made all the other birds hang their heads for shame and want to sneak out of sight.|$|R
