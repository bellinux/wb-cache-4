Studies performed in Europe, such as those of John Hughlings Jackson, supported this view. Jackson studied patients with brain damage, particularly those with epilepsy. He discovered that the epileptic patients often made the same clonic and <b>tonic</b> <b>movements</b> of muscle during their seizures, leading Jackson to believe that they must be occurring in the same place every time. Jackson proposed that specific functions were localized to specific areas of the brain, which was critical to future understanding of the brain lobes.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of microinjected drugs and {{brainstem}} lesions on motor and limbic seizures in the kindling model of epilepsy. The duration of motor seizures was determined by timing the clonic and <b>tonic</b> <b>movements</b> of the extremities. The. duration of limbic seizures was determined by measuring afterdischarge recorded on the electroencephalogram. Bilateral microinjection of a y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, muscimol, into {{the area of the}} substantia nigra (SN) markedly suppressed both motor and limbic seizures induced by stimulation of amygdala, olfactory structures, or lateral entorhinal cortex. Microinjection of saline did not suppress seizures. The suppressive effect of muscimol: (i) dissipated after several hours and was dependent on dose; (ii) was due to an elevation of the seizure threshold, since typical seizures could be elicited with electrical current far exceeding the threshold; and (iii) exhibited spatial specificity since muscimol injections 1 to 2 mm dorsal to the SN or into neocortex did not suppress the seizures. The actions of muscimol were probably mediated by its GABA agonist properties, since microinjection of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase (y-vinyl GABA) into the area of the SN also suppressed kindled seizures...|$|R

40|$|The tonotopic {{organization}} of the mammalian cochlea is accompanied by structural gradients which include the somatic lengths of outer hair cells (OHCs). These receptors rest upon the vibrating portion of the basilar membrane and {{have been reported to}} exhibit motile responses following chemical and electrical stimulation. These movements were examined in detail in this dissertation. It was found that isolated OHCs cultured in vitro respond to chemical depolarization with slow <b>tonic</b> <b>movements,</b> and to electrical waveforms with bi-directional, frequency following movements extending from DC to at least 10 kHz. ^ Slow contractions were also elicited following electrical stimulation, bath incubation in carbachol (a cholinergic agonist), and increases in extracellular K+ concentration as little as 50 mM. ^ Isolated OHCs display anatomical features which are remarkable when contrasted with those prepared from intact receptor organs. A complex structure located between the cuticular plate and the nuclear membrane was consistently observed and was examined by serial cross-sections which revealed a network of non-membrane bound densities. This corresponded to a granular complex seen at the light microscope level. The complex was composed of dense regions of organelles, striated structures embedded within the core, and a circumferential network of microtubules residing in the peri-nuclear portion of the cell. In cells which had lost their nuclear attachment to the terminal synaptic body, the granular complex could be made to contract without effecting any change in cellular length, implying that the complex may be the driving force behind certain aspects of the motile response. ^ Most cells displayed movements which revealed asymmetries analogous to those reported for OHC receptor potentials in vivo. The contraction phase (for longer cells) was shown to have a small time constant (approximately 400 microseconds) and saturated with limited displacements. The expansion phase had time constants as large as 1. 3 milliseconds but yielded displacements as much as 60 percent larger than those seen for contractions. ^ Additional waveform characteristics seen in the in vivo response could be emulated either by biasing the cell 2 ̆ 7 s resting length with either direct current, triggering contractions via large electrical displacements, or incubation with depolarizing compounds. ^ Alternatively, short (20 - 30 um) cells revealed more linear response characteristics to the probe stimulus. Partial saturation was achieved and revealed a DC component which was opposite in polarity to that seen in longer cells. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.) ...|$|R

40|$|In 19 th century Britain, the {{expanding}} middle classes and their aspirations to distinction through cultural capital {{led to a}} change in the perception of cultural products and their status. The century witnessed extraordinary cultural growth and diversification, especially in musical works and activities. In this period there was a gradual separation between music perceived to be 'art' and that seen as 'popular'. From the 1830 s, supported by new upwardly mobile consumers, art music evolved greater complexity, whilst new popular forms and styles, such as opera fantasies, ballads and blackface minstrelsy, proliferated in counterbalance. Social groupings began to distinguish themselves through the kind of cultural products they preferred and in England the upper middle classes moved into positions of cultural leadership, for example running the Philharmonic Society of London and initiating the <b>Tonic</b> Sol Fa <b>movement.</b> This evolving cultural landscape with its potential for distinctions of taste, power and class was imported to Australia by successive waves of immigrants.

40|$|When {{somatosensory}} input via {{electrical stimulation}} of a peripheral nerve precedes a {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) pulse over the primary motor cortex (M 1) the corticospinal output is substantially reduced, a phenomenon known as short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). The present study investigated SAI during rest and during pre-movement, phasic and <b>tonic</b> components of <b>movement.</b> Participants were required to perform an index finger flexion reaction time task {{in response to an}} auditory cue. In a series of experiments, SAI was evoked from the mixed, median nerve at the wrist or the cutaneous, digital nerve stimulation of the index finger. To assess the spinal versus cortical origin of movement-related modulation of SAI, F-wave amplitudes were measured during rest and the three movement components. Results indicated that SAI was reduced during all movement components compared to rest, an effect that occurred for both nerves stimulated. Pre-movement SAI reduction was primarily attributed to reduced cortical inhibition, while increased spinal excitability additionally contributed to reduced SAI during tonic and phasic components of movement. SAI was differentially modulated across movement components with mixed but not cutaneous nerve stimulation. These findings reveal that SAI is reduced during movement and this reduction begins as early as the preparation to move. Further, these data suggest that the degree of SAI reduction during movement may be specific to the volume and/or composition of afferent input carried by each nerve...|$|R
40|$|Many {{behavior}} {{patterns of the}} crayfish involve the positioning of the abdomen by the <b>tonic</b> motor system. <b>Movements</b> and positionings of the swimmerets are coordinated with these abdominal movements. Evidence from extracellular analyses suggested that single interneurons of the abdominal nerve cord could produce motor outputs in both the swimmeret and the abdominal positioning systems. Our intracellular investigation has revealed that many single cells can evoke outputs in both motor systems. Interneurons which produced fictive extension or flexion of the abdomen or inhibition of abdominal movement were also able to modulate a variety of swimmeret behavior including cyclic beating and excitation or inhibition of episodic outputs. Although interneurons were dis-covered that evoked each of the possible classes of dual-output combinations, those that evoked combinations frequently observed in the freely behaving animal were more common than those that evoked infrequently observed combinations. Evidence also indicated that abdominal positioning inhibitors are present in greater numbers than previously suspected and that many are {{closely associated with the}} swimmeret circuitry. Interneurons with the ability to start and stop swimmeret cyclic outputs with current injections of opposite polarity are proposed to be higher-order cells, and some are shown to have the properties of trigger neurons. It is proposed that most dual-output cells are presynaptic to single-output cells and that groups of related dual-output cells may function together as command elements...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) is {{a common}} {{paroxysmal}} disorder that is often misdiagnosed as a seizure disorder. Head up tilt test (HUTT) {{has been used to}} confirm this diagnosis. There is no data available of its use in children / adolescents from India. AIM: To study the usefulness of the HUTT in children and adolescents with suspected NCS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a part retrospective and later prospective study set in a tertiary child neurology outpatient department (OPD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with a strong clinical suspicion of syncope were recruited for the study. Clinical and treatment details were either retrieved from the chart or prospectively recorded in later patients. The HUTT was then carried out at baseline and after provocation and the results correlated with the clinical diagnosis. Results: Eighteen children {{with a mean age of}} 10. 8 years were studied. Eight had precipitating factors. Thirteen had premonitory symptoms. Pallor, temperature change, diaphoresis, headache, <b>tonic</b> / clonic <b>movements,</b> post-ictal confusion and peri-ictal headache were symptoms noticed. Sixteen had a positive HUTT. Seven were on long-term anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Two had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalogram (EEG). CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of syncope is often confused with epilepsy. Head up tilt test has a high sensitivity in the diagnosis of NCS in children / adolescents. It is fairly safe and easy to perform...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{sound with}} a {{frequency}} of around 40 Hz can be heard, with a stethoscope, in {{the muscles of}} the hand and forearm during <b>tonic</b> contraction or <b>movement.</b> This sound is the acoustic correlate of the Piper rhythm seen in electromyographic records of muscle activity. The way in which motor activity is organised at the cortical level may determine the frequency of the sound heard. METHODS: The wrist extensor muscles in the forearm of seven patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, studied with and without antiparkinsonian treatment, and a control group of seven healthy men were auscultated during very strong extension of the wrist and during repeated slow flexion and extension of this joint. FINDINGS: In healthy people, the Piper-band sound made by muscle activity is 40 - 50 Hz. In all seven parkinsonian patients, when off medication, the normal Piper-band sound was replaced by a pulsatile muscle activity of 10 Hz during strong wrist extension, and in four patients during repeated flexion and extension of the wrist. After treatment with dopaminergic drugs, the Piper mode of muscle discharge was restored and motor performance was improved. INTERPRETATION: The Piper mode of muscle discharge is dependent on the normal functioning of pallidal projections to the motor areas of the cortex. In abnormal function a muscle discharge of 10 Hz dominates, which is suboptimal when fast or powerful contractions are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Mutations of the LGI 1 (leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1) gene {{underlie}} {{autosomal dominant}} lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, a focal idiopathic inherited epilepsy syndrome. The LGI 1 gene encodes a protein secreted by neurons, {{one of the}} only non-ion channel genes implicated in idiopathic familial epilepsy. While mutations probably result in a loss of function, the role of LGI 1 in the pathophysiology of epilepsy remains unclear. Here we generated a germline knockout mouse for LGI 1 and examined spontaneous seizure characteristics, changes in threshold for induced seizures and hippocampal pathology. Frequent spontaneous seizures emerged in homozygous LGI 1 −/− mice during the second postnatal week. Properties of these spontaneous events were examined in a simultaneous video and intracranial electroencephalographic recording. Their mean duration was 120 ± 12 [*]s, and behavioural correlates consisted of an initial immobility, automatisms, sometimes followed by wild running and <b>tonic</b> and/or clonic <b>movements.</b> Electroencephalographic monitoring indicated that seizures originated earlier in the hippocampus than in the cortex. LGI 1 −/− mice did not survive beyond postnatal day 20, probably due to seizures and failure to feed. While no major developmental abnormalities were observed, after recurrent seizures we detected neuronal loss, mossy fibre sprouting, astrocyte reactivity and granule cell dispersion in the hippocampus of LGI 1 −/− mice. In contrast, heterozygous LGI 1 +/− littermates displayed no spontaneous behavioural epileptic seizures, but auditory stimuli induced seizures at a lower threshold, reflecting the human pathology of sound-triggered seizures in some patients. We conclude that LGI 1 +/− and LGI 1 −/− mice may provide useful models for lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, and more generally idiopathic focal epilepsy...|$|R

40|$|The EMG of the soleus muscle was {{recorded}} with bipolar electrodes chronically implanted in rats aged 10 - 30 days. Changes {{in the activity}} pattern were studied in relation to motor development. The firing pattern and shape of motor units were studied at higher resolution. EMG activity was closely related to motor behaviour and posture. At P 11, soleus was only phasically active during <b>movements.</b> <b>Tonic</b> EMG activity appeared with age, and by P 16 the activity pattern {{was similar to that}} of the adult. The activity level also increased markedly with age. This was paralleled by a change in hindlimb posture. The development of tonic activity precedes the development of dendrite bundles in the motoneuron pool of the soleus muscle, which does not support the hypothesis that bundle formation is causally related to tonic activity in postural muscles. At young ages, the tonic EMG was characterized by a clear oscillation pattern with a frequency ranging from 7 to 20 Hz, the higher frequencies occurring at older ages. This oscillation disappeared around P 16, which suggests that it is related to functional development of the stretch reflex. Periods of high frequency firing were observed in the EMG; the highest firing frequencies occurred during locomotion. The maximum firing frequency increased steeply to about 80 Hz at P 18. It is suggested that bursts of high frequency firing are related to the development of monoaminergic innervation of the spinal cord. During the first three weeks, motor unit action potentials often showed complex shapes of long duration and considerable spike-to-spike variability. Computer simulation of the summation process of fibre potentials at the electrode showed that the small fibre diameters and high variability in diameter at young ages are major factors with respect to the generation of complex potentials...|$|R

40|$|Monofluoracetato de sódio (MF) foi identificado, por cromatografia, em três das doze plantas que causam morte súbita em bovinos no Brasil, incluindo Palicourea marcgravii, a mais importante desse grupo. Uma lesão considerada típica por alguns autores para intoxicação foi¹ a degeneração hidrópico-vacuolar dos túbulos uriníferos contorcidos distais (DHV). O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar se a ingestão de MF induz sinais clínicos e lesões similares às observadas nos bovinos intoxicados pelas plantas que causam morte súbita. Seis vacas receberam, por via oral, 0, 5 e 1, 0 mg/kg de MF diluídos em 50 mL de água destilada. Clinicamente, os animais apresentaram taquicardia, jugular repleta com pulso venoso positivo, respiração abdominal, ligeira perda de equilíbrio, por vezes cambaleavam, deitavam e apoiavam a cabeça no flanco. Na fase final (agônica), todos os animais caíam em decúbito lateral, esticavam os membros, faziam movimentos de pedalagem, apresentavam opistótono, nistagmo, mugidos e a morte ocorria em 2 - 14 minutos. À necropsia verificaram-se aurículas, jugulares, ázigos e pulmonares moderadamente ingurgitadas. Observaram-se ainda leve a moderado edema da {{subserosa}} nos locais de fixação da vesícula biliar no fígado, além de leve edema entre o duodeno e o pâncreas. O exame histopatológico revelou, em todos os animais, desde leve a acentuada DHV das células epiteliais dos túbulos uriníferos contorcidos distais associada à cariopicnose. Com relação à ultraestrutura, observou-se vacuolização do citoplasma devido ao acúmulo de água. Vacuolização e necrose de coagulação individual ou de grupos de hepatócitos e leve congestão hepática secundários à estase venosa também foram observados. DHV tem sido observada em casos de envenenamento por outras substâncias, porém nestes não está restrita aos túbulos distais e não se observa cariopicnose. Este estudo demonstra que a DHV dos túbulos renais de bovinos pode ser causada pelo envenenamento por MF e, por analogia, essa substância deve ser considerada como um dos fatores importantes, senão o mais significativo, implicado na morte dos animais que ingerem plantas que causam morte súbita no Brasil. Isso indica que estudos, que envolvam metabolização de MF por bactérias ruminais, teriam grande aplicabilidade econômica, uma vez que pelo menos 500. 000 bovinos morrem anualmente intoxicados por plantas do grupo das que causam morte súbita no Brasil. Sodium monofluoroacetate (MF) was identified, by cromatography, {{in three}} of the 12 plants that cause sudden death in cattle in Brazil, including Palicourea marcgravii, the most important plant of this group. A special kind of hydropic-vacuolar degeneration (HVD) of the distal convoluted uriniferous tubules was considered typical for the poisoning by some authors. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify if the ingestion of MF causes similar clinical signs and lesion in cattle poisoned by plants that cause sudden death. Six cows received orally 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg of M diluted in 50 mL of distilled water. Clinically the animals presented tachycardia, engorgement and positive pulse of the jugular vein, abdominal breathing, swaying gait, subtle unbalance, and recumbency with head placed the on the flank. In the agonal phase all the animals in lateral recumbence presented muscular fasciculation, <b>tonic</b> contraction, peddling <b>movements,</b> opisthotonus, nystagmus, and died between 2 and 14 minutes. At postmortem examination, the heart auricles, jugular and pulmonary veins were moderately distended and engorged with blood. Slight to moderate edema of the subserosa was seen around the gall bladder and the duodenum near to the pancreas. At light microscopy, HVD associated with nuclear picnosis of the epithelial cells of the distal convoluted uriniferous tubules was present in all animals. Ultrastructurally, the cell lesion represents formation of cytosolic vacuoles, likely due to accumulation of water. Coagulation necrosis of individual or groups of hepatocytes and slight hepatic congestion secondary to the venous stasis were also observed. Hydropic-vacuolar degeneration has been observed in cases of poisoning by many substances, which cause acute tubular nephrosis, however not restricted to the distal renal tubules and without nuclear picnosis. This study demonstrates that the HVD in the kidney can be caused by MF and, in analogy, the compound should be considered responsible for the death of cattle that ingest toxic plants which cause sudden death in Brazil. Our results can be supportive to studies that will focus on the degradation of MF by rumen bacteria, what might have economic implications, as at least 500. 000 cattle die annually by sudden death causing toxic plants in Brazil...|$|R
