40|$|About the book: This work {{contains}} {{the full text}} of the papers presented at the fourth Tax Law History Conference in July 2008. The Conference was organised by the Cambridge Law Faculty's Centre for Tax Law. The matters discussed are broad and include the extent to which charges levied by the Court of Wards were seen as taxes, the seventeenth century poll tax, <b>traders,</b> the <b>excise</b> and the in early nineteenth century England and the right of the Crown's right to elect between different heads of charge to income tax. There are also chapters on taxation in the reign of King John and Stamp Duties in the 18 th Century. International tax matters include a history of company residence and a paper on the first UK-Australia Double Tax Agreement. Papers concentrating on other countries include papers on the history of income tax in Malta (1641 - 1949), the history of land tax in Australia, the history of the legal definition of charity and its application to tax law and a paper on the psychology of taxation as shown by the 1936 US Election. ...|$|R
5000|$|After Australian Indian Ocean territories were <b>excised,</b> {{increasing}} <b>numbers</b> of {{asylum seekers}} attempted {{to reach the}} Australian mainland by-passing those islands, which are closer to Indonesia. To combat this tactic, on 30 October 2012, the Australian government excised the entire Australian mainland from the Australian migration zone. The legislation to excise the mainland itself from the migration zone was passed by Parliament on 16 May 2013. Before the excise, asylum seekers who reached the mainland by boat could not be sent offshore to Australian immigration detention facilities on Nauru or Papua New Guinea's Manus Island for immigration processing.|$|R

They were distinguished by dark blue uniforms with shakos or round forage caps. Under the Spanish Republic the Carabineros were subordinated to the Finance Department of the Home Ministry, and consisted of customs and <b>excise</b> officials <b>numbering</b> some 15,000 by the Spanish Civil War of 193639. They remained an armed force subject to military discipline. About 8,750 carabineros remained loyal to the Republican Government, providing a core of trained manpower for the Republican forces.

40|$|Currently, laparoscopic {{cystectomy}} is the first-line {{therapy for}} ovarian benign cysts that {{are resistant to}} current therapies. There are different studies that point to ovarian reserve damage due to laparoscopic cystectomy. In this study, we evaluate the ovarian damage following laparoscopic cystectomy for non-endometriosis cysts using ultrasound and pathology findings. This is a prospective cohort study conducted between 7 rd month of 2011 and 10 th month of 2012 in Women hospital affiliated to Tehran university of medical sciences. 45 non-endometriosis cysts (17 teratoma, 7 mucinous, 10 simple serous and 11 simple cysts) underwent laparoscopic cystectomy with stripping technique. Amount of <b>excised</b> parenchyma, <b>number</b> of lost oocytes and cyst wall fibrosis thickness were histopathologically studied. Before and 3 months after surgery antral follicle count was evaluated by ultrasound. AFC after cystectomy for teratoma and simple serous was significantly reduced P< 0. 05. By larger teratomas and more parenchyma inadvertently removed during their excision (1. 64, 0. 255) reduced AFC was seen and in simple serous cysts with more removed parenchyma amount (1. 5) reduced AFC occurred. In our study simple cysts excision led to a loss in AFC that {{was not associated with}} any other cyst parameters. Mucinous cysts resection led to no specific ovarian reserve damage. Laparoscopic cystectomy for non-endometriosis leads to reduced ovarian reserve...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy (SLNB) with a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) tracer was shown to be non-inferior to the {{standard}} combined technique in the SentiMAG Multicentre Trial. The MRI subprotocol of this trial aimed to develop a magnetic alternative for pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy (LS). We evaluated the feasibility of using MRI following the administration of magnetic tracer for pre-operative localization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and its potential for non-invasive identification of lymph node (LN) metastases. Methods: Patients with breast cancer scheduled to undergo SLNB were recruited for pre-operative LS, single photon emission CT (SPECT) -CT and SPIO MRI. T 1 weighted turbo spin echo and T 2 weighted gradient echo sequences were used before and after interstitial injection of magnetic tracer into the breast. SLNs on MRI were defined as LNs with signal drop and direct lymphatic drainage from the injection site. LNs showing inhomogeneous SPIO uptake were classified as metastatic. During surgery, a handheld magnetometer was used for SLNB. Blue or radioactive nodes were also <b>excised.</b> The <b>number</b> of SLNs and MR assessment of metastatic involvement were compared with surgical and histological outcomes. Results: 11 patients were recruited. SPIO MRI successfully identified SLNs in 10 of 11 patients vs 11 of 11 patients with LS/SPECT-CT. One patient had metastatic involvement of four LNs, and this was identified in one node on pre-operative MRI. Conclusion: SPIO MRI is a feasible technique for pre-operative localization of SLNs and, in combination with intraoperative use of a handheld magnetometer, provides an entirely radioisotope-free technique for SLNB. Further research is needed {{for the evaluation of}} MRI characterization of LN involvement using subcutaneous injection of magnetic tracer. Advances in knowledge: This study is the first to demonstrate that an interstitially administered magnetic tracer can be used both for pre-operative imaging and intraoperative SLNB, with equal performance to imaging and localization with radioisotope...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{define the}} clinical, {{angiographic}} and procedural correlates of quantitative coronary dimensions after directional coronary atherectomy, 400 lesions in 378 patients were analyzed {{with use of}} qualitative morphologic and quantitative angiographic methods. Successful atherectomy, defined by a < 75 % residual area stenosis, tissue retrieval {{and the absence of}} in-hospital ischemic complications, was performed in 351 lesions (87. 7 %). After atherectomy, minimal cross-sectional area increased from 1. 2 ± 1. 1 to 6. 6 ± 4. 4 mm 2 (p < 0. 001) and percent area stenosis was reduced from 87 ± 10 % to 31 ± 42 % (p < 0. 001). By univariate analysis, device size (p < 0. 001) and left circumflex artery lesion location (p = 0. 004) were associated with a larger final minimal cross-sectional area. Conversely, restenotic lesion (p = 0. 002), lesion length ≥ 10 mm (p = 0. 018) and lesion calcification (p = 0. 035) were quantitatively associated with a smaller final minimum cross-sectional area. With use of stepwise multivariate analysis to control for the reference area, atherectomy device size (p = 0. 003) and left circumflex lesion location (p = 0. 007) were independently associated with a larger final minimal cross-sectional area, whereas restenotic lesion (p = 0. 010), diffuse proximal disease (p = 0. 033), lesion length ≥ 10 mm (p = 0. 026) and lesion calcification (p = 0. 081) were significantly correlated with a smaller final minimal cross-sectional area. The <b>number</b> of specimens <b>excised,</b> the <b>number</b> of atherectomy passes and atherectomy balloon inflation pressure did not correlate with the final minimal cross-sectional area. Thus, directional atherectomy results in marked improvement of coronary lumen dimensions, at least in part correlated with the presence of certain clinical, angiographic and procedural factors at the time of atherectomy...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} taxes called excise duties are imposed on tobacco {{products in the}} Czech Republic {{and also in the}} other European Union countries. Cigarette taxation is atypical compared to taxation of other products encumbered with <b>excise</b> duty. <b>Number</b> of cigarettes and also consumer’s price together make the tax base. Harmonization effort of cigarette taxes in the European Union countries and also pure fiscal need of Czech Republic, are causes of frequent changes of cigarette taxes rates in recent years. These changes does not conduce only to changes of tax collection, but also bring many other effects, that have to be identified and analysed to set global results of steps {{to be made in the}} scope of tax policy in the Czech Republic. Average price of all 435 cigarettes marks on the market in the period from July 2001 to July 2009 is the base characteristic necessary to examine impacts of cigarette taxes changes. Classical regression analysis is used to analyse legislative changes impact on average cigarettes price. Single legislative changes are realized through the use of synthetic (dummy) variables performing as explanatory variables. There is also tested significance of particular parameters of the model and analysed structural breakages in this text. It is necessary not only to impeach lawful impact of these steps during imposing or changing of taxation, but also effective impact, which is often very different from lawful impact. From implementation of obligatory of marking the cigarettes in 2001 we are able to identify some relevant characteristics and impacts of changes of tax burden imposed on cigarettes in the Czech Republic. Statistically significant changes of average non-weighted price of cigarettes are identified in here, as well as structural breakages of average non-weighted price of cigarettes and values of tax incidence. Also temporal and other connection with given facts is discussed...|$|R

The present study reports the use of in vitro propagation and genetic characterization as an effective strategy for conservation of this rare species. The developed system relied on multiple shoot organogenesis from explants <b>excised</b> from few <b>number</b> of aseptically growing seedlings. A maximum shoot production (150 shoot per single explants) was achieved on Murashige and Skoog’s medium (MS) supplemented with 4. 5 benzyl adenine (BA), 0. 5 g/l casein and 0. 5 mg/l silver nitrate. The obtained results also indicated that a regeneration medium contained 4 mg/l BA; 0. 4 mg/l NAA; 0. 2 mg/l GA 3; 200 mg/l adenine sulfate; 0. 5 mg/l silver nitrate; 0. 5 g/l casein and 100 mg/l myoinositol favored rooting of the proliferated shoots. In order to devise an appropriate tissue culture media type and regime for true-to-type plantlets, genetic analysis of tissue culture-derived plantlets (vitroplants) was studied using RAPD–PCR analysis and morphological descriptions of vitroplants (tissue culture-derived plantlets) produced on different regeneration media. The results of the molecular analysis using RAPD–PCR indicated that optimization of in vitro culture system based on tissue culture criteria must be coupled by simple, cheap and reproducible method {{for the detection of}} genetic stability at the DNA level vitroplants...|$|R

Customs supervision and service office has role in controlling and analyzing thecountry acceptance potency because there are still many violation happening aroundthe customs supervision and service office. This research is aimed to understand the kind of effort that can be done bycustoms supervision and service office in controlling the excise wisdoms, role andfunction of customs supervision and service office and the obstacle that may beexperienced by customs supervision and service office in the implementation ofmonitoring of the excise wisdom. Research methods used is descriptive qualitative. The primary data sources were taken from interview, information from document,archives, and other relevant source to this research. Result of the research show that customs supervision and service office medium type of Kudus 2 ̆ 7 excise has efforts in monitoring and giving service to the service users through the preventive effort in form of administration monitoring and socializing to the service users and societies that involve in the cigarette industries. Repressive effort is one way to save the country disadvantage and decrease the excise violation. The repressive effort is being done by the physical monitoring and examination to the companies, regular market checking, and treating the violation with criminal and administration sanctions. The suggested recommendation is to increase the monitoring ability within the five working areas of customs supervision and service office of medium type Kudus 2 ̆ 7 excise by optimizing more performance of customs supervision and service office of medium type Kudus 2 ̆ 7 excise workers cooperate with local government and give the appeal to society about the danger it may cause because of violation in the cigarette production activities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Rectal tumors can be <b>excised</b> {{through a}} <b>number</b> of {{minimally}} invasive transanal techniques including transanal excision, transanal endoscopic micro-surgery, and transanal {{minimally invasive surgery}} (TAMIS). Specialty training is often required to master the nuances of these approaches. This study aimed to create a reproducible transanal excision training model that is suited for laparoendoscopic techniques. Methods: Frozen porcine rectum and anus with intact perianal skin were commercially obtained. Thawed spec-imens were then cut to approximately 20 cm in length. The proximal end of the rectum was then everted and suction applied to the mucosa to create pseudopolyps of various sizes (sessile and pedunculated). Larger peduncu-lated lesions were made by tying {{the base of the}} pseudopo-lyps with 5 – 0 monofilament sutures to gather more tissue. Methylene blue dye was injected submucosally into the le-sions to simulate tattoos. The proximal rectum was then closed with sutures. The model was suspended in a trainer box by clamping the distal end in a ringed clamp and the proximal end to the box. Transanal excisions using TAMIS were then performed. The procedures were done by trained community colorectal surgeons attending courses on transanal minimally invasive surgery. Results: Both partial- and full-thickness excisions of ses-sile and pedunculated rectal lesions were successfully performed during simulated TAMIS by trained community surgeons learning this laparoendoscopic technique. Conclusion: Transanal laparoendoscopic procedures to excise rectal tumors can be successfully and reproducibly performed in an ex vivo porcine anorectal model.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the workload profile {{in a network}} of Australian skin cancer clinics. Design and setting: Analysis of billing data for the first 6 months of 2005 in a primary-care skin cancer clinic network, consisting of seven clinics and staffed by 20 doctors, located in the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. Main outcome measures: Consultation to biopsy ratio (CBR); biopsy to treatment ratio (BTR); number of benign naevi <b>excised</b> per melanoma (<b>number</b> needed to treat [NNT]). Results: Of 69780 billed activities, 34 622 (49. 6 %) were consultations, 19 358 (27. 7 %) biopsies, 8055 (11. 5 %) surgical excisions, 2804 (4. 0 %) additional surgical repairs, 1613 (2. 3 %) non-surgical treatments of cancers and 3328 (4. 8 %) treatments of premalignant or non-malignant lesions. A total of 6438 cancers were treated (116 melanomas by excision, 4709 non-melanoma skin cancers [NMSCs] by excision, and 1613 NMSCs non-surgically); 5251 (65. 2 %) surgical wounds were repaired by direct suture, 2651 (32. 9 %) by a flap (of which 44. 8 % were simple flaps), 42 (0. 5 %) by wedge excision and 111 (1. 4 %) by grafts. The CBR was 1. 79, the BTR was 3. 1 and the NNT was 28. 6.

The estimated NNT {{was similar to that}} reported previously in general practice. More data are needed on health outcomes, including effectiveness of treatment and surgical repair. 3 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that a}} conjugate (MA-ce 6) between maleylated serum albumin and the photosensitizer chlorin(e 6) (ce 6) is targeted in vitro to macrophages via class A scavenger receptors. We now report {{on the ability of}} this conjugate to localize in macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Both the conjugate and the free photosensitizer ce 6 are studied after injection into New Zealand White rabbits that are rendered atherosclerotic by a combination of aortic endothelial injury and cholesterol feeding into normal rabbits. Rabbits are sacrificed at 6 and 24 h after injection and intravascular fluorescence spectroscopy is carried out by fiber-based fluorimetry in intact blood-filled arteries. Surface spectrofluorimetry of <b>numbered</b> <b>excised</b> aortic segments together with injured and normal iliac arteries is carried out, and quantified ce 6 content by subsequent extraction and quantitative fluorescence determination of the arterial segments and also of nontarget organs. There is good agreement between the various techniques for quantifying ce 6 localization, and high contrast between arteries from atherosclerotic and normal rabbits is obtained. Fluorescence correlates with the highest burden of plaque in the aorta and the injured iliac artery. The highest accumulation in plaques is obtained using MA-ce 6 at 24 h. Free ce 6 gives better accumulation at 6 h compared to 24 h. The liver, spleen, lung, and gall bladder have the highest uptake in nontarget organs. Macrophage-targeted photosensitizer conjugates may have applications in both detecting and treating inflamed vulnerable plaque.
