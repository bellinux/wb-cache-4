50|$|The 110 BA {{also comes}} stock with a Heckler & Koch PSG1 style pistol grip. The grip is a target-type grip which {{contains}} an adjustable palm shelf.

Loosening the bolt allows for the palm rest to {{move up and down}} to accommodate the shooters hand size. <b>Tightening</b> <b>the</b> bolt <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> rest into a set position that is now customized to the shooters hand size.|$|R
5000|$|As {{long as the}} {{clove hitch}} can feed over the drum, the rope will feed through the device. In a fall, the drum is back driven by the rope as the device slides down the rope; when the drum {{rotation}} exceeds a certain angular velocity, it <b>locks</b> off to <b>the</b> frame {{and the increase in}} friction induced between the stationary drum and the rope causes the clove hitch to rapidly <b>tighten</b> around <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> drum to arrest the fall.|$|R

50|$|A ballhead uses a {{ball and}} socket type joint for {{orientation}} control. The ball sits in a socket, which can be <b>tightened</b> to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> ball in place. A stem extends from the ball which terminates at the head mount. They tend to have fewer parts than other types of tripod heads due to their simple mechanism, but the parts must be precisely machined to fit well together and provide smooth movement, increasing their average price. Ballheads offer the convenience of simple controls, but are lacking in terms of precise movements, making specific alignment and image positioning a challenge.|$|R

50|$|Handcuffs {{with double}} locks have a detent which when engaged stops the cuff from {{ratcheting}} tighter to prevent <b>the</b> wearer from <b>tightening</b> them. Tightening could be intentional or by struggling; if <b>tightened,</b> <b>the</b> handcuffs may cause nerve damage {{or loss of}} circulation. Also some wearers could <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> cuffs to attempt an escape by having the officer loosen the cuffs and attempting to escape while the cuffs are loose. Double locks also make picking <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> more difficult.|$|R

5000|$|Recently, {{a device}} called [...] "The Buster" [...] has been {{designed}} for locksmiths. It is a big screw with a hook on one end and a large handle on the other and two legs designed to rest on <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> It breaks steering wheel <b>locks</b> such as <b>the</b> Club by hooking onto <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> screw with the handle. The large handle provides mechanical advantage, concentrating the force applied by the hook and eventually forcing <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> to fold in half or snap in two.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{present in}} vitro study was {{designed}} to compare the differences in the vertical misfit of implant-supported frameworks using three different forces for <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> bridge <b>locking</b> screws: fastening by hand until first resistance, and using torque drivers with 10 and 20 Ncm. METHODS: The investigation was conducted based on the results given by 9 six-unit nickel-chromium (2 abutments/ 4 pontics) screw-retained implant-supported frameworks. The structures were exposed to simulated porcelain firings. The marginal misfit measurements were made using a traveling measuring microscope at selected screw tightening forces: fastening by hand until first resistance, and using torque drivers with 10 and 20 Ncm. The results were submitted to one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor, and post hoc pairwise comparisons using Tukey test (5 %). RESULTS: The mean marginal misfit of the frameworks, fastening the screws by hand until first resistance, was 41. 56 µm (SD± 12. 45 µm). The use of torque driver devices caused a significant reduction in marginal opening (p< 0. 05). With the lowest torque available (10 Ncm), the mean marginal discrepancy at the abutment-framework interface was reduced an average of 52 % to a mean marginal opening of 19. 71 µm (SD± 2. 97 µm). After the use of the 20 Ncm torque driver, the mean marginal discrepancy of the frameworks was reduced an average of 69 % to a mean marginal opening of 12. 82 µm (SD± 4. 0 µm). Comparing the use of torque drivers with 10 and 20 Ncm torque, the means are not significantly different from one another. CONCLUSION: The seating force has an important effect on the vertical misfit measurements, once it may considerably narrow the vertical misfit gaps at the abutment-framework interface, thus leading to a misjudgment of the real marginal situation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self <b>tightening.</b> <b>The</b> wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> nut to <b>tighten</b> and hold <b>the</b> wheel securely.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} tides raised by Saturn on its co-orbital satellites Janus and Epimetheus, and its consequences on the long-term evolution of the co-orbital horseshoe pattern of those moons. This tidal effect is found to produce a loosening of <b>the</b> co-orbital <b>lock</b> of Janus and Epimetheus. The increase of the difference D between their semi-major axes under this process is estimated as 2. 77 km/Myear, {{regardless of whether the}} moons are composed of monolithic or fractured ice. On the other hand, assuming that the outer edge of Saturn's A ring is permanently maintained by Janus and Epimetheus at their 7 : 6 resonance, Lissauer et al. (1985) have shown that the torques exerted on Janus and Epimetheus due to resonances with Saturn's rings would produce a <b>tightening</b> of <b>the</b> co-orbital <b>lock.</b> <b>The</b> rate of decrease of orbital difference D under that latter process depends upon the precise relative radial location of the A-ring outer edge as compared with Janus' lower orbit semi-major axis, which is quantified here by means of a parameter po characterizing the efficiency of the effect of Janus' ring resonance. Under the combined effects of those two processes, depending on the value of po relative to a critical value po≈ 19 %, the system will evolve toward either a transition from horseshoe to tadpole orbit, or to a destruction of <b>the</b> co-orbital <b>lock,</b> after a few tens of Myears. Most recent observations of the A ring's outer edge by Spitale and Porco (2009) tend to indicate that the future evolution will be a net <b>tightening</b> of <b>the</b> co-orbital system as proposed by Lissauer et al. (1985), until a tadpole situation will be reached after about 15 Myears. From a study of the past history of the co-orbital system, it is shown that such a scenario is compatible with a capture from free orbits to co-orbital horseshoe pattern some 25 Myears ago...|$|R

2500|$|Speedcuffs {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} ratchet handcuffs {{connected by a}} rigid metal bar, which is enclosed in a plastic grip secured with bolts. Removal of the grip offers no advantage to escape, as it is only present to facilitate the comfortable manipulation of the cuffs by the arresting officer. Weighing 390 g (13.75 oz) and with a maximum dilation of 23.2 cm (9.13 inches), the speedcuffs are slightly larger than the chain-linked and hinged handcuffs previously manufactured by Hiatts, and accommodate a greater range of wrist sizes. They feature Hiatt's 'back loading' feature, which allows the ratchet to be pulled backwards for a few [...] "clicks" [...] through <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> casing to set the cuffs in the ideal position for quick application. <b>The</b> <b>locks</b> accept a standard handcuff key, and have a double locking facility which is activated through a small pin {{on the back of}} the cuff. <b>The</b> double <b>locking</b> facility must be depressed with a pointed object, such as the protrusion found on the top of the handcuff key; double locking prevents accidentally or knowingly <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> cuff once it has been locked, helping to prevent paralysis or other injury.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{critical}} to avoid over-tightening the nut or else {{the integrity of the}} compression fitting will be compromised by the excessive force.

A good rule of thumb is to <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> nut first by hand until it is too difficult to continue and then <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> nut one half-turn more with the aid of a wrench; the actual amount varies with the size of the fitting, as a larger one requires less <b>tightening.</b> <b>The</b> fitting is then tested: if slight weeping is observed, the fitting is gradually <b>tightened</b> until <b>the</b> weeping stops.|$|R
