5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. <b>These</b> <b>methods</b> provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E
