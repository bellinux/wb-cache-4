He won the 100m in 10.21seconds, beating the {{defending}} NCAA champions DaBryan Blanton and Tyson Gay to the title. After recording a personal best of 20.18seconds in the semifinals, he managed a fourth-place finish in the 200m race.

60|$|The master then scolded him soundly {{about the}} stolen robe, but in vain Labakan {{told him he}} had come to pay for it and offered three times its price. They only fell <b>to</b> <b>beating</b> <b>him</b> again, and at last pushed {{him out of the house}} more dead than alive.|$|R
50|$|Graham's semi-final {{was another}} {{excellent}} game. Tom Hargreaves came close <b>to</b> <b>beating</b> <b>him,</b> but when Graham offered CLEARINGS and Tom offered RESCALING, Tom's word was ruled invalid which gave Graham an extra 18 points. Indeed, Graham {{went on to}} win by 21 points, setting up a final with Series 47 unbeaten champion Chris Wills.|$|R

In {{the start of}} the match, Batista fought both Goldust and Vader, where they {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> down in the corner. However, Batista fought back with a series of Spears. Coachman, who stood on the outside, entered the ring, but didn't last long, as Batista clotheslined him. Batista attempted to suplex Vader but Goldust managed to hit Batista with a kendo stick, allowing Coachman to receive the advantage over Batista.

After his performance, school bullies attempt <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> up, and he runs away. Bart attempts to escape by jumping a trench, but fails to make it and takes a nasty fall. The bullies leave, while Lisa tells Bart how proud she is of him, that they are now kindred spirits.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} in Belgium with Gent, Mido signed a five-year {{contract}} with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001. He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol, after colliding with a defender. He made his return for the team against Heerenveen, a match which Ajax lost 5–1. However, he was sent off against Twente, after kicking Spira Grujić whilst trying <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> to the ball, {{for which he was}} later given a three-match ban. He returned for Ajax against Vitesse, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute. He failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002, which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman, and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo. Mido scored in Ajax's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final, meaning he ended the 2001–02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double.|$|E

5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|At the Masters on 12 January, Stephen Maguire {{edged out}} O'Sullivan {{in a final}} frame to win their first-round match at Wembley. In a battle of the top two players in the {{provisional}} world rankings, O'Sullivan fought back from 1–4 down to level at 5–5 and take the match into a deciding eleventh frame. O'Sullivan missed the final blue with the rest, when poised to win the match, allowing Maguire to reach the quarter-finals. After withdrawing from the invitational Malta Cup, O'Sullivan returned at the Welsh Open in February. Playing a good tournament, he reached the final. Although he led 8–5, Selby won the last four frames <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> 9–8. O'Sullivan {{was present at the}} China Open, in Beijing, where he lost 4–5 to Marco Fu in the first round. However, at the press conference, which followed the match, O'Sullivan was heard making some lewd remarks inviting a member of the press to perform fellatio on him, then laughing with the World Snooker media spokesman. O'Sullivan also joked about the size and girth of his penis, before simulating a sexual act on his microphone. In June 2008, the WPBSA punished him for his behaviour by docking the appearance money and world-ranking points that he had earned from the event.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2005, Cotto {{faced the}} last man <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> as an amateur, former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Mohamed Abdulaev from Uzbekistan. As amateurs, Abdulaev eliminated Cotto from {{the first round of}} the 2000 Sydney Olympics. This time they met as professionals in New York City's Madison Square Garden. Before the beginning of the fight Cotto received a positive ovation from the public. During the first round Miguel went on the offensive scoring hits on Abdullaev's head and body while he was in a defensive stance. In the fourth round a left hook by Miguel hurt Abdullaev, who proceeded to focus his hits on Cotto's body. Abdullaev's offense was effective in the sixth and seventh rounds and as a result of this Cotto assumed a defensive stance. Following the eighth round Abdullaev's eye was swollen to the point of being almost entirely closed. In the ninth round following accurate punches by Cotto the fight's referee paused the fight and asked the ringside doctor to examine Abdullaev's eye. After being examined by the doctor Abdullaev indicated to the referee that he could not continue, this way Cotto retained the Welterweight division championship.|$|E
50|$|Horace Lindrum (born Horace Norman William Morrell, 15 January 1912 - 20 June 1974) was an Australian {{professional}} snooker and billiards player. Although {{the dominant}} snooker player in Australia, he was eclipsed by Joe Davis, whom he never beat on level terms. Lindrum contested three World Championship finals against Davis, in 1936, 1937 and 1946, losing all three but coming closer than anyone <b>to</b> <b>beating</b> <b>him.</b> When past his best, Lindrum won the 1952 World Championship which, {{because of a}} dispute between the governing body and the players' association, was only contested by himself and New Zealander Clark McConachy.|$|R

500|$|The 100m at the DN Galan {{meeting in}} Stockholm saw Gay's first match-up {{of the year}} against Bolt. He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, <b>beating</b> <b>him</b> with 9.84 <b>to</b> Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Usain but deep down inside I know he is not 100%. I look forward <b>to</b> <b>beating</b> <b>him</b> when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|R
25|$|Is {{he going}} to throw it away? Is he going <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> <b>him</b> with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|The re–run began, with Palatinus again {{getting away}} first, however {{at the first}} corner, Mick pursued him around the first corner alone.

When villagers in his home town of Killeigh heard of his success, an impromptu bonfire party was held.|$|E
25|$|Sampras' ranking {{was hurt}} through a {{combination}} of withdrawing from the Australian and US Opens, tournaments in which he had strong performances during the previous year, and the resurgence of longtime rival Agassi, putting an end to Sampras' six consecutive years of finishing as world number 1.
