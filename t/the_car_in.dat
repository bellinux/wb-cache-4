5|$|After {{the police}} leave, Cheenu comes running after <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> which Viji is travelling. He follows {{them to the}} railway station and tries to gain the {{attention}} of Viji, but she is unable to recognise him. Cheenu acts like a dancing monkey that Viji developed a liking for, but Viji, unable to comprehend, thinks that he is insane and begging for food. Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him. Cheenu, who was injured while chasing her car {{and trying to get}} her attention, is left alone, heartbroken.|$|E

5|$|Carl Eric Wickman {{was born}} in Sweden in 1887. In 1905 {{he moved to the}} United States where he was working in a mine as a drill {{operator}} in Alice, Minnesota, until he was laid off in 1914. In the same year, he became a Hupmobile salesman in Hibbing, Minnesota. He proved unable to sell <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>In</b> 1914, using his remaining vehicle, a 7-passenger car, he began a bus service with Andy (Bus Andy) Anderson and C.A.A. (Arvid) Heed, by transporting iron ore miners from Hibbing to Alice (known for its saloons) at 15 cents a ride.|$|E
5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> order to save Audrey. David used the accident {{as an excuse to}} quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of April 19, 2013, while in Atlanta, Georgia filming The Good Lie, Witherspoon and Toth were pulled over after <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> which they were {{traveling}} was seen weaving across a double line on Peachtree Street. Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if he knew who she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E

5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required to sit in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate {{the impact of the}} crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit punch in <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E
5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. The car featured heavy revisions to the team's previous cars and looked very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or {{come close to the}} World Title.

5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> which Baba {{was being}} driven {{went out of}} control and a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from that point on he was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{had hoped}} {{to be given the}} {{contract}} to produce the Tiger in America, but Rootes was somewhat uneasy about the closeness of his relationship with Ford, so it was decided to build <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> England. The Rootes factory at Ryton did not have the capacity to build the Tiger, so the company contracted the job to Jensen in West Bromwich. Any disappointment Shelby may have felt was tempered by an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built.|$|E
5|$|The clip commences with {{a police}} car {{arriving}} at the heating power plant, followed by Stan lying on a bed surrounded by surveillance cameras, sporting black lingerie. She is then introduced wearing a black hat and white shirt with a tie, while a crowd {{of male and female}} dancers perform a synchronized choreography. Following this, Stan makes an appearance wearing a white dress, and {{a police car}} is shown arriving. Subsequently, two policemen get out of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> order to search for Stan. However, they do not find her in the bed and the video ends with Stan leaving the building and the men watching material recorded by the surveillance cameras.|$|E

5|$|Troop {{hospital}} cars, {{also based}} on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Each had 38 berths for patients, 30 of which were arranged in the central section of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> three tiers on each side. There was also a section with six berths {{which could be used}} for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases. Each unit was ice air-conditioned and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> front of it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the Sprint Cup Series for one race in Penske's No. 12: the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway. Starting in 10th place, he led for seven laps and finished 19th (one lap behind). Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due to the driver change Hornish had {{to move to the}} rear of the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of repair time. Hornish drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> the remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places at Atlanta, Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E
