5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus {{has a more}} pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{can begin}} to {{manifest}} at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120minutes thereafter.

5|$|The terms C {{movie and}} <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> Z movie {{describe}} progressively lower grades of the B movie category.

5|$|The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa is {{distinguished}} from <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> variety by the orange {{color of the}} upper branches. Variety compactospora tends to show a more pronounced wine-red, purple, or reddish color in the branch tips, and has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4µm.|$|E

5|$|All Silkies {{have black}} or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their Chinese {{language}} name is wu gu ji (烏骨雞), meaning 'black-boned chicken'. Melanism which {{extends beyond the}} skin into an animal's connective tissue is a rare trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation. Disregarding color, the breed does not generally produce as much as <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> meat breeds of chicken.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{comprehensive}} schools in Hong Kong fall under three categories: the rarer public schools; <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> subsidised schools, including government aids-and-grant schools; and private schools, often run by Christian organisations and having admissions based on academic merit {{rather than on}} financial resources. Outside this system are the schools under the Direct Subsidy Scheme and private international schools.|$|E

5|$|On 11 July 2011, Neptune {{completed}} its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, {{although it did}} not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because of {{the motion of the}} Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the variety}} of harmful uses of poisons {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel. In the modern world, intentional poisoning is less common than the Middle Ages. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> concern is the risk of accidental poisoning from everyday substances and products.|$|E
5|$|Planning of {{a railway}} to connect Trøndelag and Jämtland, Sweden, started in 1869, {{with one of}} the {{proposals}} being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden. However, surveys along the Verdal alternative deemed it unsuitable, and instead the line was built via Stjørdalen and Meråker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with standard gauge instead of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> narrow gauge. The Meråker Line opened on 22 July 1882.|$|E

5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common snipe, pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has {{been joined by}} little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|The Lancian time {{interval}} {{was the last}} interval before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that eliminated non-avian dinosaurs. Edmontosaurus was one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> dinosaurs of the interval. Robert Bakker reports that it made up one-seventh of the large dinosaur sample, {{with most of the}} rest (five-sixths) made up of the horned dinosaur Triceratops. The coastal plain Triceratops–Edmontosaurus association, dominated by Triceratops, extended from Colorado to Saskatchewan.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} by decomposing and digesting organic matter—and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well-decayed wood. It typically fruits {{in a narrow}} window from June to July; this {{spring and early summer}} fruiting distinguishes it from <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> Coprinus comatus and Coprinopsis atramentaria, which produce fruit bodies in late autumn. It is found in the United States, in areas east of the Great Plains.|$|E

5|$|This genus {{of dinosaurs}} lived {{in what is}} now mid-western North America {{at the end of the}} Jurassic period. Diplodocus is one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> dinosaur fossils found in the middle to upper Morrison Formation, between about 154 and 152 million years ago, during the late Kimmeridgian age. The Morrison Formation records an {{environment}} and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Camarasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Along the {{southern}} {{shores of the}} peninsula, and within the river delta, exist a range of bird and marine life. Many of these species are endangered, {{which was one of}} the primary factors considered when placing the delta under national protection. Some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> bird species observed here include pygmy cormorants (Microcarbo pygmeus), little egrets (Egretta garzetta), lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni), Kentish plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla), and the Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), for which the park is a key nesting place. Marine life consists of species typical of the Aegean Sea, as well as some species usually found elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from those}} few {{individuals}} kept in zoos and pictured in books, the Sumatran rhinoceros has remained little known, overshadowed by <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> Indian, {{black and white}} rhinos. Recently, however, video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries. Extensive footage {{can be found in}} an Asia Geographic documentary The Littlest Rhino. Natural History New Zealand showed footage of a Sumatran rhino, shot by freelance Indonesian-based cameraman Alain Compost, in the 2001 documentary The Forgotten Rhino, which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos.|$|E
