50|$|Among <b>the</b> integers, <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> {{correspond}} one-for-one {{with the}} non-negative integers: in this ring, every ideal {{is a principal}} <b>ideal</b> consisting of <b>the</b> multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> may be distinct from the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> than to <b>the</b> elements of the ring. For instance, <b>the</b> prime <b>ideals</b> of a ring are analogous to prime numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to ideals.

5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> generated by a and b is <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E
