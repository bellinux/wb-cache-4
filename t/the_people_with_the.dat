5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

When a bishop is serving the Liturgy, the concelebrating priests will hold the Aër during the Creed as the bishop kneels (or bows his head) underneath it.

25|$|Though one of {{the most}} {{politically}} experienced of Sinn Féin's TDs, Cosgrave was not among the major leadership of the party. Nevertheless, after Cathal Brugha, the first President of Dáil Éireann, resigned and Éamon de Valera, who with the help of Michael Collins had just escaped from prison with a key made from a candle, took over, he was appointed to de Valera's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, his close friendship with de Valera being {{one of the}} reasons he was chosen. Another reason was his long experience on Dublin Corporation, most recently as Chairman of its Finance Committee. His chief task as minister was the job of organising the non-cooperation of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British authorities and establishing an alternative system of government.

When Athellion left for the war, Vetch bribed a council member to infect <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> virus, so they became his slaves. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the Wise Man directs Haven to a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. Haven reaches the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra, and rescuing Chess.|$|E

2500|$|The Germanic {{language}} which diutisc {{most likely}} comes from is West Frankish, a language which died {{out a long}} time ago and which there is hardly any written evidence for today. This was the Germanic dialect used in the early Middle Ages, spoken by the Franks in Western Francia, i.e. in the region which is now northern France. The word is only known from the Latin form theodiscus. Until the 8th century the Franks called their language frengisk; however, when the Franks moved their political and cultural centre to the area where France now is, the term frengisk became ambiguous, as in the West Francian territory some Franks spoke Latin, some vulgar Latin and some theodisc. For this reason a new word was needed to help differentiate between them. Thus the word theodisc evolved from the Germanic word theoda (<b>the</b> <b>people)</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Latin suffix -iscus, to mean [...] "belonging to the people", i.e. the people's language.|$|E

The Encyclopédie was {{only the first step}} in philosophizing mankind and was necessary to spread the impious and anti-monarchical writings.

Barruel {{believed that the}} conspirators attempt to [...] "imbue the minds of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spirit of insurrection and revolt" [...] and to promote radicalism within all members of society. This was believed to be the main reason behind the Encyclopédie as it was [...] "a vast emporium of all the sophisms, errors, or calumnies which had ever been invented against religion". It contained [...] "the most profligate and impious productions of Voltaire, Diderot, Boulanger, La Mettrie, and of other Deists or Atheists of the age, and this under the specious pretence of enlightening ignorance". Barruel believed the volumes of the Encyclopédie were valuable in controlling the minds of intellectuals and in creating a public opinion against Christianity and monarchy.|$|E
2500|$|Gold {{discoveries in}} Otago (1861) and Westland (1865), caused a {{worldwide}} gold rush {{that more than}} doubled the population from 71,000 in 1859 to 164,000 in 1863. Between 1864 and 1865, under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, 13 ships carrying citizens of England, Ireland and South Africa arrived to New Zealand under the Waikato Immigration Scheme. In the 1870s and 1880s, several thousand Chinese men, mostly from Guangdong province, migrated to New Zealand {{to work on the}} South Island goldfields. Although the first Chinese migrants had been invited by the Otago Provincial government they quickly became the target of hostility from settlers and laws were enacted specifically to discourage them from coming to New Zealand thereafter. The European population of New Zealand grew explosively from fewer than 1000 in 1831 to 500,000 by 1881. By 1911 the number of European settlers had reached a million. This colourful history of unofficial and official settlement of peoples from all over Europe, Australia, South Africa, and Asia and the intermingling of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> indigenous Māori brought about what would eventually evolve into a [...] "New Zealand accent" [...] and a unique regional English lexicon.|$|E
2500|$|Following the war, Owain the Red (now Owain II) and Llywelyn divided upper Gwynedd {{between them}} in {{accordance}} with Welsh custom. Though the division of commotes {{was more or less}} equal, the value of each was weighted in favor of Owain II, whose share included important fertile farming regions on Ynys Môn and the Llyn peninsula, and the historic Aberffraw family seat. Llywelyn was apportioned Arfon, which included the Episcopal seat of Bangor, and west bank of the Conwy river valley then known as Arllechwedd and Nant Conwy, but two other of his holdings were desperately far from his center of power. The status que held until the summer 1255 when the relationship between the brothers deteriorated precipitously, probably over apportioning some of Llywelyn's land to their younger brother Dafydd. [...] Owain II had previously granted Cymydmaen to Dafydd when he came of age in 1252 and demanded that Llywelyn, as the junior brother, also carve land out of his holdings for Dafydd, to which Llywelyn refused. Owain II and Dafydd gathered a host to force the issue, and led their armies through the mountain pass of Bryn Derwin. Waiting for them in the pass, Llywelyn [...] pounced upon his brothers and in the space of an hour inflicted such a defeat that he took both of his brothers prisoners, and thereby becoming master over the whole of upper Gwynedd. With Llywelyn’s victory he effectively usurped Owain II, who was now imprisoned in Dolbadarn Castle. Owain II remained popular with <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bards protesting against his imprisonment.
