5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic Judaism {{was based}} on {{vigorous}} and often contentious debate {{over the meaning of}} the Torah and other sacred texts. One challenge facing the rabbis was to establish the degree of heterodoxy that was acceptable in debate. In this context, Elisha the heretic and Eleazar, who is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> the Torah, represent two extremes in attitudes towards the Torah; actual rabbis and their arguments had to fit somewhere between these two limits.|$|E
25|$|The eight finalists {{made their}} first {{appearance}} on WWE programming on Raw on July 10. The Diva Search had an awkward beginning on July 10 with an introductory segment on Raw featuring new host Mike Mizanin. During the segment, Mizanin appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> his lines and stammered {{on for several}} minutes when trying to explain the voting procedures for the contest. When introducing the contestants, Mizanin mispronounced names and looked uncomfortable in his new role as Diva Search emcee. Each week, the contestants appeared on both Raw and SmackDown!. The final three appeared on a special that aired on August 16, 2006 on the USA Network, where the winner was announced.|$|E
500|$|William Plomer, {{writing in}} The Spectator after the book's first publication, thought it mistaken [...] "to regard Mr Waugh's more {{surprising}} situations as farcical or far-fetched; {{they are on}} the whole extremely realistic". However, the mixture of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's initial thought was that Waugh had been [...] "destroyed as a writer", by snobbery and association with country-house living. In Sykes's view, the fleeting appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's farcical world, such as Lady Metroland, are awkward and intrusiveâ€”the world of A Handful of Dust is not outlandish: [...] "Evelyn would have done better <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> Lady Metroland and her world altogether".|$|E

[...] He complained about the reference to the Ice Warriors' code of honour, claiming it to have always been [...] "damnably dull." [...] Additionally, he disliked the revelation of Skaldak's true form, claiming it to look like [...] "a not especially memorable CGI tortoise" [...] and saying the BBC seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> that [...] "monsters are diminished when they're brought into the light", as well as worrying that it may have been [...] "breaking a taboo for the show".|$|E
500|$|Marceline has a close {{relationship}} with Finn and Jake. Marceline and Finn have many things in common with one another; in the episodes [...] "Evicted" [...] and [...] "Henchman" [...] it is stated that the reason Marceline befriended Finn is because he simply enjoys being himself. Although she has kissed Finn platonically on the cheek twice, Ward has noted that there is no romantic subtext between the two. On the other hand, Marceline and Jake share a more complex relationship. In her initial appearances, she derived pleasure from scaring Jake, who was terrified [...] "of her vampire bite". Jake, in turn, felt that she was evil and had managed to take over Finn's mind. Due to this, Jake attempted to kill her several times, to no avail. However, after the events of [...] "Henchman", Jake seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> his fear of her; in [...] "Memory of a Memory", he even refers to her as a [...] "friend" [...] in one of her memories.|$|E

[...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, summed it up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing." [...] Billy Rose said of Pipe Dream, [...] "You know why Oscar shouldn't have written that?

500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|Responses from {{critics have}} given mostly average {{reviews of the}} album. Polly Coufos from The Sunday Times {{considers}} Damien Leith as [...] "the most complete artist Australian Idol has yet uncovered". Coufos rated the album 3.5 stars, and comments that [...] "Leith uses that heavenly falsetto {{as often as possible}} without making himself appear a one-trick pony". Coufos, however says that the two cover songs, [...] "Songbird" [...] and [...] "Danny Boy" [...] are an [...] "unnecessary hedging of bets". Andrew Murfett from The Age notices the album's different arrangement from the previous Idol debuts and considers it to be better than those, but says that the album still contains too many ballad songs. Murfett remarks [...] "Songbird" [...] as a good choice for a cover song. Lauren Katulka from 'Oz Music Scene' compliments Leith's songwriting and composing, and says that Where We Land [...] "is a great indication of the potential of Australia's revamped Idol franchise". Lucy Tyler from the Sydney Anglican Network says that though the album is well-produced; it is unbalanced and bland, and [...] "its lack of variety means that it gives listeners little to think about". Tyler notes that Where We Land focuses on the melancholic aspects of life and remarks that [...] "Leith appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> that life can sometimes be happy, too".|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from gaming critics. Most critics acknowledged that Warriors of Rock {{was an attempt}} to distance itself from its competitor, the Rock Band series, and a return to the Guitar Hero series' roots. However, in the attempt to redefine the series, some critics thought Warriors of Rock failed to recapture the experience of playing the earlier Guitar Hero games. Arthur Gies of IGN felt the game was [...] "aimless", leaving him to question [...] "why Warriors of Rock is here". Tyler Cocke of 1UP.com commented that Warriors of Rock [...] "seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> that music games are supposed to be all about having a good time". Ben Kurchera of Ars Technica considered that Warriors of Rock keeps the series [...] "treading water" [...] and lacks [...] "any real upward movement", and may have been a step back with how relaxed the game's timing windows have become compared to early Guitar Hero games. Others note that the game can be enjoyable, but only to those that are fans of the series, and is not well-suited to new or casual players. G4's Abbie Heppe found the game [...] "does an exceptional job of catering to the hardcore audience" [...] but warns the casual fan that may not enjoy the setlist to simply [...] "move along". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer postulated if Guitar Hero may have jumped the shark with the [...] "often stupid and frequently silly" [...] gameplay and visuals, but was still entertained in playing through the game.|$|E

500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's {{about as good as}} could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is going to react â€” from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E
