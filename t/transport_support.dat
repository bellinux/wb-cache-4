5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air <b>transport.</b> <b>Support</b> of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} season, Kommandøren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes {{during the winter}} months. Kommandøren was {{generally}} used as an express route ship, often carrying patients {{on their way to}} treatment. Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided <b>transport</b> <b>support</b> to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri after the completion of the exercises.|$|E

25|$|In 1955 No. 41 Squadron, {{which was}} now {{equipped}} with four Bristol Freighters and had a strength of 73 officers and airmen, was deployed to RAF Changi in Singapore {{as part of an}} expansion of New Zealand's commitment to the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve. The Bristol Freighters were slow and uncomfortable aircraft, but proved successful in transporting supplies and personnel throughout Southeast Asia. The squadron transported a very wide range of equipment, and established the first scheduled air ambulance service in Malaya. No. 41 Squadron also dropped supplies to Commonwealth forces engaged in the Malayan Emergency. On 10 December 1956 a Bristol Freighter piloted by No. 41 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader A.S. Tie, was destroyed when it crashed in the Cameron Highlands region of Malaya. Tie was killed in this accident, along with the three other aircrew, three Royal Army Service Corps air dispatchers and two Malayan film makers travelling as passengers; a fourth dispatcher survived. While the other RNZAF squadron in Malaya, No. 14 Squadron, returned home in 1958 following Malaysian independence, No. 41 Squadron remained in Singapore; at this time the squadron had a strength of three Bristol Freighters. The Whenuapai-based <b>Transport</b> <b>Support</b> Unit was responsible for training aircrew to serve with No. 41 Squadron.|$|E

2500|$|The initial air {{component}} {{based in}} Borneo consisted of detachments from squadrons stationed in Malaya and Singapore. These included Twin Pioneer and Single Pioneer transport aircraft, probably {{two or three}} Blackburn Beverley and Handley Page Hastings transports, and about 12 helicopters of various types. One of Walker's first [...] "challenges" [...] was curtailing the RAF's centralised command and control arrangements and insisting that aircraft tasking for operations in Borneo was by his HQ, not by the RAF Air Command Far East HQ in Singapore. Other aircraft of many types stationed in Malaya and Singapore provided sorties as necessary, including routine <b>transport</b> <b>support</b> into Kuching and Labuan. Rotary wing support included 60 naval and air force troop-lift helicopters and another 40 smaller army variants.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, governments provide air {{ambulance}} services, {{either directly or}} via a negotiated contract with a commercial service provider, such as an aircraft charter company. Such services may focus on critical care patient <b>transport,</b> <b>support</b> ground-based EMS on scenes, or may perform {{a combination of these}} roles. [...] In almost all cases, the government provides guidelines to hospitals and EMS systems to control operating costs—and may specify operating procedures in some level of detail to limit potential liability. However, the government almost always takes a 'hands-off' approach to actual running of the system, relying instead on local managers with subject matter (physicians and aviation executives) expertise. [...] Ontario's ORNGE program and the Polish Lotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe (LPR) are examples of this type of operating system. The Polish LPR is a national system covering the entire country and funded by the government through the Ministry of Health but run independently, there is no independent HEMS operator in Poland. [...] In North East Ohio, including Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County-owned MetroHealth Medical Center uses its Metro Life Flight to transport patients to Metro's level I trauma and burn unit. There are 5 helicopters for North East Ohio and, in addition, Metro Life Flight has one fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
