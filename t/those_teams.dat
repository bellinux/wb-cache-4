5|$|After the 1952 season, Maryland and {{six other}} schools left the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The {{following}} year, the conference honored its inaugural season's best players with an All-ACC team. In that initial class, five Terrapins were selected to the first team and two to the second team. Since 1953, Maryland players have received first-team All-ACC honors a total of 132times. Terrapins have been named to All-ACC second or third teams an additional 61times, although <b>those</b> <b>teams</b> have not been published continuously and there currently is no third team.|$|E
5|$|Cousy {{then became}} a {{broadcaster}} for Celtics games. Upon his election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 the Celtics retired his #14 jersey and hung it in the rafters of the Garden. Cousy {{was named to the}} NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971, the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1981, and the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996, making him one of only four players that were selected to each of <b>those</b> <b>teams.</b> He was also the first president of National Basketball Players Association.|$|E
5|$|He {{promptly}} {{became the}} Yankees' best pitcher, recording the highest winning percentage in the AL {{in his first}} season as a Yankee. In 1949, joined by Vic Raschi and Eddie Lopat, he was a star of a Yankee team that won the first of five consecutive league championships, a feat that had never been achieved before. He played many important roles for <b>those</b> <b>teams.</b> In his first six years with the Yankees he averaged over 232 innings, 17.5 wins, and 14 complete games. As a swingman, he averaged 26 games started and 9 games finished per season.|$|E

5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a major}} {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of <b>those</b> <b>teams</b> must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|The organisers of the Philadelphia Cycling Classic {{indicated}} that they would invite the top twenty ranked UCI teams at the end of 2014, and then any further allocations would be assigned to highly ranked national teams and other UCI teams. A list of seventeen participating teams was published in March, just over 10 weeks prior to the race. Of <b>those</b> <b>teams,</b> Astana-Acca Due O, BePink-La Classica and Cycling Canada did not feature in the race, while further teams were added to feature 96 riders across 19 teams.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} three {{classification}}s for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, {{the times of}} the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was {{the team with the}} lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team; and the Fair Play classification rewarded <b>those</b> <b>teams</b> that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes a {{narrative}} portrays a team sport in which several or {{all members of}} the team are contenders, and their success (or otherwise) is based, at least in part, on whether or not <b>those</b> <b>team</b> members provide sufficient guidance and support for one another.

5|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen made {{his case to}} bowl {{officials}} {{by saying that the}} Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4–4 teams and not played a game against the fifth, Miami. Three of <b>those</b> <b>teams</b> were selected ahead of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby North Carolina team; the Gator Bowl chose Clemson, a school with a traditionally well-traveling fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami. After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference. Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base, well-traveled fans, and greater television marketing potential.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{showed signs}} of {{improvement}} after hiring coach Scott Skiles in 2003, reaching the playoffs in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Some of the primary contributors on <b>those</b> <b>teams</b> were Ben Gordon, Luol Deng, and Kirk Hinrich. The Bulls' new playoff streak ended in 2008, when the team finished fourth in their division with a 33–49 record. After the season, the team hired a new coach, Vinny Del Negro. The Bulls' poor record did help them win the 2008 NBA Draft Lottery, which allowed them to select Derrick Rose with the first pick in the NBA Draft. They made the 2009 NBA Playoffs, only to lose in a seven-game series against the Boston Celtics which included a record seven overtime periods. In 2010, Del Negro was replaced by Tom Thibodeau, and the Bulls reached the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.|$|E
