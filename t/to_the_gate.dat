5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This {{consisted}} of a rampart, ditch, and possibly a tower, {{in front of the}} gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also to dictate the only approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the chronicle, the Byzantines {{attempted}} to poison Oleg, but the Rus' leader demonstrated his oracular powers {{by refusing to}} drink the cup of poisoned wine. Having fixed his shield <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> of the imperial capital, Oleg won a favourable trade treaty, which eventually was of great benefit to both nations. Although Byzantine sources did not record these hostilities, {{the text of the}} treaty survives in the Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E

5|$|Dolmabahçe Palace, {{the seat}} of {{government}} during the late Ottoman period, {{is located in the}} Beşiktaş district on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait, to the north of Beyoğlu. The Sublime Porte (Bâb-ı Âli), which became a metonym for the Ottoman government, was originally used to describe the Imperial Gate (Bâb-ı Hümâyûn) at the outermost courtyard of the Topkapı Palace; but after the 18th century, the Sublime Porte (or simply Porte) began to refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> of the Sadrazamlık (Prime Ministry) compound in the Cağaloğlu quarter near Topkapı Palace, where the offices of the Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) and other Viziers were located, and where foreign diplomats were received. The former village of Ortaköy is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the Ortaköy Mosque on the Bosphorus, near the Bosphorus Bridge. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus are the historic yalıs, luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes. Farther inland, outside the city's inner ring road, are Levent and Maslak, Istanbul's main business districts.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate.</b> Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|Receiving a {{broadcast}} of CIA agent Daniels being interrogated by the 33rd, the team chooses to interfere. Tracing the signal's origin, they find Daniels already {{dead and the}} broadcast was a trap set for fellow CIA agent, Gould. Gould helps Delta escape, but is later captured and killed while assaulting a location called the Gate. The team heads there and continues the attack. Finding it heavily guarded by the 33rd, the team employs white phosphorus to obliterate their opposition and advance further into the city. While walking through the aftermath, they realize they accidentally killed 47 civilians moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> for shelter by the 33rd. Walker blames the 33rd and vows revenge.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIon {{channels}} are proteins {{that control the}} flux of ions across cell membranes by opening and closing (gating) their pores. It has been proposed that channels gated by internal agonists have an intracellular gating ring that extracts free energy from agonist binding <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> using linkers that directly connect <b>the</b> <b>gating</b> ring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates.</b> Here we find for a voltage- and Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) channel that shortening the linkers increases channel activity and lengthening the linkers decreases channel activity, both in the presence and absence of intracellular Ca 2 +. These observations are consistent with a mechanical model in which the linker-gating ring complex forms a passive spring that applies force <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> in <b>the</b> absence of Ca 2 + <b>to</b> modulate <b>the</b> voltage-dependent <b>gating.</b> Adding Ca 2 + then changes <b>the</b> force <b>to</b> further activate <b>the</b> channel. Both the passive and Ca 2 +-induced forces contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gating</b> of <b>the</b> channel...|$|R

5|$|The Safety Board {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although the Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b> The Safety Board {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{was built}} by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It {{takes the form of}} a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge. The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.|$|E
5|$|Through Yorktown, NY129 is a two-lane {{residential}} street alongside the reservoir, soon making a gradual bend {{to the southeast}} into an intersection with County Route131 (CR131; Underhill Avenue), a former alignment of NY131. At the junction with CR131, NY129 turns southward, soon winding its way southeast under the lanes of the Taconic State Parkway, and back alongside the New Croton Reservoir. After crossing under the Taconic, the route then drops {{back down to the}} reservoir and passing a house reported to have been moved from Huntersville before it was flooded. Making several winds to the southeast, NY129 connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> House Bridge, soon running eastward through Yorktown. NY129 intersects with NY118 (Saw Mill River Road). This intersection serves as the eastern terminus of NY129, as NY118 continues east along the reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate, they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E
