50|$|The {{footpath}} {{along the}} Aberglaslyn Pass trackbed {{was closed to}} walkers in 2000 {{to prepare for the}} rebuilding of the railway. This closure was perhaps precipitated by the death of a cyclist who foolishly tried to ride across the decrepit former railway bridge (of 1922) over the A4085 below Nantmor. The railway company, along with the National Trust, which owns the surrounding land, worked to rebuild the Fisherman's Path for use again. This now provides a popular, if occasionally tricky, footpath from which wayfarers wave at the <b>train.</b> It is <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for cycles.|$|R
2500|$|The initial {{system had}} a {{relatively}} low capacity, but the Docklands area very quickly developed into a major financial centre and employment zone, increasing traffic. In particular Tower Gateway, {{at the edge of}} the City of London, attracted criticism for its poor connections, as it did not connect directly with the nearby Tower Hill tube station or Fenchurch Street railway station. The criticism arose partly because the system usage was higher than expected. Plans were developed, before the system opened, to extend it to [...] in the west and Beckton in the east. Stations and trains were extended to two-unit length, and the system was expanded into the heart of the City of London to [...] through a tunnel, which opened in 1991. This extension left [...] on a stub. The original <b>trains</b> were <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for use underground due to a lack of fire-proofing. They were operated for a time on the above-ground sections only, and were later sold.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Training {{systems for}} laparoscopic surgery {{are useful for}} basic <b>training</b> but are <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for {{specific}} <b>training</b> corresponding to the condition of a given patient. We, therefore, have developed an unusual training system: a patient-specific simulator for laparoscopic surgery. When specific data of each individual patient are entered, this system helps surgeons perform a “rehearsal” operation. We applied this technique in laparoscopic surgery by using volume data obtained by multislice computed tomography imaging. Case presentation A 39 -year-old Japanese woman consulted a doctor because of back pain and underwent pyeloplasty after an examination revealed a ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Computed tomography data showed that the network of arteries and veins was very complicated. Therefore, we decided to use our simulator before performing surgery. Simulation was helpful because we could obtain information about the complicated vessel network and “rehearse” the procedure. Conclusions Our simulator allows surgeons to perform a sham operation with different perspectives and tactile sensations and has received favorable reviews from users. </p...|$|R
50|$|The first {{railway station}} in Adana {{was built in}} 1886 in the Kuruköprü area along the 67 km railway line that {{connected}} Adana to Mersin. In 1903, the Ottoman Government contracted Istanbul-Baghdad section of the Berlin-Baghdad Railway project to Germany. In 1911, the Yenice-Adana section of the Mersin-Adana railway line was merged with the Berlin-Baghdad railway project. The status of the Adana railway station was raised to a major station with the expected increase in volume. A larger station building and maintenance shops were needed to be built, but the existing <b>train</b> station was <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for expansion. So the train station in the Kuruköprü area was abandoned {{and the construction of}} a new train station was started in 1911 on farmland north of the city. The construction of the new railway station was completed in September 1912, covering an area of 45 hectares. It contained a station building, staff residences, maintenance shops and a foundry.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project is an environmental {{scan of the}} programs designed to overcome barriers to accessing post-secondary education in Canada, with a particular focus on the Maritime Provinces. The economic importance of education is critical to a jurisdiction’s prosperity; not only on a financial level, but also on a social one. Numerous academic studies cite that of all investments, education provides returns far greater than most. A more educated society places fewer obligations on social services such as health, unemployment insurance, and welfare. The goal {{of this paper is}} to outline barriers that would prevent qualified, willing, and able students from attending post-secondary studies following a student’s successful completion of secondary education. University, college, and other vehicles of post-secondary <b>training</b> are <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for everyone. The objective of the paper is not to promote post-secondary education as the right option for everyone, but instead focus on identifying the hurdles and barriers of those who have a desire and ability to pursue post-secondary education in Canada. Once these barriers are identified, the purpose {{of this paper is to}} outline particular programs designed to service and support efforts to decrease, reduce, or eliminate the barriers identified. This research article contains detailed resources that exist in the form of programs to support potential students in efforts to obtain higher education, as well as a review of the gaps and opportunities that could exist from identified programs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Symbol {{synchronization}} {{in traditional}} hardwaredriven communication systems {{has relied on}} the transmission of training sequences of symbols just {{before the beginning of}} the frame symbols. The use of <b>training</b> sequences is <b>not</b> <b>suitable</b> for software-driven communication systems, such as lightweight acoustic underwater sensor networks [4, 5], in which the high symbol loss rate may cause the loss of training symbols, preventing accurate symbol synchronization. Software-driven communication networks require symbol synchronization that is resilient to a high loss environment, that does not represent large communication or processing overhead, and that is tunable to the noise profile of different environments. These requirements are emphasized for mote-based acoustic underwater sensor networks in which the bandwidth and processing capability are sparse. This paper proposes the use of a short signature synchronization symbol (S 4) as both a preamble and post-amble to enable receiver synchronization in mote-based acoustic communication systems that rely on software modems. To synchronize to an incoming signal, the receiver performs cross-correlation of N reference signature symbols with the incoming signal to identify the beginning of the preamble and post-amble. The output of the cross-correlation yields 2 N peak values, from which the receiver chooses the sharpest and most symmetric for synchronization {{to the beginning of the}} frame. Empirical experiments confirm a synchronization accuracy within 5 ms in air within a range of 10. 5 m, and 11 ms in water within a range of 15 m. I...|$|R
