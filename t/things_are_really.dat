25|$|Ferris {{admits that}} there is a {{tendency}} for descriptions of cosmology towards philosophy and also to lean towards theology. His theories lean towards the basis that the span of human being existence is part of the universe design. His views of God are not as taught in churches and synagogs but that the existence of the ultimate cause and the essential nature of <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> unknown. He points out that one can not support the personal theology theories of conventional religions against today's established principles of cosmology. Ferris wraps up his book with intellectual arguments for God with his Contrarian Theological Afterword.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{most of the}} {{judiciary}} Denning firmly believed that the press {{should have access to}} the courts and freedom to criticise magistrates and judges. He believed all legal proceedings should be held in public, quoting Jeremy Bentham when he said that [...] "in the darkness of secrecy all sorts of things can go wrong. If <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> done in public {{you can see that the}} judge does behave himself, the newspapers can comment on it if he misbehaves— it keeps everyone in order".|$|E
2500|$|Outside of {{the film}} industry, Keaton has {{continued}} to pursue her interest in photography. As a collector, she told Vanity Fair in 1987: [...] "I have amassed a huge library of images– kissing scenes from movies, pictures I like. Visual <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> key for me." [...] She has published several more collections of her own photographs, and has also served as an editor for collections of vintage photography. Works she has edited {{in the last decade}} include a book of photographs by paparazzo Ron Galella; an anthology of reproductions of clown paintings; and a collection of photos of California's Spanish-Colonial-style houses.|$|E

5000|$|In 1641 {{he wrote}} [...] "Scotland’s Thanksgiving to the Lord for her armies safe, joyful and {{ponderous}} returning from England", perhaps realising how <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> playing out.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{the other}} man can see what <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> like he holds a bleaker vision of what the future has in store. Up until hearing {{the sound of music}} he has hardly ventured out and not {{travelled}} far at that. Although he has offered to be the fiddler’s eyes he becomes annoyed when continually asked to describe how things are and when he tells him that it’s “day” he feels the need to add an “if you like” casting a shadow of doubt on even this simple answer. Later on when he imagines things they might come across in their travels he only mentions the gutter and a muckheap. He doesn’t believe anyone will ever return so when things start to fall apart between the pair he laments: “I’ll never see anyone again.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was," [...] Ruth {{replied with a}} laugh and a blush. [...] "You see these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> very much wanted by the North sea fishermen, and a great many benevolent women spend much time in {{knitting}} for them--and not only women, but also boys." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} [...] "Jewish geography" [...] are unclear. Sarah Benor, a {{linguist}} {{and professor of}} Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College has noted [...] "Sometimes that kind of <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> impossible to find." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Popinjoy {{asked the}} people," [...] Barnes says gravely. [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> doosed well done. The woman looked frightened; but she's pretty, and I am told the {{daughter}} {{will have a}} great lot of money." ...|$|R
5000|$|Asked {{about these}} similarities, Bellow said [...] "I don't {{know that that}} sort of <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> relevant. I mean, it's a curiosity about reality which is impure, let's put it that way. Let's both be bigger than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Strether {{thought a}} minute. [...] "Well then if those <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> your motive catch the French steamer and sail to-morrow. Of course, {{when it comes}} to that, you're {{absolutely}} free to do as you choose. From the moment you can't hold yourself I can only accept your flight." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS M. [An elderly female schoolboy] How do you do? There's a spiffing crowd. I believe <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> going Bolshy. How do you do, Lord William? Have {{you got any}} of {{our people}} to show? I told one or two, in case--they do so simply love an outing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'George and I are {{satisfied}} that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> very promising here. Of course, much old heathen ignorance, and {{much that is}} very wrong, will long survive. So you recollect perhaps old Joe (great- Uncle Edward's coachman) declaring that C. S. as a witch, {{and there is little}} proof of practical Christianity in the morals of our peasants of the west, and of Wales especially.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will change}} all that," [...] she said. [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> {{more serious than}} we expected, and more difficult. But we came here to work and win, and we're going to do it. Aren't we, Uncle John?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{motion was}} carried. Apparently {{there was nothing}} further to do now, and the people were glad, for, privately, they were {{impatient}} {{to get out and}} rush {{to the scene of the}} tragedy, and see whether that barrel and the other <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> there or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Germans won't {{allow her}} to cross the lines. What does it matter, Uncle? We have plenty of room. In three hours we can be rid of them, and doubtless the poor <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> anxious to find her lost husband, who was last seen in Dunkirk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] replied the {{managing}} director, [...] "there {{is a good}} deal doing. I have written to St. Just appointing the local manager, and it is probable that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> under way by this time; besides, I shall set out for Cornwall to-morrow to superintend matters, leaving my able secretary in charge here in the meantime, and when he hears from me this paper may be completed and advertised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We never do," [...] said Miss Oliver. [...] "That {{is why we}} are {{not left}} to choose our own means and measure of development, I suppose. No matter how much we value what our lessons have brought us we don't want to go on with the bitter schooling. Well, let us hope for the best, as Susan says; <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> going well now and if Rumania lines up, the end may come with a suddenness that will {{surprise}} us all." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{talked of}} religion; I {{think she was}} the first person to thaw the private silences that had kept me bound in these matters even from myself for years. I can still recall her face, a little flushed and coming nearer to mine after avowals and comparisons. [...] "But Stephen," [...] she says; [...] "if none of these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> true, why do they keep on telling them to us? What is true? What are we for? What is Everything for?" ...|$|E
60|$|Or else--If the <b>thing</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> bad, then God did {{not make}} it. It must be a disease, a mistake, a failure, of man's making, or some person's making, but not of God's making. For all {{that he has made}} he sees eternally; and behold, it is very good.|$|R
60|$|And as I {{realized}} this, I saw simultaneously how I {{could throw}} one more sop to my exigent conscience. After all, the whole <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{a question of}} hard cash. By kidnapping Ogden I should be taking money from Mr Abney. By paying my premium I should be giving it back to him.|$|R
5000|$|H.P. Lovecraft said of The Wendigo: [...] "Another amazingly potent {{though less}} artistically {{finished}} tale Blackwoods is The Wendigo, {{where we are}} confronted by horrible evidences of a vast forest daemon about which North Woods lumber men whisper at evening. The manner in which certain footprints tell certain unbelievable <b>things</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a marked triumph in craftsmanship." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned her}} head slowly and looked at him. There was a strange, {{repressed}} fire in her eyes. [...] "You are a very foolish person," [...] she said. [...] "Your parents, I suppose, were small shopkeepers, or something of the sort, and you were brought up at a board-school and Julian Orden at Eton and Oxford, and yet he understands, and you do not. You see, heart counts, and sympathy, and the flair for understanding. I doubt whether these <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> found where you come from." ...|$|E
6000|$|One farmer says to me, [...] "You cannot live on {{vegetable}} food solely, for it furnishes {{nothing to}} make bones with"; {{and so he}} religiously devotes {{a part of his}} day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle. Some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do, do," [...] said he with energy. [...] "Do; {{come and}} live among us, and {{be one of}} us; come and partake with us at the feast which we are making ready; come and eat of our crusts, and dip {{with us in the}} same dish; come and be of our flock, and go with us into the {{pleasant}} pastures, among the lanes and green hedges which appertain to the farm of the Lord. Come and walk with us through the Sabbath cornfields, and pluck the ears when you are a-hungered, disregarding the broad phylacteries. Come and sing with us songs of a joyful heart, and let us be glad together. What better can you do, Miss Mackenzie? I don't believe there is a more healthy place in the world than Littlebath, and, considering that the place is fashionable, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> very reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|When he re-entered the {{laboratory}} his visitor {{was looking at}} his watch. [...] "I had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time," [...] he said. [...] "Twelve minutes to four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer. I have an engagement at four." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Heraclitus, the {{one is the}} many. Every <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> fire. In passing away, {{the things}} of the world show {{a desire to be}} {{consumed}} in the all-destroying cosmic fire. When {{they are part of the}} fire again, their desire is briefly satisfied. But things soon come into being again as a result of the fire's impulse to play a game with itself.|$|R
60|$|He {{told me that}} <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> {{serious in}} Zululand, so serious that he {{thought there was a}} {{probability}} of immediate war between the English and the Zulus. He said also that Cetewayo, the Zulu king, had sent messengers to stir up the Basutos and other tribes against the white men, with the result that Sekukuni had already made a raid towards Pilgrim's Rest and Lydenburg.|$|R
6000|$|S. [...] "No, dearest boy, we will rather {{pity and}} {{instruct}} them lovingly; remembering always {{that we shall}} become such as they the moment we begin to fancy that truth is our own possession, and not the very beauty of Zeus himself, which he shows to those whom he will, and in such measure as he finds them worthy to behold. But to me, considering how great must be the condescension of Zeus in unveiling to any man, even the worthiest, the least portion of his own loveliness, there has come at times a sort of dream, that the divine splendour will at last pierce through and illumine all dark souls, even {{in the house of}} Hades, showing them, as by a great sunrise, both what they themselves, and what all other <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>really</b> and in the sight of Zeus; which if it happened, even to Ixion, I believe that his wheel would stop, and his fetters drop off of themselves, and that he would return freely to the upper air, {{for as long as he}} himself might choose." ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{exercise}} a controlling interest in nine billion dollars' worth of railways; in two billion dollars' worth of industrial concerns; in one billion dollars' worth of life insurance groups; in one billion dollars' worth of banking groups; in two billion dollars' worth of trust companies. Mind you, I {{do not say}} you own all this, but that you {{exercise a}} controlling interest. That {{is all that is}} necessary. In short, you exercise a controlling interest in such a proportion of the total investments of the United States, as to set the pace for all the rest. Now to my point. In the last few years seventy billions of dollars have been artificially added to the capitalization of the nation's industries. By that I mean water--pure, unadulterated water. You, the merger, know what water means. I say seventy billions. It doesn't matter if we call it forty billions or eighty billions; the amount, whatever it is, is a huge one. And what does seventy billions of water mean? It means, at five per cent, that three billions and a half must be paid for things this year, and every year, more than <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> worth. The people who labor have to pay this. There is theft for you. There is high prices for you. Who put in the water? Who gets the theft of the water? Have I put it in your hand? ...|$|E
60|$|It must be evident, however, {{that the}} mere {{introduction}} of a particular mode of exchanging things for one another, by first exchanging a thing for money, and then exchanging the money for something else, makes {{no difference in the}} essential character of transactions. It is not with money that <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> purchased. Nobody’s income (except that of the gold or silver miner) is derived from the precious metals. The [dollars or cents] which a person receives weekly or yearly are not what constitutes his income; they are a sort of tickets or orders which he can present for payment at any shop he pleases, and which entitle him to receive a certain value of any commodity that he makes choice of. The farmer pays his laborers and his landlord in these tickets, as the most convenient plan for himself and them; but their real income is their share of his corn, cattle, and hay, and it makes no essential difference whether he distributes it to them directly, or sells it for them and gives them the price. There can not, in short, be intrinsically a more insignificant thing, in the economy of society, than money; except in the character of a contrivance for sparing time and labor. It is a machine for doing quickly and commodiously what would be done, though less quickly and commodiously, without it; and, like many other kinds of machinery, it only exerts a distinct and independent influence of its own when it gets out of order.|$|E
50|$|While the Twisters {{suffered}} several hard-luck losses {{through their}} {{first half of}} their inaugural season, <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> tumultuous behind the scenes. After a home-opener crowd of 5,109 on June 21 against the Washington Warthogs (a 7-6 overtime loss), the crowds at Market Square Arena dwindled to 2,563 by a July 27 game against the Portland Pride and 2,125 who witnessed a 12-10 loss to the Anaheim Splash on August 14.|$|R
50|$|The {{key is to}} {{work out}} the few <b>things</b> that <b>are</b> <b>really</b> important, and the few methods that will give us what we really want.|$|R
60|$|Never underrate the {{difficulties}} which your pupils {{will have to}} encounter, or try to persuade them that what you assign is easy. Doing easy <b>things</b> <b>is</b> generally dull work, and it is especially discouraging and disheartening for a pupil to spend his strength in doing what <b>is</b> <b>really</b> difficult for him, when his instructer, by calling his work easy, gives him no credit, for {{what may have been}} severe and protracted labor. If a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> hard for the pupil, his teacher ought to know it, and admit it. The child then feels that he has some sympathy.|$|R
