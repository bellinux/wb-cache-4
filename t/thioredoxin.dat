5|$|The <b>thioredoxin</b> system {{contains}} the 12-kDa protein <b>thioredoxin</b> and its companion <b>thioredoxin</b> reductase. Proteins related to <b>thioredoxin</b> {{are present in}} all sequenced organisms. Plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of <b>thioredoxin</b> consists of two neighboring cysteines, {{as part of a}} highly conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. In its active state, <b>thioredoxin</b> acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active <b>thioredoxin</b> is regenerated by the action of <b>thioredoxin</b> reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E
5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and <b>thioredoxin.</b> One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (<b>thioredoxin</b> reductase) generates reduced <b>thioredoxin,</b> a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E

25|$|The enzyme {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis of}} dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein <b>thioredoxin.</b> Regeneration of <b>thioredoxin</b> occurs when {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms that are used to reduce the disulfide groups of <b>thioredoxin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Metabolic {{adaptation}} in tumours {{balances the}} cells' need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks and tighter control of redox balance. As a result, production of NADPH is greatly enhanced, which {{functions as a}} cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis {{and at the same}} time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and <b>thioredoxin</b> (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the {{inhibitory}} RuBP, CA1P, and the other inhibitory substrate analogs by activase requires the consumption of ATP. This reaction is inhibited {{by the presence of}} ADP, and, thus, activase activity depends on the ratio of these compounds in the chloroplast stroma. Furthermore, in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation (redox) state through another small regulatory protein, <b>thioredoxin.</b> In this manner, the activity of activase and the activation state of RuBisCO can be modulated in response to light intensity and, thus, the rate of formation of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate.|$|E

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the presence of either pathway is essential but which of these pathways operates in ribonucleotide reductase reduction and how this function contributes to the pathways' essential nature have not been definitively established. We have identified two in vivo redox forms of the S. cerevisiae ribonucleotide reductase R 1 subunit, which correspond to catalytically reduced or oxidized enzymes. Cells lacking <b>thioredoxins,</b> which exhibit an elongated S phase, accumulate R 1 in its oxidized form and also contain significantly decreased deoxyribonucleotide levels during the S phase. Overexpressing R 1 in these cells increases both {{the amount of the}} R 1 reduced form and the concentrations of deoxyribonucleotides and accelerates DNA replication.

25|$|GAPDH acts as {{reversible}} metabolic switch under oxidative stress. When {{cells are}} exposed to oxidants, they need excessive amounts of the antioxidant cofactor NADPH. In the cytosol, NADPH is reduced from NADP+ by several enzymes, three of them catalyze the first steps of the Pentose phosphate pathway. Oxidant-treatments cause an inactivation of GAPDH. This inactivation re-routes temporally the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, allowing the cell to generate more NADPH. Under stress conditions, NADPH is needed by some antioxidant-systems including glutaredoxin and <b>thioredoxin</b> {{as well as being}} essential for the recycling of gluthathione.|$|E
