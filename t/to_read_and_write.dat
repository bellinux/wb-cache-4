Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind.

5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one.

In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783.

5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955.

The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>write</b> on its magnetic drum memory, {{so it was not}} the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E
40|$|There are {{conflicting}} hypotheses for {{the causes}} of Dyslexia in <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> difficulties, such as the phonological deficit hypothesis, double deficit hypothesis, magnocellular deficits hypothesis etc. The cause of the difficulties may vary between individuals.

We conducted this study to identify individual differences in the effect of Dyslexia.

In this study, we considered how phonological awareness, visual perception, and phonological processing are related <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> abilities in the Japanese language.

The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery.

It is uncertain how well educated Edward was; there is little evidence for his ability <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>write,</b> although his mother was keen that her other children were well educated, and Ferre was himself a relatively learned man for the period. Edward likely mainly spoke Anglo-Norman French in his daily life, in addition to some English and possibly Latin.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>and</b> <b>write</b> English.|$|E
