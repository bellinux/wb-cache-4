5|$|From January until May, the Parrett {{provides}} {{a source of}} European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>this</b> endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E
5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice.

5|$|Since common {{starlings}} eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, {{they are considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, {{and this was one}} of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>this</b> mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E

5|$|The Levels {{have few}} wooded areas, just {{occasional}} willow trees. The landscape {{is dominated by}} grassland, mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70per cent of the area being grassland and 30per cent arable. From January until May, the River Parrett provides a source of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them.

5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>this</b> population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E

25|$|The {{education}} system had a near-collapse in 2000–2005. During this time, exams were not held, teachers were not paid, and schools {{did not have}} enough funding to continue. As a result, over half of the schools closed. In 2009, the Australian Government partnered with the Nauruan Department of Education <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> <b>This</b> agreement resulted in a 5.7% increase in students, teachers with a degree increased from 30% to 93%, and over A$11 million was used to construct a new secondary school.|$|E

At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E
500|$|Having {{established}} himself as the premier defensive backcourt player, Bowen's effective, but hard nosed style of play came under discussion. In particular, rival guards Vince Carter and Steve Francis accused him of encroaching into their landing space during their jumpshot. Inside Hoops columnist M.J. Darnell commented: [...] "They're whining because Bruce Bowen has frustrated, upset, hurt or angered them in some way.... He just plays tough, physical defense, does not play with any intent to injure, but isn't afraid to get in someone's grill". Bowen's defensive style failed <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>this</b> Spurs squad repeat in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, as the team was eventually defeated 4–2 by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semi-Finals.|$|E

500|$|General Samuel Jones, {{commander}} of the Confederate Armies in southwest Virginia, was informed of the Union Army's movements beginning midday July 18. [...] Jones' headquarters was at the Dublin railroad depot—east of Wytheville along the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. Jones intercepted a passenger train on the railroad line around 3:00pm, and the train was used to haul soldiers and equipment to Wytheville. He sent two small newly organized companies, employees from his headquarters, and some local citizens who volunteered <b>to</b> <b>help.</b> <b>This</b> group totaled to about 130, and was led by Major Thomas M. Bowyer. Bowyer's men were well armed, and brought two pieces of artillery plus additional small weapons for the locals. The train carrying Bowyer and his men was delayed because it {{had to wait for}} an eastbound train to pass.|$|E

I will {{certainly}} work for Inter in the future in the club board. I never imagined that I was going to remain here for such a long time. What I will never forget is the love that I have received since my first day here from my teammates and president Massimo Moratti. I will never forget it; Inter have given me the chance to start a winning cycle with some extraordinary people." [...] Figo was on the sidelines when Inter won the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League on 22 May 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Michael Strahan's retirement, Tuck was {{promoted}} to starting defensive end. When asked about the pressure of replacing Strahan, Tuck replied [...] "Pressure? No, I'm smart enough to realize there's only one Strahan and there will always only be one Strahan. I'm not trying to replace Michael Strahan. I'm just trying to fill in and do my best <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>this</b> football team win. I'm not pinning that pressure on my back, as far as {{going out there and}} getting 22 sacks in a season." [...] But Tuck started his 2008 campaign in Michael Strahan-like fashion by sacking Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell in the first play of the season opener. The Giants went on to defeat their division rivals the Washington Redskins 16–7. Tuck followed his exceptional performance in week one with an outstanding performance against the St. Louis Rams. Tuck finished the game with 2.0 sacks and an interception return for a touchdown in a Giants victory in week two. The interception and touchdown marked the first of Tuck's professional career. The touchdown was his first since his junior season at Notre Dame.|$|E
2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've never been one to say the pressure was too much for me, but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>this</b> team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E
