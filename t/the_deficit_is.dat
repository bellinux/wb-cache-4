25|$|In Alzheimer's disease, {{sulfatide}} in {{the brain}} tissue decreases tremendously, starting {{in the early stages}} of the disease. In the mild stages of Alzheimer's disease, the loss of sulfatide can be up to 50% in the white matter and up to 90% in the gray matter {{in the brain}}. Sulfatide concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid is also lower in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The characteristic loss of neuronal function associated with Alzheimer's disease occurs via the loss of neurons and synapses, and <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> lipid class specific to sulfatides. When comparing sulfatide depletion to other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is the only case in which sulfatide is so dramatically depleted; in dementia no marked sulfatide depletion is observed, while in Parkinson's disease, sulfatide levels are dramatically elevated, and multiple sclerosis patients only have a moderate sulfatide depletion. Additionally, the loss of sulfatide has been observed to only occur at the very beginning of the disease while at more severe stages, minimal additional sulfatide loss occurs.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien {{promised to}} renegotiate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and reform to the {{unemployment}} insurance system. In regards to NAFTA, the Red Book pronounced itself {{in favor of}} a North American free trade zone in principle, but went on to accuse Mulroney of having given away too much to the Americans and Mexicans when he signed NAFTA in 1992, and stated that the Liberal government would renegotiate NAFTA on more favorable terms to Canada within six months of taking office. Failing that, the Red Book promised that Canada would renounce NAFTA. The main emphasis in the Red Book was on a promise to spend $6billion on improving infrastructure in a Keynesian move to fight the recession of the early 1990s. As regarding the debt situation, Chrétien promised in the Red Book to reduce Canada's deficit to 3 per cent of GDP (the same deficit to GDP ratio required to enter the European Union) within three years of taking office. Chrétien {{made it clear that the}} 3% deficit to GDP ratio would apply only to the federal government, whereas the Maastricht Treaty of 1991 which set out the 3% deficit to GDP ratio in order to enter the European Union stated that this applied to all levels of government. The Red Book went on to promise that a Liberal government would achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to 3% of the GDP by cancelling the contract to buy the Sea King helicopters and to privatise Pearson airport in Toronto and by eliminating unspecified [...] "waste" [...] in the government. After the 3% target had been achieved within the first three years of taking office, the Red Book promised that the deficit would be eliminated at some unspecified time in the future. Martin, who had been the leader of the team that had produced the Red Book had wanted to promise to eliminate the deficit altogether, but had been overruled by Chrétien, who had wanted to present the Liberals as the [...] "caring" [...] party that would defend social programs, unlike the [...] "heartless" [...] Tories and the Reform Party who Chrétien claimed wanted to eliminate the deficit within two or three years by gutting social programs with no thought for any suffering that this might cause. Chrétien claimed in his campaign speeches that Reform's plans for eliminate the deficit within two or three years of taking office would cause at least a 25% unemployment rate, if not higher, which Chrétien claimed starkly in a series of speeches would cause a bloody [...] "revolution". Chrétien had personally chosen the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP as it made the Liberals seemed fiscally responsible while at the same time promised that the Liberals would not inflict too much economic pain to achieve that fiscal responsibility. One Liberal candidate Herb Dhaliwal recalled that for Chrétien at time of the 1993 election that the national deficit was not a major issue and that: [...] "His attitude was that <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> ok as long as you can manage it". To support its economic claims, the Red Book gave costs for each of the Liberals' policy goalsthe first time a Canadian party had gone to such lengths to prove that its proposals were fiscally responsible.|$|E

60|$|I {{introduced}} this digression with an apology, yet have extended {{it so much}} further than I had designed, that I must once more request my reader to excuse me. It {{was to be expected}} (I have said) that Lord Nelson would appreciate the isle of Malta from its relations to the British fleet on the Mediterranean station. It was the fashion of the day to style Egypt the key of India, and Malta the key of Egypt. Nelson saw the hollowness of this metaphor; or if he only doubted its applicability in the former instance, he was sure that it was false in the latter. Egypt might or might not be the key of India, but Malta was certainly not the key of Egypt. It was not intended to keep constantly two distinct fleets in that sea; and the largest naval force at Malta would not supersede the necessity of a squadron off Toulon. Malta does not lie in the direct course from Toulon to Alexandria; and from the nature of the winds (taking one time with another) the comparative length of the voyage to the latter port will be found far less than a view of the map would suggest, and in truth of little practical importance. If it were the object of the French fleet to avoid Malta in its passage to Egypt, the port-admiral at Valetta would in all probability receive his first intelligence of its course from Minorca or the squadron off Toulon, instead of communicating it. In what regards the refitting and provisioning of the fleet, either on ordinary or extraordinary occasions, Malta was as inconvenient as Minorca was advantageous, not only from its distance (which yet was sufficient to render it almost useless in cases of the most pressing necessity, as after a severe action or injuries of tempest), but likewise from the extreme difficulty, if not impracticability of leaving the harbour of Valetta with a NW. wind, which often lasts for weeks together. In all these points his lordship's observations were perfectly just; and it must be conceded by all persons acquainted with the situation and circumstances of Malta, that its importance, as a British possession, if not exaggerated on the whole, was unduly magnified in several important particulars. Thus Lord Minto, in a speech delivered at a county meeting, and afterwards published, affirms, that supposing (what no one could consider as unlikely to take place) that the court of Naples should be compelled to act under the influence of France, and that the Barbary powers were unfriendly to us, either in consequence of French intrigues or from their own caprice and insolence, there would not be a single port, harbour, bay, creek, or roadstead in the whole Mediterranean, from which our men-of-war could obtain a single ox or a hogshead of fresh water, unless Great Britain retained possession of Malta. The noble speaker seems not to have been aware, that under the circumstances supposed by him, Odessa too being closed against us by a Russian war, the island of Malta itself would be no better than a vast almshouse of 75,000 persons, exclusive of the British soldiery, all of whom must be regularly supplied with corn and salt meat from Great Britain or Ireland. The population of Malta and Gozo exceeds 100,000, while the food of all kinds produced on the two islands would barely suffice for one-fourth of that number. <b>The</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>is</b> procured by the growth and spinning of cotton, for which corn could not be substituted from the nature of the soil, or, were it attempted, would produce but a small proportion of the quantity which the cotton raised on the same fields and spun into thread, enables the Maltese to purchase, not to mention that the substitution of grain for cotton would leave half of the inhabitants without employment. As to live stock, it is quite out of the question, if we except the pigs and goats, which perform the office of scavengers in the streets of Valetta and the towns {{on the other side of}} the Porto Grande.|$|E
