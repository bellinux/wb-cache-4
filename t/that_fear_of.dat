5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E

First, it implied <b>that</b> the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> {{is at least}} sometimes rooted in cognition or beliefs, not Pavlovian associations with prior panic experiences. Second, it implied <b>that</b> the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> could precede panic experiences and even predict panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, phobias, and other anxiety conditions.|$|R
25|$|The {{only way}} to officially leave Jehovah's Witnesses is to {{disassociate}} or be disfellowshipped, and both entail {{the same set of}} prohibitions and penalties, with no provision for continued normal association. Sociologist Andrew Holden has claimed <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> family break-up or loss causes people who might otherwise freely leave the group to remain members. Jehovah's Witnesses state that disfellowshipping is a scripturally documented method to protect the congregation from the influence of those who practice serious wrongdoing. Critics contend that the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature, directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organization's own teachings and can be used in an arbitrary manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen. The percentage {{of high school students}} in the US who reported that they have ever had sexual intercourse dropped from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007 and to 43% in 2011. A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being afraid of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E

She includes fears arising for example, from economic insecurity, unemployment and the lack of adequate shelter. Franklin points to what she calls [...] "the threat system" [...] which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society.|$|E

Another inspiration for the song came from Lee's life, [...] "That song is me talking to myself about not being afraid and coming back to this thing and living the life I was born to live.

500|$|The film {{is often}} {{credited}} with making Amitabh Bachchan a [...] "superstar", {{two years after}} he became a star with Zanjeer (1973). Some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in Sholay; for example, Mac Mohan continued {{to be referred to}} as [...] "Sambha", even though his character had just one line. Major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials, promos, films and sitcoms. Amjad Khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career. He also played Gabbar Singh again in the 1991 spoof Ramgarh Ke Sholay, and reprised the role in commercials. The British Film Institute in 2002 wrote <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Gabbar Singh [...] "is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep". The 2012 film Gabbar Singh, named after the character, became the highest grossing Telugu film up to that point. Comedian Jagdeep, who played Soorma Bhopali in the film, attempted to use his Sholay success to create a spinoff. He directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film Soorma Bhopali, in which Dharmendra and Bachchan had cameos.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Somebody Scream!: Rap Music's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power, Marcus Reeves said <b>that</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> a Black Planet [...] "was {{as much a}} musical assault on America's racism {{as it was a}} call to blacks to {{effectively}} react to it". According to Greg Kot, the album was [...] "hardly a black power manifesto for world domination, but a statement about racial paranoia. Though he spares virtually no one with his withering raps, Public Enemy's Chuck D is harshest of all on his fellow blacks, expounding on everything from history to fashion: Use your brain instead of a gun. Drugs are death. Know your past so you won't screw up the future. Gold chains worn around the neck demean the brotherhood in South Africa." [...] Kot wrote of Chuck D's perspective and the theme of fear, [...] "It's fear that divides us, he says; understand me better and you won't run. Fear of a Black Planet is about achieving that understanding, but on Public Enemy's terms. In presenting their view of life from an Afro-centric, as opposed to Euro-centric, perspective, P.E. challenges listeners to step into their world." ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. In a non-clinical population, <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> {{compassion}} and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> happiness {{have both been}} found to be highly correlated with alexithymia and depression. This study sought to explore these processes and their links with adult attachment and social safeness and pleasure in a depressed group. Method. A total of 52 participants suffering from moderate to severe depression completed measures <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> happiness, compassion from others and for self, in addition to measures of alexithymia,attachment, social safeness and depression, anxiety and stress. Results. <b>Fears</b> <b>of</b> {{compassion and}} happiness were highly correlated with alexithymia, adult attachment, and depression, anxiety, and stress. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> happiness was found to be the best predictor of depression, anxiety, and stress, whereas <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> compassion from others was the best predictor of adult attachment. A path analysis showed <b>that</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> positive emotion fully mediate the link between alexithymia and depression. This clinical sample had higher mean scores in <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions, alexithymia, and depression,anxiety, and stress than a previously studied student sample. Conclusions. This study adds to the evidence <b>that</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions are important features of mental health difficulties. Unaddressed, these fears can block positive emotions and may lead to emotional avoidance of positive affect thus contributing as blocks to successful therapy. Therapies for depression may therefore profitably assess and desensitize the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions...|$|R

60|$|We {{shall see}} {{something}} curious {{in the last}} of these verses, when we compare it with one in the chapter before.

But this chapter says, <b>that</b> the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the Lord is the END of wisdom too; for it says, that if we seek earnestly after knowledge and understanding, THEN we shall understand the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.|$|R
500|$|Upon first seeing it, Georgije was displeased by Jovanović's {{depiction}} of the exodus, particularly the sight of sheep and wagons carrying women and children, saying it made the migrants look like [...] "rabble on the run". The source of the Patriarch's displeasure lay in differing interpretations of what had originally caused the migration to take place; the Church maintained that Arsenije was simply heeding {{the call of the}} Holy Roman Emperor to head north. Having studied Ruvarac's work, Jovanović came to hold the view <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman persecution, rather than the desire to protect the Habsburg frontier, had prompted the migrants to leave their homes. Jovanović duly took the painting back to his studio and altered it to the Patriarch's liking, removing the sheep, lumber wagons, and the woman and her infant son, putting stylized warriors in their place. He also placed the letter Leopold had supposedly sent the Serbs inviting them to settle Vojvodina in the hand of , a priest riding beside Arsenije. Although these changes were made relatively quickly, Jovanović could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest. Hence, only the Vršac triptych was displayed at the Millennium Exhibition.|$|E
500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and <b>that</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E
