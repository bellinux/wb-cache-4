5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E

25|$|Edward C. Tolman was a {{contemporary}} of Hull whose theory of learning was {{proved to be}} more logical and less complicated than Hull’s work. Tolman showed <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> is goal directed and not controlled by random drives and reinforcement. Tolman used maze experiments with rats to show that rats can learn without reinforcement and are better understood as directed by goals and driven by cognitive expectancies. This finding provided a serious challenge to much of Hull’s learning theory.|$|E

25|$|Reinforcement is the {{key element}} in operant {{conditioning}} and in most behavior change programs. It is {{the process by which}} behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of <b>that</b> <b>behavior,</b> then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 {{review of}} hadrosaur eggshell and {{hatchling}} material from Alberta's Dinosaur Park Formation, Darren Tanke and M. K. Brett-Surman concluded that hadrosaurs nested {{in both the}} ancient upland and lowlands of the formation's depositional environment. The upland nesting grounds may have been preferred by the less common hadrosaurs, like Brachylophosaurus and Parasaurolophus. However, the authors were unable to determine what specific factors shaped nesting ground choice in the formation's hadrosaurs. They suggested <b>that</b> <b>behavior,</b> diet, soil condition, and competition between dinosaur species all potentially influenced where hadrosaurs nested.|$|E
25|$|In operant conditioning, {{the type}} and {{frequency}} of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, {{in the presence of}} a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).|$|E

50|$|Psychologists {{have been}} {{interested}} in the factors that are important in behavior change and control since psychology emerged as a discipline. One of the first principles associated with learning and behavior was the Law of Effect, which states <b>that</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated, whereas <b>behaviors</b> <b>that</b> lead to undesired outcomes are less likely to recur.|$|R
25|$|Many {{biologists}} {{fell into}} two camps: the geneticists, who mostly {{worked in the}} laboratory; and naturalists, who studied natural populations {{in the field and}} museums, and put much of their effort into taxonomy. Each contributed concepts that were essential to the understanding of evolution. Naturalists introduced the biological species concept, the definition of species as a community that is reproductively isolated and occupies a distinctive ecological niche. They also recognized that species are polytypic, having variations in time and space; and <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> and change of function can give rise to evolutionary change.|$|E
25|$|Motivating operations, MOs, {{relate to}} the field of {{motivation}} in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence future behavior. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.|$|E
25|$|Perceptual {{control theory}} (PCT) is a {{psychological}} theory of animal and human behavior originated by William T. Powers. In contrast with other theories {{of psychology and}} behavior, which assume <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> {{is a function of}} perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with engineering control theory, the reference variable for each negative feedback control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the setpoint of the controller. PCT also applies to nonliving autonomic systems.|$|E
50|$|Immuno-psychiatry is a {{discipline}} that studies {{the connection between}} the brain the immune system.

25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the debate over the viability of neo-Lamarckism, in 1896 James Mark Baldwin, Henry Fairfield Osborne and C. Lloyd Morgan all independently proposed a mechanism where new learned behaviors could cause the evolution of new instincts and physical traits through natural selection without resort to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolution of new instincts and eventually new physical adaptations. This became known as the Baldwin effect and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.|$|E
25|$|On the Union side, Rosecrans held {{a council}} {{of war with}} most of his corps and {{division}} commanders to determine {{a course of action}} for September 20. The Army of the Cumberland had been significantly hurt in the first day's battle and had only five fresh brigades available, whereas the Confederate army had been receiving reinforcements and now outnumbered the Federals. Both of these facts ruled out a Union offensive. The presence of Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana at the meeting made any discussion of retreating difficult. Rosecrans decided that his army had to remain in place, on the defensive. He recalled that Bragg had retreated after Perryville and Stones River and could conceivably repeat <b>that</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
25|$|Punishment is {{a process}} by which a {{consequence}} immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of <b>that</b> <b>behavior.</b> As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added (positive punishment) or removed (negative punishment). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out'). Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects. Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.|$|E
50|$|Sociobiology {{is based}} on the premise <b>that</b> some <b>behaviors</b> (social and individual) are at least partly {{inherited}} and can be affected by natural selection. It begins with the idea <b>that</b> <b>behaviors</b> have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.|$|R

25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E
25|$|Extinction is the {{technical}} term {{to describe the}} procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of <b>that</b> <b>behavior.</b> The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction. Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of shaping procedures.|$|E
25|$|Structured {{cognitive}} behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based {{process with}} core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities {{in the fields}} of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce recidivism.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{claim that}} the results of these tests are {{susceptible}} to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates. Primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue <b>that</b> <b>behaviors</b> said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses. Advocates counter <b>that</b> the <b>behaviors</b> are different from normal responses to another individual. Cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, because they have no pointing ability.|$|R

500|$|Moore {{frequently}} {{moved around}} the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Panama, Nebraska, Alaska, New York, and Virginia, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: [...] "When you move around a lot, you learn <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, various {{philosophers}} such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor {{tried to}} resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called [...] "folk psychology" [...] while adhering to a materialist {{vision of the world}} which did not violate the [...] "generality of physics". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.|$|E

The city was built with a [...] "crime ecosystem", where petty crimes or calls for help were always occurring outside of the main story, requiring the player to decide to stop to help or not to resolve them. A portion of the team was devoted to implementing {{the behavior of the}} citizens of the city and how <b>that</b> <b>behavior</b> would change as the state of the city altered due to the player's actions. Climbing buildings was considered to be an important aspect of the game, both as part of the superhero motif and because it was considered [...] "fun to do", and Sucker Punch set out to make the whole city climbable. Many details of every building have been modeled to allow the player to climb the buildings, [...] "down to the last window frame, lighting sconce and storefront", however, Fox noted that getting the climbing system [...] "just right" [...] was the most challenging aspect of development. One employee was dedicated to making sure the entire city was climbable. Fleming noted that during Infamous's development, both Crackdown and Assassin's Creed, two games with alternative takes on the climbing aspect, were released; the team felt that each of the games' climbing systems had their own strengths and weaknesses. To reflect the nature of change of the city as the player interacts with it—either restoring power or taking it away—the developers created a [...] "deferred shading" [...] rendering engine that would render the effects of moving and damaged light sources.|$|E
