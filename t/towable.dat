2500|$|During the war the Brazilian navy {{had been}} criticised for its inertia. [...] It was the modern ironclad vessels of the Brazilian navy that had stood by {{and allowed the}} {{retiring}} Paraguayan army to escape across the River Paraná on rafts — together with 100,000 head of rustled cattle — without doing anything to stop them. [...] Those same vessels had been defied by two Paraguayan chatas (flat-bottomed, <b>towable</b> barges mounting a single gun). [...] Although the Brazilian naval command protested that the shallow river waters enjoined caution, the Brazilian soldiery and the Emperor Pedro II were disgusted. [...] As a result, the Brazilian Admiral Tamandaré had been relieved of his command and Joaquim José Inácio (1808-1869) had taken [...] over his functions on 2 December 1866.|$|E
50|$|Bumper Pull <b>towables</b> are {{designed}} to attach to the towing vehicle behind the rear axle on the bumper or on a receiver that {{is attached to the}} frame.

50|$|Tubes {{for use as}} <b>towables</b> {{on water}} are {{generally}} not true inner tubes but rather specially designed tubes {{for the purpose of}} recreation. These tubes are often fairly durable and come in either donut or disk shapes. A sleeve of synthetic fabric often covers the tube to prevent it from becoming elongated during towing. Such sleeves commonly have handles for the rider to grasp and an anchoring point for the tow line to be attached at.|$|R
5000|$|Variations on the ubiqutous waterski include wakeboards, water-skiing, kneeboarding, {{inflatable}} <b>towables,</b> {{and wake}} surfing. To some degree, {{the nature of}} these boating activities influences boat design. Waterski boats are intended to hold a precise course at an accurate speed with a flat wake for slalom skiing runs. Wakeboard boats run at slower speeds, and have various methods including ballast and negative lift foils to force the stern in the water, thereby creating a large and [...] "jumpable" [...] wake.|$|R

50|$|Noquebay {{was built}} in 1872. Although {{originally}} built as a schooner, she later was modified {{for use as a}} <b>towable</b> barge for hauling lumber.

50|$|Trailer Sailers are boats {{small and}} {{light enough to}} be towed by {{ordinary}} cars. Their width (beam) is constrained by road regulations. In Europe, to be <b>towable</b> on the road {{the width of the}} boat and trailer must not exceed 2.55m. The maximum weight is determined by the towing capacity of the towing vehicle and by the type of driving license.Folding trimarans are particularly well suited as trailer sailers because their narrow width with folded floats makes them <b>towable</b> on the road whilst their wide beam with floats extended makes them stable and safe on the water. Furthermore, the absence of ballast makes them considerably lighter than a keelboat of similar size (240 kg for the Astus 16.1 compared to 800 kg for a 16 ft keelboat). Heavier boats require a stronger and heavier road trailer, making the towing weight even greater.|$|E
50|$|Portable Air Power - For {{markets where}} {{mobility}} of the compressor equipment is critical. Compressors {{are designed with}} on-board diesel engines as the power source, and most models made are <b>towable</b> or can be placed on work vehicles.

5000|$|A mobile {{bleacher}} or portable bleacher {{is a type}} of bleacher {{that can}} be moved to different locations to fulfill a need for temporary or reconfigurable seating. Some units incorporate a built-in hydraulic or electric actuation system for raising and lowering the unit. Highway <b>towable</b> units are available, as well as units designed to be moved within a single venue[...]|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Engineer Thomas Purcell built a <b>towable</b> Rogallo-wing glider with an {{aluminum}} frame, wheels, {{a seat and}} basic control rods; soon he replaced the wheels for floats and motorized the aircraft. In 1964, Swiss inventor Pierre Aubert saw a photo of NASA's Fleep and completed construction of a similar trike. As with the Fleep, his Rogallo wing was fixed and did not allow for pendulum weight-shift control.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose {{vehicles}} {{were assigned to}} support Mt Hebo AFS. Two 4-wheel drive 40 passenger buses were used primarily for taking children to and from schools in Hebo and Cloverdale. An ambulance was available for emergencies.

Heavier boats require a stronger and heavier road trailer, making the towing weight even greater.|$|E
50|$|Bofors also {{developed}} a <b>towable</b> carriage which they displayed in April 1935 at a show in Belgium. This mount allowed the gun to be fired from the carriage with no setup required, although with limited accuracy. If time was available for setup, the gunners used the tow-bar and muzzle lock as levers, raising the wheels {{off the ground and}} thereby lowering the gun onto supporting pads. Two additional legs folded out to the sides, and the platform was then leveled with hand cranks. The entire setup process could be completed in under a minute.|$|E
50|$|The {{paravane}} {{weapon was}} developed by the British inventor Sir Dennistoun Burney as a means to sweep enemy mines. Towed behind a ship, the paravane wire would either cut the mine's mooring cable or bring the mine and paravane together, detonating the mine. There are offensive and defensive paravanes. There are main paravanes and auxiliary protector paravanes. Some paravanes are equipped with cable cutters that cut the moored mines. Explosive paravanes are essentially a <b>towable</b> or controllable mine. The US Department of Defense continues to have interest in paravanes.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, besides soldiers, {{a variety}} of {{vehicles}} began to appear, mostly in the military field. One such detailed diecast vehicle was a Royal Artillery 4.5" [...] Howitzer <b>towable</b> cannon that fired toy shells. For a toy, it was intricately designed, with a special threaded post with rotating knob to raise and lower the cannon. Also in early 1950s, {{one of the first}} Britains vehicles was a Bluebird land speed record car of famed driver Sir Malcolm Campbell. It had a removable body and the box showed a detailed cut-away illustration of the car.|$|E
5000|$|The Palomino brand {{was founded}} in 1968 by Vanguard Industries in Savage, Minnesota. In 1972, they moved their {{manufacturing}} facility to Colon, Michigan, where it remains to this day. Palomino was purchased by Forest River, Inc., in 2002. [...] This allowed for rapid growth {{and the introduction of}} two new <b>towable</b> lines of travel trailers and fifth wheels, Puma, Sabre, and Columbus. Palomino has grown to one of the top 5 RV manufacturers in North America. Palomino RV produces tent campers, truck campers, travel trailers, fifth wheels and toy haulers.|$|E
5000|$|St. Joe Boom Company, a {{non-profit}} {{association for the}} purpose of organizing and sorting logs, set up in 1902 by F.J. Davies of the Rutledge Timber Company. [...] Had the powerful 85 foot tug St. Joe built by P.W. Johnson, and later came to own four steam tugs, Bronc, Western, Samson, and ERT, as well as two gasoline-engined vessels, the tugs Lark and Powerful. [...] The company owned 8,000 boom sticks (used to confine logs into <b>towable</b> log rafts) as well a barge which carried both a dredge and a pile driver.|$|E
50|$|At {{amusement}} parks, {{the carnival}} games are usually {{owned and operated}} by the park owner. The games are usually installed in permanent buildings stationed around the park. A traveling carnival may, however, be made up of multiple independent game concession owners. These independents owners contract their games with the carnival operator. Carnival games of this type are mounted to <b>towable</b> trailers that enable the game to be moved from site to site. However, there a still some free-standing game booths that are assembled on site. These carnival games are usually set up in rows along the midway area along with the rides.|$|E
