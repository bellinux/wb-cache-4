5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre {{is considered to be}} rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to create}} an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt {{to create an}} all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 {{eventually}} laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} anciently a hamlet called Moreton in this parish, though today only <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> and ponds remain. This hamlet was wiped out {{sometime}} in the sixteenth century. The name mort / ton (death (fr) / town) is a signal that this settlement could have been wiped out and then subsequently abandoned after the inhabitants succumbed to the Black Death.|$|R

He is also known for contributing to the growth of curling, long known as a recreational and participant-based sport, as a spectator sport. Martin retired from competitive curling in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and to lay <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for more economic involvement.|$|E

The {{emphasis in the}} text is on transfer problems which are not lexically triggered, concentrating mainly on the translation of differences in mood and tense. Laying <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> for <b>the</b> translation part, the treatment of verb-phrase syntax and semantics is described in detail. The paper also shortly discusses some lexically triggered complex transfer problems...|$|R

5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was {{the basis of his}} attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
5|$|Knott's major {{shortcomings}} were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds {{that continued}} to rage in the state, {{including one that}} lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved {{the construction of the}} Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for this project.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E

40|$|In the {{graduation}} thesis the proper methodology {{to estimate the}} necessary extent and structure of buildings areas and municipal infrastructure was shown. An empirical test of the proposed methodology of Železniki municipality spatial planning documents preparation was shown. Estimation of the necessary extent and structure of building areas and municipal infrastructure {{should be included in}} <b>the</b> expert <b>groundwork,</b> which is used when the municipality spatial planning documents are prepared. In the year of 2007 a new law on spatial planning was passed. New spatial planning documents have to be prepared by the municipalities, but <b>the</b> proper expert <b>groundwork</b> must be followed. Spatial planning documents define the development of any activity in the area. That is why we must be familiar with the development characteristics of the activities when preparing <b>the</b> expert <b>groundwork.</b> <b>The</b> proper spatial planning documents for the appropriate development of activities in the area can be prepared only when this guideline is followed...|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} a medieval rabbit warren were {{unearthed}} in 2004. when <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> for a new spa extension to the hotel were being excavated. An underground tunnel was found extending at least 100 metres beneath the main manor house garden terrace. The tunnel is intact as of 2004, but {{has not yet been}} fully explored. Earth bore tunnels of this type are sometimes associated with High Middle Ages abbeys, palaces, and castles as secret escape routes if the site were under siege.|$|R
5|$|The Uranium Committee was a {{committee}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) that succeeded the Advisory Committee on Uranium and later evolved into the S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), when that organization absorbed the NDRC in June 1941, and the S-1 Executive Committee in June 1942. It laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for the Manhattan Project by initiating and coordinating the early research efforts in the United States, and liaising with the Tube Alloys Project in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} weeks of the {{earthquake}} swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists' assessment laid <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> for many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of manned-submersible dives in August and September.|$|E

Starting in the late 2000s, the tour began to collect accolades for its successes, and in 2010 the tour was named one of the top concert tour designs of all time.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{abandoned}} {{research into}} Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun {{work on the}} book The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects.

It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E

During World WarI, Wrigley joined the Australian Flying Corps and saw combat with No.3 Squadron on the Western Front, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits.
