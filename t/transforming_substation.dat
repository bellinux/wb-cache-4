Total {{estimated cost}} for the grid with a 10  % other cost factor equals approximately US$ 9, 900, 000. Dividing the cost upon the 55 production wells, each well would have an initial cost of US$ 180, 000.|$|E

This paper developed a logic verification device based on 4 G wireless communication, which used the Modbus/TCP transport protocol to access Ethernet, to complete the real-time data communication with the mobile control terminal. And this paper made a request to the logic controller according to practicality and cost. And the terminal software interface was designed by the orthogonal experimental design idea.

According to confidential data from the National Electric Power Company NEPCO Ltd. and the Electrical Distribution Company EDCO Ltd. 2011 (International Monetary fund 2009), Disi project will require establishment of one main station, 55 <b>transforming</b> <b>substations</b> from 33 to 0.415  kV (500 kVA) on each well and about 150  km of transmission lines.|$|R

Distribution substations are typically the points of voltage regulation, although on long distribution circuits (of several miles/kilometers), voltage regulation equipment may also be installed along the line.|$|R

Between the generating station and consumer, electric power may flow through several substations at different voltage levels. A substation may include transformers to change voltage levels between high transmission voltages and lower distribution voltages, or at the interconnection of two different transmission voltages.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose an {{intelligent}} agent approach to control the electric power grid at a smaller granularity {{in order to give}} it self-healing capabilities. We develop a method using the influence model to <b>transform</b> transmission <b>substations</b> into information processing, analyzing and decision making (intelligent behavior) units. We also develop a wireless communication method to deliver real-time uncorrupted information to an intelligent controller in a power system environment. A combined networking and information theoretic approach is adopted in meeting both the delay and error probability requirements. We use a mobile agent approach in optimizing the achievable information rate vector and in the distribution of rates to users (sensors). We developed the concept and the quantitative tools require in the creation of cooperating semiautonomous subsystems which puts the electric grid on the path towards intelligent and self-healing system.

40|$|A {{distribution}} urban {{power supply}} network (further, the power supply network) is {{the network of}} urban scale. Designed to transfer and distribute electric power it represents a set of <b>transforming</b> and distributional <b>substations</b> and power lines to connect them. We consider a problem of the prospective development of power supply network (PDPSN) as a task to define the ways for its optimum development in terms of configuration, equipment loads, parameters, etc., {{as well as from}} the point of view of need and terms to put into service the new objects of the power supply network. The program systems represented in the market allow us to calculate parameters of power supply systems, network operating modes, to display power supply schemes, and to make technical documentation, but they do not support the CAD of optimum network topology taking into account factors of the prospective urban development. A main objective of the work is development of mathematical model of the power supply network taking into account its prospective development. Based on this model the task is set to optimize the prospective power supply network development through the solving a problem of multi-criteria structural and parametrical optimization. Expediency is proved to use a method of reduction to the one-criteria task by means of this or that scalar convolution to solve this task. The specified problem of one-criteria optimization of PDPSN represents a problem of continuous-discrete-integer programming. The paper proves its representation as a problem of discrete programming based on the discrete approximation of possible regions to construct new <b>transforming</b> and distributional <b>substations.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|Traction {{power was}} at first {{supplied}} by two <b>substations,</b> <b>transformed</b> and converted from a 6,600 volt ac main fed from the docks generating station. The first was built three miles from Immingham by Siemens Brothers. Two Westinghouse 250 kW rotary converters produced 500 V DC for the trams. Traction feeders were installed every half-mile. The substation itself was a redbrick construction, built by Dennis Gill & Sons of Doncaster for £507. The 1913 extension was supplied by a substation within the dock estate. The second substation, continuously manned, was also built by Gill, for £707, next to the car sheds at Pyewipe. It contained three 250 kW Westinghouse rotary converters. One converter was used for lighting, one for traction and the third as a standby. From 26 November 1957 high tension power was drawn from the National Grid and the dock power station was closed down.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A railway <b>substation</b> <b>transforms</b> the {{electric}} power transmitted from electric {{power plants and}} supplies it to the railway power system for the appropriate operation of traction system. For the appropriate operation of the traction system, {{it is very important}} to maintain the security of electric power system. This paper proposes the case when an AC railway substation does not operate right, and Fault Tree(FT), Event Tree(ET) and Minimal Cut Sets(MCS) algorithm to calculate the reliability indices of railway substation. Event tree is created and gate results of fault tree analysis are used as the source of event tree probabilities. Fault tree represents the interaction of failures and basic events within a system. Minimal Cut Sets analysis is used to minimize system errors, Event Tree and Fault Tree analysis result is helpful to assessing the reliability to interpreted. The reliability indices can be used to determine the equipment to be replaced for the entire system reliability improvement...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic {{exposure}} {{of the general public}} due to large <b>substations</b> <b>transforming</b> voltages of 150 and 36 kV to 11 kV is investigated and safety distances for these substations have been determined. In total, 142 field measurements were executed for two substations: 91 measurements of the magnetic field and 51 measurements of the electric field. Measured momentary magnetic-field values are within the range of 0. 051 to 13. 17 mu T. The levels of the electric field are within the range of 0. 095 to 270. 0 V/m. The cumulative distribution function of the measured magnetic-field values has been determined, and it is shown that the fields excellently follow a lognormal distribution. The maximal magnetic-and electric-field values for all the investigated substations are below 100 mu T (values over a day and year) and 5 kV/m, respectively. When comparing the average exposure with the value of 0. 4 mu T, safety distances of maximally 8. 1 m (average day) and 7. 1 m (average year) are obtained...|$|R
