5000|$|... 2000 : Global Telecom Service (GTS) <b>Telex</b> <b>Exchange</b> {{venture with}} British Teleco.|$|E
50|$|September: The {{automatic}} transit <b>telex</b> <b>exchange</b> {{opened at}} OTC's Paddington terminal, replacing the old manual system {{which had been}} in place since 1958.|$|E
50|$|Alhaji was the Team Leader for the {{installation}} of the first Electronic <b>Telex</b> <b>Exchange</b> (ELTEX ALPHA) of Gamtel in 1990 and was responsible for its operations and maintenance for several years.|$|E
5000|$|The telex {{numbering}} plan, {{usually a}} six-digit {{number in the}} United States, {{was based on the}} major exchange where the customer's telex machine terminated. For example, all telex customers that terminated in the New York City exchange were assigned a telex number that started with a first digit [...] "1". Further, all Chicago-based customers had telex numbers that started with a first digit of [...] "2". This numbering plan was maintained by Western Union as the <b>telex</b> <b>exchanges</b> proliferated to smaller cities in the United States. The Western Union Telex network was built on three levels of exchanges. The highest level was made up of the nine exchange cities previously mentioned. Each of these cities had the dual capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections to multiple distant <b>telex</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The second level of exchanges, located in large cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami, Newark, Pittsburgh and Seattle, were similar to the highest level of exchanges in capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections. However, these second level exchanges had a smaller customer line capacity and only had trunk circuits to regional cities. The third level of exchanges, located in small to medium-sized cities, could terminate telex customer lines and had a single trunk group running to its parent exchange.|$|R
50|$|Whereas Telephone House {{housed the}} <b>telex</b> {{automatic}} <b>exchange,</b> this building held a TAS exchange {{which was used}} by the GPO to route telegrams around the UK. It also housed the Birmingham office of the Post Office Engineering Union (basement floor in Edmund Street).|$|R
5000|$|By 1935, {{message routing}} {{was the last}} great barrier to full automation. Large {{telegraphy}} providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called [...] "Telex" [...] (TELegraph <b>EXchange).</b> <b>Telex</b> machines first performed rotary-telephone-style pulse dialling for circuit switching, and then sent data by ITA2. This [...] "type A" [...] Telex routing functionally automated message routing.|$|R
50|$|Signalling {{is needed}} to {{determine}} the start and end of a call, and the destination of the connection. Two systems have been used, signalling system B CCITT U1 and CCITT U20. An international <b>telex</b> <b>exchange</b> would have signalling conversion facilities.|$|E
5000|$|... ln 1975, the International <b>Telex</b> <b>Exchange</b> was opened, {{allowing}} {{businesses to}} send telexes. Four years later, International Direct Dialling (IDD) services were introduced {{and the first}} electronic exchange was commissioned in Johor Bahru. The volume of new development was such that, in the early 1980s, the Department was compelled to appoint contractors to help build new lines and extend the cable network.|$|E
50|$|The {{negotiation}} and contract stage {{are the first}} two steps of {{the sale of a}} ship. They are normally carried out by the brokers appointed by both buyer and seller. Initially, the broker of the buyer will make the <b>telex</b> <b>exchange</b> with the seller's brokers to make an invitation to offer. The main concerns of both parties at this stage are the pricing, the particulars of the ship and the lay-days of the transaction.|$|E
5000|$|Telex {{served as}} the forerunner of modern fax, email, and texting - both {{technically}} and stylistically. Abbreviated English (like [...] "CU L8R" [...] for [...] "see you later") as used in texting originated with <b>telex</b> operators <b>exchanging</b> informal messages in real time — they became the first [...] "texters" [...] long before the introduction of mobile phones. Telex users could send the same message to several {{places around the world}} at the same time, like email today, using the Western Union InfoMaster Computer. This involved transmitting the message via paper tape to the InfoMaster Computer (dial code 6111) and specifying the destination addresses for the single text. In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and TWX machines as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union Mailgram.|$|R
50|$|Keswani {{reported}} a <b>Telex</b> <b>exchange</b> Union Carbide India manager J. Mukund (one {{of the accused}} who was convicted on June 7) sent asking for advice about coating the pipes. The U.S.-based parent company sent him a message saying that the best material for piping would be too expensive and too difficult to acquire. They highlighted how Union Carbide escaped their responsibility when they were advising Bhopal to economise on safety measures and instructed Bhopal to use cheaper material. They were advising it to compromise on safety. Mukund's message was sent on August 27, 1984 — {{a few months before}} the fateful leak.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automatic}} <b>telex</b> <b>exchange</b> {{was established}} in November 1973. Electronic Mail was put into service between Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir and Adana on June 28, 1984. In November 1985 the first radio link system was put into service between Istanbul and Ankara. On October 23, 1986, mobile telephone and paging systems were put into service in Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir. On March 4, 1987, the first ever video conference in Europe was realized in Istanbul. On February 23, 1994, GSM technology {{was established in}} the city. A nationwide Internet network and connection with the World Wide Web was established in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Telex {{provided}} the first common medium for international record communications using standard signalling techniques and operating criteria as {{specified by the}} International Telecommunication Union. Customers on any <b>telex</b> <b>exchange</b> could deliver messages to any other, around the world. To lower line usage, telex messages were normally first encoded onto paper tape and then read into the line as quickly as possible. The system normally delivered information at 50 baud or approximately 66 words per minute encoded using the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2. In the late days of the telex networks, end-user equipment was often replaced by modems and phone lines as well, reducing the telex network to what was effectively a directory service running on the phone network.|$|E
5000|$|The {{telex network}} is a {{switched}} network of teleprinters {{similar to a}} telephone network, {{for the purposes of}} sending text-based messages. The term refers to the network, not the teleprinters; point-to-point teleprinter systems had been in use long before telex exchanges were formed starting in the 1930s. Teleprinters evolved from telegraph systems, and, like the telegraph, they used {{the presence or absence of}} a pre-defined level of current to represent the mark or space symbols. This is as opposed to the analog telephone system, which used differing voltages to encode frequency information. For this reason, telex exchanges were entirely separate from the telephone system, with their own signalling standards, exchanges and system of [...] "telex numbers" [...] (the counterpart of a telephone number). When telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>exchange</b> equipment was co-located, which was not uncommon, the different signalling systems would sometimes cause interference.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1968, Sayle {{was sent}} to Prague to cover the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Fellow journalist Harold Jackson has written of Sayle's ingenuity in getting their stories out of the country. International telephone calls were blocked, and the Russians had seized the Prague <b>telex</b> <b>exchange.</b> Sayle and Jackson discovered {{that not all of}} the telex connections were blocked and spent 13 hours dialling [...] "the 10,000 possibilities" [...] to find a working telex code. After discovering several working exchanges, Jackson recalled that the enterprising Sayle sold the numbers to other journalists at [...] "$100 a pop." [...] Another obstacle facing the foreign press in Prague was a shortage of Czech crowns. Sayle took Jackson with him {{to the office of the}} Czech firm responsible for distribution of The Times in Czechoslovakia. Sayle claimed to be the publisher's personal representative and demanded that the man turn over funds that had not been remitted due to exchange restrictions. Jackson recalled, [...] "We left the building with huge packs of Czech crowns stashed in a linen bag rustled up from some cupboard. They kept the foreign press corps functioning for weeks, no doubt at a suitable rate of exchange." ...|$|E
