40|$|As {{cross-border}} {{movements of}} goods, capital, and labor are intensifying, {{it is likely}} that goods markets in East Asia will become increasingly integrated. This study investigates the current state of goods market integration in East Asia by measuring the extent of cross-border price differentials. Specifically, this study shows that compared with the European Union (EU), East Asian markets are neither sufficiently integrated nor are they showing any price convergence over time. Examining the factors and hurdles that prevent East Asian countries from approaching the European level of market integration, this study also shows that such wide price differentials could be explained largely by greater exchange rate volatilities and wider intra-regional income gaps, together with insufficient regionalization efforts. This result highlights the importance of a <b>three-pronged</b> integration <b>strategy</b> covering trade, money, and development policies, and of East Asia-wide regional institutions which, incorporating both developed and developing Asian countries, help promote more free trade agreements (FTAs) and prevent financial crises...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} the corporate strategy of SingTel and show {{how they can}} be derived from a combined analysis of its internal and external environment. An outside-in, position-based approach using the PorterÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s Five Forces (PFF) model is used to analyse the complexities and forces shrouding the industry with the aim of identifying the key opportunities and threats. An inside-out, resource-based approach using the Resource Based View (RBV) is also undertaken to reveal SingTelÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s key strengths and weaknesses. Interviews were also conducted with two key management executives within SingTel to gain a first hand understanding of the strategic issues from an insider perspective. Integrating the results of these two analysis and insights into a SWOT framework, a synthesis of the key strategic factors is then performed to match those strengths that can exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats, and at the same time, determine what new competence needs to be acquired by SingTel to overcome the potential of external threats exploiting its current weaknesses. It is shown that the strategic choices that SingTel has made as its corporate strategy are congruent and aligned with the dynamics of its internal and external environment. SingTelÃ�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�s <b>three-pronged</b> corporate <b>strategy</b> of leading in local market; inorganic growth through overseas investment and innovation to mitigate commoditisation, are intricately shaped by the SWOT analysis as derived from RBV and PFF.

The support program utilized a <b>three-pronged</b> community organization <b>strategy</b> including informa-tional, enabling and training components. Participation in the program and implementation process was monitored at all public sector worksites including the 17 human service districts. In-place health promotion programs and organizational climate were also assessed using semi-structured interviews with key informants at the human service districts. Sixteen of the 17 districts had adopted smoking control policies (designated smoking areas) {{at the close of}} the program.

40|$|In 1999, {{one in four}} British {{children}} {{lived in}} poverty—the third highest child poverty rate among industrialized countries. Five years later, the child poverty rate in Britain had fallen {{by more than half}} in absolute terms. How did the British government accomplish this and what can the United States learn from the British experience? Jane Waldfogel offers a sharp analysis of the New Labour government’s anti-poverty agenda, its dramatic early success and eventual stalled progress. Comparing Britain’s anti-poverty initiative to U. S. welfare reform, the book shows how the policies of both countries have affected child poverty, living standards, and well-being in low-income families and suggests next steps for future reforms. Britain’s War on Poverty evaluates the <b>three-pronged</b> anti-poverty <b>strategy</b> employed by the British government and what these efforts accomplished. British reforms sought to promote work and make work pay, to increase financial support for families with children, and to invest in the health, early-life development, and education of children. The latter two features set the British reforms apart from the work-oriented U. S. welfare reforms, which did not specifically target income or program supports for children. Plagued by premature initiatives and what some experts called an overly ambitious agenda, the British reforms fell short of their intended goal but nevertheless significantly increased single-parent employment, raised incomes for low-income families, and improved child outcomes. Poverty has fallen, and the pattern of low-income family expenditures on child enrichment and healthy food has begun to converge with higher-income families. As Waldfogel sees it, further success in reducing child poverty in Britain will rely on understanding who is poor and who is at highest risk. More than half of poor children live in families where at least one parent is working, followed by unemployed single- and two-parent homes, respectively. Poverty rates are also notably higher for children with disabled parents, large families, and for Pakistani and Bangladeshi children. Based on these demographics, Waldfogel argues that future reforms must, among other goals, raise working-family incomes, provide more work for single parents, and better engage high-risk racial and ethnic minority groups. What can the United States learn from the British example? Britain’s War on Poverty is a primer in the triumphs and pitfalls of protracted policy. Notable differences distinguish the British and U. S. models, but Waldfogel asserts that a future U. S. poverty agenda must specifically address child poverty and the income inequality that helps create it. By any measurement and despite obstacles, Britain has significantly reduced child poverty. The book’s key lesson is that it can be done...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} how the TRIZ concept of Ideality was used to inform the development and deployment of a ‘free-to-use’ TRIZ database of scientific and physical effects. The TRIZ ‘Time and Scale’ framework (also known as Nine Boxes, Nine Windows or System Operator) is used to structure the narrative based on three phases: Pre-Development, Development and Post-Development. In the Pre-Development phase it was recognized that most comprehensive effects databases tend to be commercial products providing excellent content but at a price presenting a potential barrier to their use, especially by those new to TRIZ. The few ‘free-to-use’ effects databases that were available tended to be less comprehensive than {{the best of their}} commercial rivals. This led to an Ideal Outcome (or Ideal Final Result) for the effects database: “delivery of complete and perfect results to any user without restriction or cost”. This highlighted a contradiction between the performance of the system (primarily represented by {{the quality and quantity of}} the results it produces) and the cost of delivery (primarily represented by the cost of developing the database infrastructure and collecting and collating the database content). As the project moved into the Development Phase this contradiction was tackled using a <b>three-pronged</b> Ideality-based <b>strategy</b> of: focus on delivering only the essential Benefits, reduction of Harms that detract from the essential Benefits and finally reduction of Costs by using existing and/or low-cost resources. Focusing on essential Benefits resulted in the selection of a simple database design that minimised the data required to populate the database. The principle Harm (where Harm is an output that is not useful) considered was that of an inaccuracy in the results delivered to the User. A taxonomy of database inaccuracies was compiled and each identified inaccuracy type considered in terms of its influence on the Ideality of the database system. This revealed, somewhat surprisingly, that inaccuracies were not only inevitable but were also not critical to the overall usefulness of the system. The principle resources used for cost reduction were: open-source database development tools, available internet resources and people. The Post-Development Phase was triggered in October 2011 with the deployment of the database on the Oxford Creativity website (www. triz. co. uk). The principle activity since that time has been a series of content updates. In addition consideration has been given (somewhat belatedly) to other aspects of the Post-Development column of the Nine Box model. The User's perception of Ideality has shifted from “Can I have more results” to “There are a lot of suggestions here – can they be filtered in some way?” This is a useful reminder that (in common with most systems) the database falls short of delivering the Ideal Outcome of complete and perfect results. Some candidate routes towards the realization of this Ideal are suggested...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} proteomics technologies to get insight into several aspects of phosphorylation signaling dynamics. The core tool in all performed experiments is mass spectrometry (MS) -based phosphoproteomics. In Chapter 1, a general introduction is given into proteomics and MS-based proteomics workflows. In Chapter 2, we evaluate and explore a peptide-centric antibody generated to selectively enrich peptides containing the PKA consensus phosphorylation motif [R/K][R/K/X]X[pS/pT]. This targeted phosphoproteomic strategy, in combination with stable isotope dimethyl labeling, is used to profile temporal changes of potential PKA substrates in Jurkat T lymphocytes upon PGE 2 stimulation, which increases intracellular cAMP, thereby activating PKA. It is shown that this approach is very specific and highly complementary to a large-scale phosphoproteomics approach, enabling to profile hundreds of putative PKA sites. In Chapter 3, the phosphopeptide enrichment robustness of Ti 4 +-IMAC is evaluated. First, we prove that Ti 4 +-IMAC enrichment allows a highly reproducible quantification of phosphorylation sites in HeLa cells. Subsequently, we apply this strategy to monitor the phosphoproteome of Jurkat T lymphocytes upon PGE 2 stimulation, covering extended time series. We demonstrate that this enrichment strategy in combination with label-free quantification enables in-depth investigation of phosphorylation dynamics, highlighting differential regulation of different kinases over time. In Chapter 4, we employ a <b>three-pronged</b> MS-based proteomics <b>strategy</b> to identify the direct targets and downstream signaling effect of four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and nilotinib) in A 431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, as a model system for skin-cancer. The integration of chemical proteomics and phosphoproteomics allows us to define a set of signaling nodes modulated by each individual drug that can be considered putative targets in epithelial cancers. In Chapter 5, we assess the beneficial use of complementary proteases, namely trypsin, LysC, GluC, AspN and chymotrypsin for the phosphoproteome analysis of Jurkat T cells, analyzed by using Ti 4 +-IMAC enrichment. The obtained results are a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest. We demonstrate that nearly each phosphosite {{can be linked to}} a preferred protease forming detectable phosphopeptides, whereby the gain in using alternative proteases can be more than 10, 000 fold for specific sites in intensity. Moreover, many of the identified sites are not yet reported in currently available and public depositories, demonstrating the complementary nature of these enzymes, through which different parts of the phosphoproteome can be uncovered...|$|R

50|$|Stroh then {{implemented}} a <b>three-pronged</b> <b>strategy</b> {{to revitalize the}} company: developing new products, brewing beer under contract for other brewers, and expanding overseas. The new product area was critical because the explosion in beer brand and types of beer in the 1990s undermined the market share for all established brands.
