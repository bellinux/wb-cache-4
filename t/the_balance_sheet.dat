5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E

40|$|From the Executive Summary. Eight {{years after}} the start of Europeâ€™s {{financial}} crisis, the legacy of non-performing loans and excessive private debt remains a key obstacle to the recovery of bank credit and investment. We argue that efforts to reduce and remove NPLs from <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of creditors must simultaneously remove excess debt from <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of debtors.

5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Concern was {{expressed}} at York's poor support {{towards the end}} of their third season in the Football League, and director G. W. Halliday believed the only solution was a change of ground. A major problem was the ground's relatively inaccessible location, and in early 1932, York held preliminary discussions about moving to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club. A special meeting of the shareholders was held, in which chairman Arthur Brown drew attention to gate receipts figures in Fulfordgate's three Football League seasons, which represented average crowds of 4,000 and a deficit on <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> It was pointed out by Halliday that within onemile (1.6km) of Bootham Crescent the population was 30,000, whereas it was only 3,000 for a similar radius of Fulfordgate. The directors were satisfied that the new ground would fulfil all requirements, although there was some opposition to the move. Two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited. Following much discussion, the decision to move to lease Bootham Crescent was approved by 115votes to 37, and Fulfordgate was sold and developed as a housing estate. Today, Eastward Avenue occupies the area where the ground once stood.|$|E

25|$|In most legal systems, a {{bank deposit}} {{is not a}} bailment. In other words, the funds {{deposited}} {{are no longer the}} property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a deposit account (a checking or savings account). That deposit account is a liability on <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of deposit liabilities are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.|$|E
25|$|Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{there was}} no {{regulation}} of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the Securities Act of 1933 was enacted. It required the disclosure of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> profit and loss statement, the names and compensations of corporate officers, about firms whose securities were traded. Additionally those reports had to be verified by independent auditors.

25|$|In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers {{to record}} changes in value {{resulting}} from business transactions. Generally speaking, the sources for spending money in transaction account is credit (that is, an entry is {{made on the}} right side of the account's ledger) and what the money obtained with the credits is destined as debit in transaction accounts (that is, an entry is made on the left side). The credits here could be share capital, revenues, etc. and The debits here could be assests, dividends, etc. From a technical point of view the sides refer to <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> placement of accounts.
