5|$|One of the {{conclusions}} {{of the study was}} that the people buried in Lindow Moss may have had a less varied diet than their European counterparts. According to Jody Joy, curator of the Iron Age collection at the British Museum, the importance of Lindow Man lies more in how he lived rather <b>than</b> <b>how</b> he died, as the circumstances surrounding his demise may never be fully established.|$|E

Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or general ledger), nonprofits can {{have more than one}} general ledger (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E

25|$|The hazards {{posed by}} a {{capacitor}} are usually determined, foremost, {{by the amount}} of energy stored, which is the cause of things like electrical burns or heart fibrillation.

25|$|Before 2005, donor lungs {{within the}} United States were {{allocated}} by the United Network for Organ Sharing on a first-come, first-served basis to patients on the transplant list. This {{was replaced by}} the current system, in which prospective lung recipients of age of 12 and older are assigned a lung allocation score or LAS, which takes into account various measures of the patient's health. The new system allocates donated lungs according to the immediacy of need rather <b>than</b> <b>how</b> long a patient has been on the transplant list. Patients who are under the age of 12 are still given priority based on how long they have been on the transplant waitlist. The length of time spent on the list is also the deciding factor when multiple patients have the same lung allocation score.|$|E
25|$|Guan Yu was {{returning}} to Nan Commandery when he heard that his territories in Jing Province had fallen to Lü Meng. He sent messengers to meet Lü Meng, who brought them {{on a tour of}} the city. When the messengers returned to Guan Yu, they spread the word that their families were well. Guan Yu's troops lost their fighting spirit after hearing that Lü Meng treated their families better <b>than</b> <b>how</b> Guan Yu treated them in the past. Guan Yu knew that he had lost and was isolated, so he withdrew to Maicheng (麥城; around present-day Maicheng Village, Lianghe Town, Dangyang, Hubei). When they reached Zhang District (漳鄉) in the west, Guan Yu's men deserted and surrendered to Sun Quan's forces. Sun Quan sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to block Guan Yu's retreat route. Guan Yu and his son Guan Ping were captured by Sun Quan's forces in an ambush and subsequently executed. Liu Bei lost all his territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan.|$|E

Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island <b>than</b> <b>how</b> Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E

25|$|On November 15, 1960, {{with the}} arrival of the R27s, service on the Brighton Line was as follows: Express was {{designated}} as Q, local via tunnel as QT, and local via bridge as QB. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the Independent Subway System (IND). However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons and for the sake of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection. Moreover, it was deemed more important and informative to indicate how the trains actually operated rather <b>than</b> <b>how</b> the letters were manipulated. Starting January 1, 1961, weekday Brighton Express service terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue all day. On Saturdays, these trains provided local service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach. This service was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and was discontinued altogether in February 1963. (The Sunday service to Brighton Beach had been discontinued on January 1, 1961.) Brighton Local service ran to Astoria – Ditmars Boulevard at all times. On Saturdays, they provided express service on the Brighton Line, and ran local all other times. This service change was essentially a swap between the north terminals of the Brighton Local and Fourth Avenue Local, and between the Brighton Express and West End Express. Prior to this time, both Brighton services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. This change served to keep one Brighton service available in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.|$|E

[...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not {{in the position to}} offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ...

She avoided using a voiceover, which was present in the novel, [...] "... partly because {{it would make it}} very literary." [...] Instead, she focused on conveying Griet's thoughts visually– for example, in her adaptation Griet and Vermeer inspect the camera obscura together under his cloak amidst sexual tension; whereas, in the novel Griet views it alone immediately after him and enjoys the lasting warmth and scent he leaves.|$|E
500|$|Fishburne {{was pleased}} by {{the concept of the}} film, stating he was [...] "really moved by it", so that he {{accepted}} to take his part [...] "at an affordable rate", according to producer Michael Romersa.

About the character, Atchison said that Larabee is [...] "vulnerable" [...] and [...] "a very sensitive guy" [...] that has [...] "a quiet moral authority".

500|$|The {{concept of}} Zero {{starring}} {{in his own}} series was proposed by Inafune. Inafune proposed that Zero star in his own series, and planned {{to go forward with}} the idea at the end of Mega Man X5. However, he was unable to after Capcom announced another Mega Man title without his involvement. Designed by Toru Nakayama of Inti Creates, Zero was meant to have a more [...] "human feel" [...] rather than the complete [...] "mechanical feel" [...] of the X series. Nakayama wanted the public to recognize that this series was different from the X series. Since Capcom wanted Zero's general structure to be the same, Inti-Creates concentrated on how different they could make him, rather <b>than</b> <b>how</b> similar. Zero's depiction in the series was intended to be morally ambiguous and depend on the perspective, appearing as a hero from one point of view and a terrorist from another.|$|E

He concluded that he was unable to stop playing the song after he heard it. Bill Lamb of About.com said the song was [...] "brilliant". He continued, [...] "The song is sweet, funny, bratty, and edgy all at the same time. Taylor Swift remains one of our most gifted young lyricists." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine thought that [...] "Speak Now" [...] exemplified Swift's inability to [...] "write authoritatively about anything other <b>than</b> <b>how</b> great boys are or how much boys suck or how dreams about boys will take her somewhere better than where she is now." ...|$|E

In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had a heart of gold. She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E
