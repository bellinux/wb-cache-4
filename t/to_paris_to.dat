5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux had been sent <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part}} of the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E

Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his ballet master Antoine Titus <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> {{find a new}} ballet for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose Giselle. The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years {{of service to the}} Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare moved <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> work as {{a street}} performer. He {{appears to have been}} {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E

She spent three years in Algeria, taking a lover named Muhamed.|$|E

5|$|The {{disagreements}} between Edward and the French Crown {{over the}} Duchy of Gascony {{led to the}} War of Saint-Sardos in 1324. Charles, Edward's brother-in-law, had become King of France in 1322, and was more aggressive than his predecessors. In 1323, he insisted that Edward come <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> give homage for Gascony, and demanded that Edward's administrators in Gascony allow French officials there to carry out orders given in Paris. Matters {{came to a head}} in October when a group of Edward's soldiers hanged a French sergeant for attempting to build a new fortified town in the Agenais, a contested section of the Gascon border. Edward denied any responsibility for this incident, but relations between Edward and Charles soured. In 1324, Edward dispatched the Earl of Pembroke <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> broker a solution, but the earl died suddenly of an illness along the way. Charles mobilised his army and ordered the invasion of Gascony.|$|E

5|$|William Huskisson {{was born}} at Birtsmorton Court, Malvern, Worcestershire, on 11 March 1770. In 1783, Huskisson went <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> live with his great-uncle Dr. Richard Gem, {{witnessing}} {{the early years of}} the French Revolution, and was present at the Storming of the Bastille. Learning economics from the Marquis de Condorcet, he became an assistant to Earl Gower, who would later become the Marquess of Stafford.

5|$|Back in London, the Claimant {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, {{who agreed to}} go with him <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{spent the}} summer of 1851 abroad, {{including}} a visit <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the state Senate. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin {{emerged as one of}} the leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state's senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to meet again before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the second ballot, and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat Solomon W. Downs.|$|E

5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> <b>to</b> Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War was consumed engaging in intensive training over the Wash which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield Cunningham flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. Cunningham made no recorded contact with the enemy and France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bonaparte became {{increasingly}} influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: {{one for the}} troops in his army and another for circulation in France. The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator. All told, Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels; atop that, his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>to</b> lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio, and Bonaparte returned to Paris in December as a hero. He met Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of Britain.|$|E
