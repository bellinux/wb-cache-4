40|$|We revisit {{a theory}} of skyrmion {{transport}} in ferromagnets. On a basis of an effective U(1) gauge theory for spin-chirality fluctuations in double-exchange ferromagnets, we derive an expression for the velocity of a skyrmion core driven by the dc electric field. We find that mutual feedback effects between conduction electrons and localized spins give rise to Chern-Simons terms, suggesting a dissipationless mechanism for the skyrmion Hall current. A conventional description of the current-induced skyrmion motion, appearing through the spin transfer <b>torque</b> and <b>scattering</b> events, is reproduced in a certain limit of our description, where the Chern-Simons terms are not fully incorporated. Our theory is applicable to not only metallic but also insulating systems, where the purely topological and dissipationless skyrmion Hall current can be induced {{in the presence of}} an energy gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of optical scattering and thermal radiation models an the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect is studied. Lambertian formulation is compared with Hapke scattering and emission laws and Lommel-Seeliger reflection. Although {{the form of}} reflectivity function strongly influences mean <b>torques</b> due to <b>scattering</b> or thermal radiation alone, their combined contribution to the rotation period YORP is {{not much different from}} the standard Lambertian values. For higher albedo values the differences between the Hapke and Lambert models become significant for the YORP in attitude. Comment: MNRAS accepted, 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We present concise, {{computationally}} efficient formulas {{for several}} quantities of interest [...] including absorbed and scattered power, optical force (radiation pressure), and <b>torque</b> [...] in <b>scattering</b> calculations performed using the boundary-element method (BEM) [also {{known as the}} method of moments (MOM) ]. Our formulas compute the quantities of interest directly from the BEM surface currents with no need ever to compute the scattered electromagnetic fields. We derive our new formulas and demonstrate their effectiveness by computing power, force, and torque {{in a number of}} example geometries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric study of giant planet migration through the combined action of disk <b>torques</b> and planet-planet <b>scattering.</b> The <b>torques</b> exerted on planets during Type II migration in circumstellar disks readily decrease the semi-major axes a, whereas scattering between planets increases the orbital eccentricities ǫ. This paper {{presents a}} parametric {{exploration of the}} possible parameter space for this migration scenario using two (initial) planetary mass distributions {{and a range of}} values for the time scale of eccentricity damping (due to the disk). For each class of systems, many realizations of the simulations are performed {{in order to determine the}} distributions of the resulting orbital elements of the surviving planets; this paper presents the results of ∼ 8500 numerical experiments. Our goal is to study the physics of this particular migration mechanism and to test it against observations of extrasolar planets. The action of disk <b>torques</b> and planet-planet <b>scattering</b> results in a distribution of final orbital elements that fills the a−ǫ plane, in rough agreement with the orbital elements of observed extrasolar planets. In addition to specifying the orbital elements, we characterize this migration mechanism by finding the percentages of ejected and accreted planets, the number of collisions, the dependence of outcomes on planetary masses, the time spent in 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances, and the effects of the planetary IMF. We also determine the distribution of inclination angles of surviving planets and the distribution of ejection speeds for exiled planets...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the force and}} torque exerted by light pressure on an irregularly shaped dielectric resonator allow to detect resonant frequencies, delivering information complemental to the scattering cross section by mechanical means. The peak-to-valley ratio in the torque signal can be many times larger than in the scattering cross section, and, furthermore, depends {{on the structure of}} the resonance wave pattern. The far-field emission pattern of the associated quasibound states can be tested by the angular dependence of the mechanical mechanical probes at finite amplification rate. We relate the force and <b>torque</b> to the <b>scattering</b> matrix and present numerical results for an annularly shaped dielectric resonator...|$|R
40|$|The extrasolar planets {{discovered}} to date possess larger eccentricities and smaller semi-major axes than similar planets {{in our solar}} system. It is not thought possible for these planets to form in situ; we propose they result {{from a combination of}} disk <b>torques,</b> planet-planet <b>scattering,</b> and magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. The torques exerted on planets during Type II migration in circumstellar disks readily decrease the semi-major axes a, whereas scattering between planets increases the orbital eccentricities e. Disk turbulence induces a random walk in the planets' orbital elements. We present a parametric exploration of the possible parameter space for this migration scenario using a range of timescales for eccentricity damping (due to the disk) and the overall magnitude of the MHD turbulence. Many realizations of the simulations are performed {{in order to determine the}} distributions of the resulting orbital elements of the surviving planets, roughly 10000 in all. The action of disk <b>torques</b> and planet-planet <b>scattering</b> results in a distribution of final orbital elements that fills the ae plane, in rough agreement with the orbital elements of observed extrasolar planets. We pair this parametric study with a more in-depth analysis of the disk's effect on orbital eccentricity. Several recent analytic calculations suggest that disk-planet interactions excite eccentricity, while numerical studies generally produce eccentricity damping. We address this controversy using a quasi-analytic approach, removing several approximations from the traditional calculation of disk torques. We encounter neither uniform damping nor uniform excitation of orbital eccentricity, but rather a function de/dt that varies in both sign and magnitude depending on initial solar system properties. Most significantly, we find that for every combination of disk and planet properties investigated herein, corotation torques produce negative values of de/dt for some range in e within the interval [0. 1, 0. 5]. If corotation torques are saturated, this region of eccentricity damping disappears, and excitation occurs on a short timescale of less than 0. 08 Myr. Thus, our study does not produce eccentricity excitation on a timescale of a few Myr [...] we obtain either eccentricity excitation on a short time scale, or eccentricity damping on a longer time scale...|$|R
40|$|Chiral magnets like MnSi form lattices of skyrmions, i. e. {{magnetic}} whirls, which react sensitively {{to small}} electric currents j above a critical current density jc. The interplay of these currents with tiny gradients {{of either the}} magnetic field or the temperature can induce a rotation of the magnetic pattern for j>jc. Either a rotation by a finite angle of up to 15 degree or [...] for larger gradients [...] a continuous rotation with a finite angular velocity is induced. We use Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations extended by extra damping terms in combination with a phenomenological treatment of pinning forces to develop a theory of the relevant rotational <b>torques.</b> Experimental neutron <b>scattering</b> data on the angular distribution of skyrmion lattices suggests that continuously rotating domains are easy to obtain {{in the presence of}} remarkably small currents and temperature gradients.

40|$|The Yarkovsky effect {{describes}} {{a small but}} significant force that affects the orbital motion of meteoroids and asteroids smaller than $ 30 - 40 $ kilometers in diameter. It is caused by sunlight; when these bodies heat up in the Sun, they eventually re-radiate the energy away in the thermal waveband, which in turn creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce measurable orbital changes over decades and substantial orbital effects over millions to billions of years. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that, complemented by a <b>torque</b> produced by <b>scattered</b> sunlight, can modify the rotation rates and obliquities of small bodies as well. This rotational variant has been coined the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. During {{the past decade or}} so, the Yarkovsky and YORP effects have been used to explore and potentially resolve a number of unsolved mysteries in planetary science dealing with small bodies. Here we review the main results to date, and preview the goals for future work. Comment: Chapter to appear in the Space Science Series Book: Asteroids I...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{influence}} of heterogeneous distribution of optical and thermal properties on asteroid surfaces onto the YORP effect. Modelling of the surface heterogeneities is done in three ways. In the first one, we create an impact crater with higher albedo regolith on a regolith-covered asteroid. In the second way, we suppose presence of higher albedo regolith on steep slopes (slope angle > 35 ◦) and in the third one, we state properties of bare rock (with different thermal parameters) in these areas. Then we evaluate {{the influence of}} <b>torques</b> caused by <b>scattered</b> or thermally emitted radiation on 200 asteroids based on different distribution of described parameters by means of statistics. We {{have found that the}} presence of heterogeneities caused by landslides on asteroid surfaces does not significantly affect the YORP effect with two exceptions: a slight inclination to decelerate the rotation in the case of landslides uncovering bare rock due to critical rotation and significant preference for deceleration in the configurations with uncovered higher albedo regolith on steep slopes. Our data suggest that the influence of heterogeneous distribution of optical properties caused by landslides on the value of typical acceleration time, so-called doubling time td, is 2 % and it does not exceed 5 % in the case [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{alignment}} of grains subject to both radiative torques and pinwheel torques while accounting for thermal flipping of grains. By pinwheel torques {{we refer to}} all systematic torques that are fixed in grain body axes, including the radiative <b>torques</b> arising from <b>scattering</b> and absorption of isotropic radiation. We discuss new types of pinwheel torques, which are systematic torques arising from infrared emission and torques arising from the interaction of grains with ions and electrons in hot plasma. We show that both types of torques are long-lived, i. e. may exist longer than gaseous damping time. We compare these torques with the torques introduced by E. Purcell, namely, torques due to H 2 formation, the variation of accommodation coefficient for gaseous collisions and photoelectric emission. Furthermore, we revise the Lazarian & Draine model for grain thermal flipping. We calculate mean flipping timescale induced by Barnett and nuclear relaxation for both paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains, {{in the presence of}} stochastic torques associated with pinwheel torques, e. g. the stochastic torques arising from H 2 formation, and gas bombardment. We show that the combined effect of internal relaxation and stochastic torques can result in fast flipping for sufficiently small grains and, because of this, they get thermally trapped, i. e. rotate thermally in spite of the presence of pinwheel torques. For sufficiently large grains, we show that the pinwheel torques can increase the degree of grain alignment achievable with the radiative torques by increasing the magnitude of the angular momentum of low attractor points and/or by driving grains to new high attractor points.
