5000|$|Rossignol's best-known {{paper is}} a {{clinical}} trial of HBOT published in 2009, which received widespread media attention. Critics of this research include Steven Novella, who has noted that Rossignol provides HBOT in his clinical practice and therefore [...] "stands to gain personally if its effectiveness is proven." [...] Its methodology was also subject to some criticism, for example by Paul Offit, who argued that [...] "it was possible {{that at least some}} parents could tell whether the treatment was active or not, leading to possible observer bias that was not controlled in the study," [...] in contrast to Rossignol et al.'s claim that the parents in the study did not know whether their child had received real HBOT as opposed to the sham version. In addition, John Gever and Steven Novella noted that this study only measured autistic symptoms for four weeks. Additionally, the Committee for the Advancement of Scientific Skepticism wrote that Rossignol's 2009 study [...] "...measured a baseline level of ASD based on three indices of which has been discredited and then measured the degree of improvement within the two groups. There were no comparisons between the placebo and treatment groups, which is essential to determine if there was any benefit for treatment with HBOT. As a result, no firm conclusions about the usefulness of HBOT in the treatment of ASD can be made {{based on the results of}} this study." [...] Similarly, Aetna released a policy brief on HBOT in which they stated that, in this study, [...] "There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in total score, and in the subscales for speech, sociability, and health," [...] and Richard Mills noted that because [...] "children with autism often struggle with other medical issues," [...] "it is difficult to discern exactly which condition hyperbaric therapy might benefit." [...] In response to this criticism, Rossignol has said that [...] "kids who receive the same number of sessions outside of research settings often remain better for longer the four week period during which their symptoms were monitored in the study," [...] and that [...] "You wouldn't anticipate a physician who wasn't doing hyperbaric-oxygen therapy to actually conduct a study of it. Oftentimes when things are new — and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new finding — the people who do the studies are going to be those who are involved in it to begin with." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{property of}} a knot is a criterion {{that allows us}} to recognize this knot. For example, the trivial knot is the only knot which bounds a disk, whence it is characterized by this property. Thsi does not mean it is easy to recognize the trivial knot, since it might still be difficult to tell whether a given knot bounds a disk or not. In general, characteristic properties of knots are hard to handle. Therefore we usually content ourselves looking at weaker properties of knots, in particular at knot invariants, that allow us to distinguish certain knots from others. Kurt Reidemeister's diagrammatical formulation of knot theor 4 y in his famous book Knotentheorei ([39]) gave rise to a variety of combinatorial knot properties, such as the minimal crossing number, alternation or the Jones polynomial. Some of them do also have a topological interpretation, notably the fundamental group. In the present doctoral thesis I discuss relations between various knot properties, with a special emphasis on quasipositivity. A link is called quasipositive if it has a special braid diagram, namely a product of conjugates of the positive standard generators of the braid group. If this product contains words of the form σi,j = (σi [...] . σj- 2) σj- 1 (σi [...] . σj- 2) - 1 only then we call the link strongly quasipositive. Here σi is the i-th positive standard generator of the braid group. The concept of quasipositive links is due to Lee Rudolph. He showed that every quasipositive link is a transverse C-link, i. e. a transverse intersection of a complex plane curve with the standard sphere S 3 ⊂ C 2. Recently, M. Boileau and S. Orevkov proved the converse, namely, that every transverse C-link is a quasipositive link. However, most of the considerations in my thesis are based upon a diagrammatical point of view. In the first chapter I introduce the class of track knots and, at the same time, a method to construct knots with prescribed unknotting numbers. Track knots are closely related to the class of divide knots, which were introduced by Norert A'Campo and served {{as a starting point for}} my studies in knot theory. Furthermore, track knots share a basic property with quasipositive knots. Actually they are quasipositive, as we shall see in the second chapter. For this purpose I introduce a new diagrammatical description of quasipositive knots. In the third chapter I prove that a knot is positive if and only if it is homogeneous and strongly quasipositive. This result follows quite easily from three famous inequalities due to D. Bennequin, H. Morton and P. Cromwell. The fourth chapter contains the main result of my thesis: any finite number of Vassiliev invariants of a knot can be realized by a quasipositive knot. This is closely related to Lee Rudolph's result which says that any Alexander polynomial of a knot can be realized by a quasipositive knot. Crossing changes play an important part in my thesis, two. They give rise not only to the notion of unknotting numbers, but also to the Gordian complex of knots. The Gordian complex of knots is a simplicial complex whose certex set consists of all the siotopy classes of smooth oriented knots in S 3. An edge of the Gordian complex is a pair of knots of Gordian distance one, i. e. a pair of knots whcih differe by one crossing change. Similarly, an n-simplex is a set of (n+ 1) knots whose pairwise Gordian distance is one. In the fifth chapter I prove that every n-simplex of the Gordian complex of knots is contained in an (n+ 1) -simplex. This is a generalization of M. Hirasawa and Y. Uchida's result, who showed that every edge of the Gordian complex is contained in a simplex of infinite dimension. Further we shall see that a knot of unknotting number two can be unknotted via infinitely many different knots of unknotting number one. The sixth chapter is devoted to the study of a special class of knots, namely arborescent knots arising from plumbing positive and negative Hopf bands along any tree. In particular, I determine the minimal crossing numbers of these knots. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> counterpart to a result of W. B. B. Lickorish and M. B. Thistlethwaite on the minimal crossing number of Montesinos links, i. e. links associated with starshaped trees. At last, some problems appear in the seventh and last chapter. Appendix A contains a table of all quasipositive knots up to ten crossings. Some examples of track knots are presented in Appendix B, while Appendix C contains a table of all special fibered arborescent knots up to ten crossings. Although the succession of the chapters follows a certain logical and chronological order, most of them can be read independently, notably chapters 3 and 6. However, chapter 4 relies upon the diagrammatical description of quasipositive knots presented in chapter 2...|$|E
