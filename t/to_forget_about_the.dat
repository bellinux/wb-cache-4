The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pioneers, {{saying that there are}} none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
40|$|In poor {{as much as}} in rich {{countries}} there is a fear that environmentally sustainable development might be contradictory to development in general and equitable development in particular. There could be indeed a contradiction between environmental and social sustainability, too much care for the environment eventually leading <b>to</b> <b>forgetting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore institutional principles and tools that allow the conciliation between environmental and social sustainability. In this respect we will present human rights based political economy as an institutional tool of this sort. We will show how a human-rights based political economy could at the same time respect ecological sustainability and social equity. One of the reasons for that consists in the fact that within a human-rights based political economy, welfare is not the result of economic growth, as within traditional political economy, but of justice. The main objectives of development will be attained, therefore, not through growth but through redistribution of resources or of access to resources...|$|R

Because of the album's poor sales figures, the singer wanted to produce a third record {{that would be more}} accessible and appealing to listeners: [...] "I make albums primarily to sell them and if I get too far out a lot of people can't relate to it.
