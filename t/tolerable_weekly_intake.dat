This research evaluated the concentrations of cadmium, lead, chromium, and nickel in liver and muscle tissues of Rutilus frisii kutum along the Caspian Sea coasts of northern Iran. Methods: Thirty samples of fishes were taken from five stations (Astara, Rezvanshahr, Anazali, Ramsar, and Tonekabon) during fishing season. An ICP-OES spectrophotometer {{was used to determine}} concentrations of the studied metals. Data was analyzed by SPSS 19 using descriptive statistical index, t test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test; P Ni>Pb>Cd. The results showed statistically significant differences in the concentrations of these metals in liver and muscle tissues (P < 0. 05), but no significant difference was observed between males and females. Conclusion: Based on calculations, the estimated permissible <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intakes</b> (PTWIs) of cadmium (0. 042 and 0. 567 mg) and lead (0. 0021 and 0. 027 mg) in this study are lower than the levels established by the World Health Organization (WHO) (0. 455 mg for cadmium and 1. 625 mg for lead) ...|$|R

It is important for dietary sustenance, and also retains deep social, cultural and economic significance, playing a fundamental role in maintaining group cohesion, transferring cultural knowledge and affirming Indigenous identities. We surveyed approximately 20 % of the Gumbaynggirr Aboriginal community of Nambucca Heads, New South Wales, Australia. This paper explores Gumbaynggirr Connection to Country and engagement in cultural practice. It quantifies fishing efforts and consumption of seafood within the community. We found 95 % of the sample group fish, with the highest rate of fishing being 2 - 3 times a week (27 %). Furthermore, 98 % of participants eat seafood weekly or more frequently, up to more than once a day (24 %). Survey results revealed that Myxus elongatus (Sand mullet) and naturally recruited Saccostrea glomerata (Sydney rock oysters) continue to be important wild resources to the Gumbaynggirr community. Trace metals were measured in M. elongatus and S. glomerata samples collected by community participants in this study. Maximum levels prescribed in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code were not exceeded in the edible tissue for either species, however both species exceeded the generally expected levels for zinc and copper and S. glomerata samples exceeded the generally expected level for selenium. Furthermore the average dietary exposure to trace metals from consuming seafood was calculated for the surveyed population. Trace metal intake was then compared to the provisional <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> prescribed by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives. This process revealed that copper and selenium intake were both within the provisional <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake,</b> while there is no guideline for zinc.

40|$|Food risk {{assessment}} takes account of both toxicological information and estimates of dietary exposure {{of a population}} to the chemical substances in order to evaluate risks for public health (EFSA, FAO, & WHO 2011). To estimate dietary exposure accurately, {{it is essential to}} analyse foods as consumed for the presence and levels of chemical substances. Mercury is a metal that is released into the environment from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Once released, mercury undergoes a series of complex transformations and cycles between atmosphere, ocean and land. The three chemical forms of mercury are (i) elemental or metallic mercury (Hg 0), (ii) inorganic mercury (mercurous (Hg 2 2 +) and mercuric (Hg 2 +) cations) and (iii) organic mercury. Methylmercury {{is by far the most}} common form of organic mercury in the food chain. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established <b>Tolerable</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Intakes</b> (TWIs), or ‘safe levels’, intended to protect consumers from adverse health effects posed by the possible presence of the main forms of mercury found in food: methylmercury and inorganic mercury.

Following these Commission Recommendations, Member States are requested to encourage the active involvement of food and feed business operators on the submission of available data on contaminants in food/feed to EFSA. In this study 117 different samples from 10 food groups according to the FoodEx Level 1, a pan- European food classification system, were analyse to determine the amount of total mercury. The samples were collected during October 2013 -May 2015. Determination was carried in compliance with ISO standard 17025. Total mercury (Hg) was determined in a Direct Mercury Analyser DMA 80 (Milestone Inc.; CT, USA), according to United States Environmental Protection Agency test method 7473 (USEPA, 2007) [2]. We obtained different limits of quantification, according matrices, in a range 0. 5 μg/Kg (grapes and fruit salad) to 13. 8 μg/Kg (popcorn). Analytical quality control was achieved using certified reference material NIST 1566 b oyster tissue and BCR 151 skim milk powder. More than 72 % of the results were below the limit of quantification (LOQ). However, 27. 4 % of the results revealed measurable concentration of mercury.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established <b>Tolerable</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Intakes</b> (TWIs), or ‘safe levels’, intended to protect consumers from adverse health effects posed by the possible presence of the main forms of mercury found in food: methylmercury and inorganic mercury. The collection of analytical data on food and feed is an important task of the European Food Safety Authority - EFSA and an essential component in risk assessment. Following the statements of Regulation (EC) n. º 178 / 2002 Member States (MS) have the responsibility to report to EFSA data produced under the official control of food and feed. Following these Commission Recommendations, Member States are requested to encourage the active involvement of food and feed business operators on the submission of available data on contaminants in food/feed to EFSA. To monitor total mercury occurrence in infant foods, we measured the concentrations of Hg in 31 different products from 4 food groups available on Portuguese market (10 purees and fruit juices, 12 cereals, 5 milks and 4 prepared meals). These samples were collected during 2012. Determination was carried in compliance with ISO standard 17025. Total mercury (Hg) was determined in a Direct Mercury Analyser DMA 80 (Milestone Inc.; CT, USA), according to United States Environmental Protection Agency test method 7473 (USEPA, 2007). We obtained a range 0. 9 to 8. 6 μg/Kg, for the limit of quantification. Analytical quality control was achieved using certified reference material BCR 151 skim milk powder and NIST 1566 b oyster tissue. More than 95 % of the results were below the limit of detection (LOD) or the limit of quantification (LOQ). However, 3. 2 % of the results revealed low concentrations.

Also, the contribution of margarines enriched with LC n - 3 PUFA was assessed. Design Published nutrient and contaminant data were used in a probabilistic model to calculate the simultaneous nutrient and contaminant intake for different fish consumption scenarios. Results The Belgian recommendation for EPA + DHA (0 · 3 % of total energy intake) {{can be reached by}} consuming fatty fish a minimum of twice a week, or by varying between lean and fatty fish a minimum of three times a week. At this fish consumption level, MeHg intake is not an issue of toxicological concern. The intake of dioxin-like compounds approximates the TWI when consuming fatty fish more than twice a week, this being a potential toxicological risk because other food items also contribute to the weekly intake of dioxin-like compounds. Use of margarine enriched with LC n - 3 PUFA can help to increase LC n - 3 intake, on average by 159 mg/d. Conclusions Combination of regular fish consumption (twice a week) with important contribution of fatty fish species, in combination with regular consumption of margarine enriched with EPA + DHA, can be advised to achieve the recommendation for LC n - 3 intake. </p...|$|E

Design: Published nutrient and contaminant data were used in a probabilistic model to calculate the simultaneous nutrient and contaminant intake for different fish consumption scenarios. Results: The Belgian recommendation for EPA + DHA (0. 3 % of total energy intake) {{can be reached by}} consuming fatty fish a minimum of twice a week, or by varying between lean and fatty fish a minimum of three times a week. At this fish consumption level, MeHg intake is not an issue of toxicological concern. The intake of dioxin-like compounds approximates the TWI when consuming fatty fish more than twice a week, this being a potential toxicological risk because other food items also contribute to the weekly intake of dioxin-like compounds. Use of margarine enriched with LC n- 3 PUFA can help to increase LC n- 3 intake, on average by 159 mg/d. Conclusions: Combination of regular fish consumption (twice a week) with important contribution of fatty fish species, in combination with regular consumption of margarine enriched with EPA + DHA, can be advised to achieve the recommendation for LC n- 3 intake...|$|E
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/DFs) {{are still}} an {{environmental}} problem in Sweden, although {{the use and}} production of PCBs have been banned for decades {{and the release of}} PCDD/DFs have decreased significantly. In general, the concentrations in food have declined since the 1970 s. However, in fish from some parts of the Baltic Sea, the decline of PCBs and PCDD/DFs appears to have ceased in the 1990 s (Bignert, 2002). For risk assessment purposes, the Swedish National Food Administration has conducted a fish survey 2000 - 2002 of levels of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs), PCBs, PCDD/DFs and persistent pesticides, in fish from the Baltic Sea region. Also polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), ubiquitously used flame retardants, have been added to this list because of results suggesting the PBDE group as candidate for a new environmental hazard. The aim is to get relevant data {{to be used in the}} continuous evaluation of the dietary recommendations and to follow changes in the levels of these environmental contaminants in fish. The ambition is to use the data as a basis for intake estimations for human body burdens and compare with internationally established <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intakes</b> (TWI). In addition, in November 2001, the European Commission (EC) published legislation aimed at achieving a reduction in human exposure to PCDD/DFs and PCBs (Council Regulation 2375 / 01 /EC). One of the strategies to reduce the human exposure for PCDD/DFs and dioxin-like PCBs has been to set maximum levels for PCDD/DFs in foodstuffs. Sweden and Finland currently have a derogation from the Council regulation that allows national marketing of fish that exceed the maximum level for PCDD/DF. The legislation came into force from 1 July 2002. The Council Regulation also carries with it an obligation for Member States to monitor the levels of dioxin-like PCBs and PCDD/DFs in foodstuffs and to report the levels to the EC. These data will ultimately be used to both review the maximum limits and measure the effectiveness of the reduction strategy and set new maximum limits. For example, during 2004 the Commission is planning to set maximum levels for dioxin-like PCBs based on reported background levels from the member states. The following report includes results from parts of the sampling carried out in the Baltic Sea area in 2000 - 2002. Only results of PCBs, persistent pesticides, PBDEs and HBCD are reported here. The corresponding PCDD/DF levels are reported on www. slv. se in three interim reports...|$|R
40|$|Dioxins and {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) are {{environmental}} contaminants that are mostly taken {{in through the}} consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. Because of their long residence time in the body {{as well as their}} toxic properties, human exposure to these sub-stances should be reduced as much as possible. The consumption of freshwater fish consti-tutes a special entry path of these substances as the fish may exhibit high levels of dioxins and PCBs resulting from contaminated bodies of water which the fish inhabit and from which they are caught. Commercially available fish may (with the exception of eel) contain a maxi-mum of 8 picograms (8 pg = 0. 000 000 000 008 g) of so-called dioxin equivalents per gram of fish. However, such concentrations are scarcely detected in commercial fish. However, anglers and their families constitute a special risk group as they prepare and con-sume self-caught freshwater fish from bodies of water that are more contaminated. BfR on principle considers that the same protective aims apply to anglers and their families as those that apply to other consumers. This means that they should also not consume fish that contains dioxin and PCB exceeding the maximum levels in force. The <b>weekly</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>intake</b> amount of 14 pg dioxin equivalents (WHO-TEQ) /kg body weight (BW) should therefore in no case be exceeded {{over a longer period of}} time...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Cadmium, lead, mercury and chromium concentrations in fish muscle tissue taken from various Sicilian areas were detected. Fish caught in Siracusa, nearby a petrochemical industrial area, were more contaminated by cadmium, lead and chromium (respectively 0. 366, 0. 32, 0. 72 lg/g) {{than those from}} the other sites. In the Sicily Channel, we found the highest bioaccumulation of mercury (0. 31 lg/g).

40|$|This article proposes {{statistical}} {{tools for}} quantitative {{evaluation of the}} risk due {{to the presence of}} some particular contaminants in food. We focus on the estimation of the probability of the exposure to exceed the so-called provisional <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> (PTWI), when both consumption data and contamination data are independently available. A Monte Carlo approximation of the plug-in estimator, which may be seen as an incomplete generalized U-statistic, is investigated. We obtain the asymptotic properties of this estimator and propose several confidence intervals, based on two estimators of the asymptotic variance: (i) a bootstrap type estimator and (ii) an approximate jackknife estimator relying on the Hoeffding decomposition of the original U-statistics. As an illustration, we present an evaluation of the exposure to Ochratoxin A in France...|$|E
