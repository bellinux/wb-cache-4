5|$|The German {{destroyer}} Z1 Leberecht Maass was {{the lead}} ship of her class of four destroyers built for the German Navy (initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed as the Kriegsmarine in 1935) during the mid-1930s. Completed in 1937, <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> start of World War II, the ship served as a flagship {{and spent most of}} her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939.|$|E
5|$|The first Su-27K prototype, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov, {{made its}} maiden flight on 17 August 1987 at the NITKA facility; the second {{followed}} on 22 December. Flight tests continued at NITKA, where Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks demonstrated and validated {{the feasibility of}} ski-jump operations. The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Tbilisi, subsequently renamed Admiral Kuznetsov, left the shipyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{railways}} {{arrived on}} Anglesey {{with the construction}} of the Chester and Holyhead Railway, of which the section from Llanfairpwll to Holyhead opened in 1848, <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Britannia Bridge was finished. The Chester and Holyhead railway surveyed a branch to Llangefni in 1852, but chose not to proceed. George Stephenson notably reported that the line was not worth building.|$|E

5|$|Columbia {{distributed}} Disney's shorts for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Disney studio {{entered a}} new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process, which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not. The result was the Silly Symphony Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor. Flowers and Trees was a major success, and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.|$|E
5|$|Garcia {{pitched a}} 10-hit {{complete}} game on June 4, 1951 in an 8–2 Cleveland win, helping the Indians beat New York Yankees pitcher Ed Lopat {{for the first}} time in <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> game, Lopat's record was 8–0 on the season. Garcia improved his season mark to 5–3. On August 7 against the St. Louis Browns, Garcia reached a career-high 15 wins. In a 5–1 victory, he also recorded his second career home run. Garcia won 20 games in 1951 and finished fifth in the AL with six saves.|$|E

5|$|The first World Cup was {{organised}} in England in June 1975, {{with the}} first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have {{appeared}} from beneath Manhattan and decimated the city. To fight back against the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> game's events.

5|$|The venue {{opened in}} 1916 and was {{originally}} used for football, athletics and speed skating. The club house {{was completed in}} 1928 and has since been used for martial arts. From 1929, a velodrome course was installed, which remained in use until 1940. During the 1930s, the venue was the main Oslo stadium for the Workers' Sports Federation (AIF). A speedway course was installed in 1947 and remained in use until 1968. The venue featured eight ice hockey matches and two bandy matches during the 1952 Winter Olympics. Artificial ice was laid in 1985 and the skating hall opened in 1995, <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> artificial turf was laid.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Zong voyage reached Britain, the ship's owners claimed {{compensation}} from their insurers {{for the loss of}} the slaves. The insurers refused to honour the claim and the owners took them to court. Zongs logbook went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.|$|E
5|$|While Bolton {{finished}} 4th {{the following}} season, the next 20 years {{would prove to}} be a fallow period. The club suffered relegation to the Second Division in 1963–64, and were then relegated again to the Third Division {{for the first time in}} their history in 1970–71. This stay in the Third Division lasted just <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> club were promoted as champions in 1972–73. Hopes were high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E
5|$|Each {{player was}} {{acquired}} by the Canucks through various trades. Once each member arrived in Vancouver it took <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> line played together regularly. Once they did, they helped to set a Canucks franchise record for points in 2002–03 season (later surpassed), a season in which the West Coast Express accounted for 45% of the team's goal production. All three players recorded their most individually recognized and best statistical seasons while playing on the line. Despite regular season success, the Canucks {{were never able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} playoffs during the West Coast Express years. The line was disbanded when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers after the 2005–06 season. Both Morrison and Naslund played through the 2007–08 season with the Canucks before leaving the organization via free agency.|$|E
5|$|Field {{attended}} Macquarie University {{to receive}} training {{in early childhood}} education, and founded The Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher for <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the}} most successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented.|$|E
