Frequency relays {{are one of the most}} commonly used loss of mains detection method. However, distribution utilities may be faced by concern related to false operation of these frequency relays. The commercially available frequency relays reported considering standard <b>tight</b> <b>setting.</b> This paper investigates some factors related to relays internal algorithm that contribute to their different operating responses. The factors that will be investigated are frequency measuring techniques, measuring windows, time delays and under voltage interlock function. With the increasing penetration of DG into the network, it is becoming common to have multiple DG units connected at the same network location. Two generators connected at the same location and employing frequency relays with the same setting but different characteristics were simulated. When subjected to the same network disturbances the possible interference between the two relays is analyzed...|$|E
30|$|The {{mathematical}} {{definition of}} a cell assembly encompasses a variety of <b>tight</b> <b>sets.</b> For instance, in Fig.  1, S is a <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> and any superset of S is also a <b>tight</b> <b>set.</b> Yet, Palm proposed that a minimal persistent <b>set</b> is a <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> [19]. Therefore, {{we focus on the}} study of cell assemblies generated by minimal persistent sets.|$|R

Let X be a set of points of HS(9,q) and let N 1 denote {{the total number of}} ordered pairs of distinct collinear points of HS(9,q) belonging to X. Using the extended Higman–Sims technique we will derive an upper and lower bound for N 1 in terms of ∣X∣. Sets of points attaining these bounds are respectively called <b>tight</b> <b>sets</b> of Type I and <b>tight</b> <b>sets</b> of Type II. We provide examples of <b>tight</b> <b>sets</b> which are related to HS(7,q) -subspaces and 1 - and 2 -systems of Q+(9,q). We show that the size of the intersection of a <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> X of Type I and a <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> Y of Type II only depends on ∣X∣ and ∣Y∣. We characterize <b>tight</b> <b>sets</b> by means of this property...|$|R

30|$|The {{definition}} of a cell assembly tells us that it only takes {{a fraction of the}} assembly to get excited in order to excite the entire assembly. However, the motivation and focus of our work comes from the study of cell assemblies generated by <b>tight</b> <b>sets</b> that are minimal, that is, the deletion of any node from the set generates a subset that is not tight. In addition, the mathematical {{definition of}} a cell assembly for its study on simple graphs follows the {{definition of a}} k-core. According to Palm’s definition of a <b>tight</b> <b>set,</b> a particular type of <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> is a minimal k-core. Hence, the vertex set of a minimal k-core generates a particular type of cell assembly called k-assembly.|$|R

Penttila, <b>Tight</b> <b>sets</b> and m-ovoids of generalised quadrangles, Combinatorica, in press] as a unification of the pre-existing notions of <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> and m-ovoid. It was shown in [J. Bamberg, M. Law, T. Penttila, <b>Tight</b> <b>sets</b> and m-ovoids of generalised quadrangles, Combinatorica, in press] that every intriguing {{set of points}} in a finite generalised quadrangle is a <b>tight</b> <b>set</b> or an m-ovoid (for some m). Moreover, it was shown that an m-ovoid and an i-tight set of a common generalised quadrangle intersect in mi points. These results yielded new proofs of old results, and in this paper, we study the natural analogue of intriguing sets in finite polar spaces of higher rank. In particular, we use the techniques developed in this paper to give an alternative proof of a result of Thas [J. A. Thas, Ovoids and spreads of finite classical polar spaces, Geom. Dedicata 10 (1 – 4) (1981) 135 – 143] {{that there are no}} ovoids of H(2 r,q 2), Q−(2 r+ 1,q), and W(2 r− 1,q) for r> 2. We also strengthen a result of Drudge on the non-existence of <b>tight</b> <b>sets</b> in W(2 r− 1,q), H(2 r+ 1,q 2), and Q+(2 r+ 1,q), and we give a new proof of a result of De Winter, Luyckx, and Thas [S. De Winter, J. A. Thas, SPG-reguli satisfying the polar property and a new semipartial geometry, Des. Codes Cryptogr. 32 (1 – 3) (2004) 153 – 166; D. Luyckx, m-Systems of finite classical polar spaces, PhD thesis, The University of Ghent, 2002] that an m-system of W(4 m+ 3,q) or Q−(4 m+ 3,q) is a pseudo-ovoid of the ambient projective space...|$|R
