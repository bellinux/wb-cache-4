5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the {{structure}} and use of metaphors are two connected entities toward the overall progression within the sonnet. Seen as a harsh critic on age, Shakespeare sets up {{the negative effects of}} aging in the three quatrains of this poem. These aspects not only take on a universal aspect from the symbols, but represent the inevitability of a gradual lapse in the element of time in general from their placement in the poem. Further, many of <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> utilized in this sonnet were personified and overwhelmed by this connection between the speaker's youth and death bed. This inevitability leads to the purpose and transformation experienced from our author by the final lines of the poem. A deeper appreciation for his lover in spite of his narcissistic views toward death serves as the overall rationale behind Sonnet 73.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{collection}} of four tantras which comprise the basis of Traditional Tibetan Medicine. It is divided into the Root Tantra (rtsa rgyud), The Explanatory Tantra (bshe rgyud), The Oral-instruction Tantra (man ngag rgyud), and The Subsequent Tantra (phyi ma rgyud). The Root Tantra has six chapters and gives (1) an introduction, (2) general outline of topics, (3) the basis of disease, (4) diagnosis, (5) methods of treatment, and (6) an enumeration of <b>the</b> <b>metaphors</b> used in Traditional Tibetan Medicine. The Explanatory Tantra is divided into eleven divisions and thirty-one chapters, and covers (1) a summary of fundamentals, (2) the life cycle, (3) fundamentals of pathology, (4) behavior and lifestyle, (5) diet, (6) pharmacology, (7) tools of the physician, (8) health and prevention, (9) diagnosis, (10) method of treatment, and (11) ethics of a physician. The Oral-instruction Tantra has fifteen divisions that are explained in ninety-two chapters; the divisions include (1) pathology of the three humors, (2) internal disorders, (3) fever, (4)pathology of the upper parts of the body, (5) pathology of the solid and hollow organs, (6) genital disorders, (7) common diseases, (8) dermatology, (9) pediatrics, (10) gynecological disorders, (11) disorders caused by spirit provocation, (12) injury, (13) toxicology, (14) longevity, and (15) aphrodisiacs. The Subsequent Tantra has four topics in twenty-five chapters, including (1) diagnosis, (2) pharmacological formulae, (3) purifying therapies, and (4) external therapies.|$|E

40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to exploring <b>the</b> process of <b>metaphor</b> comprehension. There {{are a number of}} cognitive theories addressing this issue, including <b>the</b> conceptual <b>metaphor</b> theory (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980), the salience imbalance theory (Ortony, 1979), the structure mapping theory (Gentner, 1983), the domain-interaction theory (Tourangeau and Sternberg, 1982), the attributive categorization theory (Glucksberg and Keysar, 1990) and the conceptual blending theory (Fauconnier and Turner, 1998, 2002). A critical review of these theories and their supportive empirical studies have revealed that all of them are in a degree applicable to explaining the comprehension of certain metaphors but not capable of working with the processing of others. What are the major factors that drive different mappings to be involved in processing different <b>metaphors</b> and affect <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> comprehension? This is the major question to be investigated in this research. Inspired by recent studies, a hypothesis is formulated: the cognitive processing mechanisms in comprehending a metaphor are largely influenced by the addressees’ pre-existing conceptual knowledge as reflected in their estimation of the conventionality and the aptness of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> and <b>the</b> communicative context in which <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> arises. To test this hypothesis, a cross-cultural web-based experiment has been carried out to explore how three metaphors are comprehended under various role-play conditions by subjects whose pre-existing conceptual knowledge concerning these metaphors varies from each other. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>The</b> teacher is a candle was estimated by the Chinese subjects as the most conventional and apt teacher <b>metaphor</b> but <b>the</b> German subjects estimated it as a less conventional and less apt <b>metaphor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>The</b> teacher is a shepherd was estimated by the German subjects as the most conventional and apt, but by the Chinese subjects as less conventional and less apt. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>The</b> teacher is a captain was estimated by both Chinese and German subjects as a less conventional but apt metaphor. Under various role-play conditions (no role play, after the role play scenario with the positive development or after the role play with the negative development), the Chinese and the German participants were first asked to rate their affective impressions of <b>the</b> teacher <b>metaphors</b> on dimensions of the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) (Lang, 1980). Then they were required to rate how suitable thirty-three features selected from a pilot study are in describing <b>the</b> teacher <b>metaphors.</b> Altogether 180 complete valid data sets were collected from the participants from two German universities and two Chinese universities. The multivariate analysis of the SAM ratings and the cluster analysis and the network analysis of the feature ratings are summarized as follows: First, a greater consensus in both the SAM ratings and the feature ratings was shared among the subjects who regarded <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> as conventional and apt than those who regarded it as unconventional and inapt. Second, significant positive correlations between the topic and the vehicle concept were found in subjects’ SAM and feature ratings of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> that they regarded as conventional and apt. In contrast, their SAM ratings and feature ratings of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor,</b> which they regarded as unconventional and inapt, shows no positive correlation between the topic and the vehicle of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor.</b> Instead, there was a tendency of high rating emergent features. Third, context exerted significant influence on subjects’ SAM and feature ratings. When <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> was provided in the role play with the positive development, a greater consensus in rating the SAM and the features appeared among the subjects who took <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> as unconventional and inapt. When <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> was provided under the condition of the role play with negative development, even the subjects who originally regarded <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> as conventional and apt seemed to lose their consensus in rating the SAM and the features. Such results largely confirm the hypothesis of the experiment and reveal that the comprehension of a metaphor is not a static process but rather a dynamic one that can be affected by both the pre-existing conceptual knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> addressee and <b>the</b> context in which <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> arises. Based on the empirical findings, a dynamic theoretical view is formulated to explain <b>the</b> comprehension of <b>metaphor</b> through <b>the</b> integration of Wilson and Sperber’s (2004) relevance theory, Cowan’s (2005) working memory theory and relevant cognitive mapping theories. According to this view, <b>the</b> comprehension of <b>metaphors</b> can be segmented into various situations with the emphasis on the interplay of the addressee’s conceptual knowledge and the communicative context in which <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> appears. Depending on people‘s conceptual knowledge preexisting in their long-term memory and the communicative context in which a <b>metaphor</b> appears, <b>the</b> comprehension of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> involves testing <b>the</b> contextual metaphoric assumption that is formulated through the ad-hoc interplay of the topic space, the vehicle space, and the contextual space generated in people‘s working memory. The more conventional and apt <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> appears to them, the less complicated are the mappings involved in drawing the contextual metaphoric assumption needed for comprehending <b>the</b> <b>metaphor.</b> This dynamic view of metaphor comprehension can explain why the German subjects had more difficulty than the Chinese subjects in comprehending <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> <b>The</b> teacher is a candle in this experiment. It can also provide a good solution to solve the debate among <b>the</b> current <b>metaphor</b> mapping theories and synthesize them in a plausible way. Furthermore, this cognitive metaphor research also suggests follow-up studies should be done in order to develop further the present dynamic view into a well-structured model of metaphor comprehension...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{creativity}} and design {{by way of}} metaphor. It maps out the act of designing and considers dynamic forces that engender ways of living differently. Conception: The overall concept is for a book that articulates an extended metaphor through its volume, design and content. <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> targets all that is inexpressible about designing. It is an experimental and imaginative exercise that solves an ethics of encounter conducted through a micro-politics of daily activism. Milieu: <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> considers everyday situations and specific circumstances that are constituted by the actual occasions of designing. It explores the nexus at which designing is concentrated and traces outwards to determine the horizons of their milieu. Assemblage: The assemblage of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> is <b>the</b> dynamic territory for creating, organizing and fitting together sensational and affective images of life-changing events. Account: The bound account of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> forms visual and conceptual signs of designing into discussion and diagrams that negotiate the difficulty of both living and accounting for events. Dynamic: A cartographic approach surveys the image of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> for indications {{of the problems that}} motivate its designing. Design: The design of <b>the</b> <b>metaphor</b> allows it to fold and unfold complexes of components that do not always connect directly but are always in communication with each other. Resolution: <b>The</b> <b>metaphor</b> crystallizes an image of a particulate instance of designing in which its binaries, living by design and designing by event, intersect...|$|R
