T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences.
