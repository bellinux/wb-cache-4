For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board {{and there is no}} neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

In July 2014, on the announcement of the title of the episode, several media outlets incorrectly presumed that Krusty would die. The choice of character to die was deemed by some critics as anti-climactic due to Rabbi Krustofski's minor role in the show, although other reviewers praised its conclusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Krusty and his father.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E

25|$|Brill-Zinsser disease, first {{described}} by Nathan Brill in 1913 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, is a mild form of epidemic typhus which recurs in someone {{after a long}} period of latency (similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> chickenpox and shingles). This recurrence often occurs in times of relative immunosuppression, which is often in the context of malnutrition and other illnesses.

25|$|Computationalism is the {{position}} {{in the philosophy of}} mind that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.
