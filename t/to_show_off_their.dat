5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue for auto companies <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E

25|$|Several factors led to {{concerns}} about the CS:GO skins market and gambling. The skin gambling mechanisms work towards those predisposed to gambling because of the ready-availability and acquirability of skins within the game, and can earn great rewards, according to UCLA's co-director of gambling studies Timothy Wayne Fong This is particularly true for younger players, which make up {{a substantial portion of}} the CS:GO player base, who also may be encouraged through peer pressure to obtain unique skins <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> friends.|$|R

50|$|The tau'olunga is a {{dance for}} virgins, {{especially}} for them <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> at <b>their</b> wedding day. But {{it can be}} danced at any special occasion. Often it is performed by {{a small group of}} girls, up to 10 or so. It is rare for a married, or any older woman to dance it. It is even rarer, but not impossible, to be performed by men. However, men can assist the dancing girl by mimicking her movements in an exaggerated and clownesque way, which is supposed to make her beauty more striking. The assistance of older women is usually limited to only handclaps on the rhythm of the music. This role is called the tuulafale.|$|R
25|$|The 1529 {{campaign}} produced mixed results. Buda {{was brought}} {{back under the}} control of the Ottoman vassal John Zápolya, strengthening the Ottoman position in Hungary. The campaign left behind a trail of collateral damage in neighbouring Habsburg Hungary and Austria that impaired Ferdinand's capacity to mount a sustained counter-attack. However, Suleiman failed to force Ferdinand to engage him in open battle, and was thus unable to enforce his ideological claim to superiority over the Habsburgs. The attack on Vienna led to a rapprochement between Charles V and Pope Clement VII, and contributed to the Pope's coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor on February 24, 1530. The outcome of the campaign was presented as a success by the Ottomans, who used the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> imperial grandeur by staging elaborate ceremonies for the circumcision of princes Mustafa, Mehmed, and Selim.|$|E
25|$|Great grey shrikes breed {{during the}} summer, {{typically}} once per year. In exceptionally good conditions, they raise two broods a year, {{and if the}} first clutch is destroyed before hatching they are usually able to produce a second one. Their monogamous pair bond is strong during the breeding season and loosens over winter; birds often choose a different mate than the year before. To seek out potential mates, males will venture outside their breeding territories. If a female thus encountered finds a male to her liking, she will visit {{to see whether they}} get along well and inspect the nesting sites he can offer. The courtship period is generally longer than in the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), usually starting about March and lasting to April/May. At first, the female rebuffs the male, only allowing him to feed her. Males give increasingly vocal displays and show off the white markings of the wings in flight and of the tail by fanning it and turning away from the female. He also occasionally turns to sit at a right angle to her. Eventually, the female will join in the male's displays, and the songs will become duets. To feed females and <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> hunting prowess, males will make their food caches in conspicuous places during this time. When presenting nesting sites, males give the variety of calls described above and jerk their head and fanned tail.|$|E

Mumbai FC then set about their goals in which they {{wanted to build a}} strong first team, build a good youth development program which would serve as the platform in the ladder to the first-team for potential youngsters, build a good football culture in Mumbai, and develop the football infrastructure in Mumbai. The club started building their team straight away with the signing of Englishmen David Booth. The team then started making some major signings in Indian internationals Abhishek Yadav, Khalid Jamil, Noel Wilson, and Kalyan Chaubey along with potential youngsters Dane Pereira and Darren Caldeira. The team then added their first round of foreign players Felix Aboagye and James Dissiramah. The club then began their grassroots project in November 2007 with Aqueel Ansari being the head coach. Mumbai FC then participated in their first tournament, the Mumbai Football League Elite Division in 2007. Mumbai FC lost their match in the Mumbai Football League to RCF 2–1 with Dane Pereira scoring the first goal. Mumbai FC then won the first match in their history against Bengal Mumbai; in their second match, won 7–0 with Abhishek Yadav scoring four goals. The club then won their first-ever championship, the Abhijit Kadam Memorial Cup, in which Mumbai defeated then I-League club Vasco. The club then finished in second place in the Mumbai Football League Elite Division behind I-League club Mahindra United.|$|E
50|$|The {{visitors}} of a demoparty often {{bring their}} own computers <b>to</b> compete and <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>their</b> works. <b>To</b> this end, most parties provide a large hall with tables, electricity and usually a local area network connected to the Internet. In this respect, many demoparties resemble LAN parties, {{and many of the}} largest events also gather gamers and other computer enthusiasts in addition to demosceners. A major difference between a real demoparty and a LAN party is that demosceners typically spend more time socializing (often outside the actual party hall) than in front of their computers.|$|R

X-ONE Magazine calls the game an [...] "unashamed clone of Diablo", which borrows mechanics, naming conventions, and character archetypes from Diablo. The gameplay was considered by critics to be too easy, with a terrible enemy AI that made combat unchallenging, interspersed with what Henry Kelly called [...] "painfully simple non-puzzles". Other components that faced criticism included the shallowness of the RPG elements, the lack of online co-op, and the dialogue, which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted.|$|E

40|$|SUBMISSION ID: 1008 The {{development}} of a computer game is widely used {{as a means to}} convey Computer Sciences concepts. There are several reasons for that: it is stimulates creativity, it provides an immediate sense of achievement when the code works, it typically covers all the aspects of an introductory course, it is easy to find ideas just looking around. In this paper we present NVMC (EnVy My Car), a framework for collaborative/competitive {{development of}} a computer game and report the experience in using it in two computer graphics courses held in the year 2007 by the authors. We developed a multiplayer car racing game where the student is only asked to implement the rendering of the scene, while all the other aspects, communication and synchronization are implemented in the framework and transparent to the developer. The novelty of our framework is that all the clients on-line are able to see the views provided by the other clients, which serves to motivate the students to improve their work by comparing it with the other clients, as a means to pick up ideas from the others and finally <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> with <b>their</b> classmates...|$|R
