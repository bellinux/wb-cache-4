40|$|This chapter {{considers}} market-based banking in more empirical depth across eleven countries. It {{argues that}} levels of market-based banking {{are now a}} more useful way to compare national banking systems and serve, when combined {{with a focus on}} other market sources of non-financial corporation (NFC) financing, to provide an alternative to the standard dichotomy of bank-based and market-based financial systems. The chapter considers the degree of market-based assets and liabilities in banks in the eleven banking systems and highlights the differences between systems. It demonstrates how this detail helps explain the differential impact of the financial crisis in terms of timing, the required levels of government support to banking systems, and the impact of the crisis on lending <b>to</b> <b>NFCs...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper gives a {{comprehensive}} analysis of security with respect <b>to</b> <b>NFC.</b> It {{is not limited}} to a certain application of NFC, but it uses a system-atic approach to analyze the various aspects of security whenever an NFC in-terface is used. The authors want to clear up many misconceptions about se-curity and NFC in various applications. The paper lists the threats, which are applicable <b>to</b> <b>NFC,</b> and describes solutions to protect against these threats. All of this is given in the context of currently available NFC hardware, NFC applications and possible future developments of NFC. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper are twofold: first, develop a novel concept of a mobiquitous home {{application}} (Near Field Communication Smartphone Entertainment Systems (NFC SES)) with the use of photo interface and NFC smartphone. Second, examine age-group differences in relation to the influence of intuitive, convenience and perceived usefulness on users’ behavioural intention <b>to</b> use <b>NFC</b> SES. Design/methodology/approach – Using design science research, NFC SES is developed and a survey of 52 users is conducted <b>to</b> evaluate <b>NFC</b> SES. Findings – There are age differences in individual behavioural intention <b>to</b> use <b>NFC</b> technology. Convenience appears to be the primary factor for the youths. The adult cohort, in contrast emphasizes intuitive and perceived usefulness as two significant determinants of their behavioural intention <b>to</b> use <b>NFC</b> SES...|$|R

40|$|NFC is a {{relatively}} new short-range wireless technology. For bidirectional communication between two NFC devices, the NFC Forum specifies the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) standard. Several challenges remain for exchanging data between a mobile Android device and an embedded device. First of all, the current versions of Android implement the NFC P 2 P specification only partially. A second challenge is the implementation of the NFC P 2 P protocol stack on the embedded platform. For the developers {{to be able to make}} an educated choice on whether <b>to</b> use <b>NFC</b> (P 2 P) or not, knowledge of the data rate is essential as well. In this article we provide an overview of these challenges. We also create a representative setup with NFC P 2 P stacks according to the specification on both the mobile and the embedded device. With this setup we are able <b>to</b> measure the <b>NFC</b> P 2 P data rate and compare it <b>to</b> <b>NFC</b> connection handover <b>to</b> WiFi. <b>NFC</b> is {{a relatively}} new short-range wireless technology.

5000|$|Operation at low {{frequencies}} faces challenges as well. In general, antennas are most efficient at frequencies whose wavelengths {{are comparable to}} the antennas' dimensions (e.g., a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna). Therefore, since higher frequencies have smaller wavelengths, high frequency antennas are typically smaller than low frequency antennas. The larger size of practically efficient low frequency antennas is a significant hurdle that near-field electromagnetic ranging systems cannot overcome without decreasing gain. Applying fractal antennae <b>to</b> <b>NFC</b> requires complex adaptive controls ...|$|R
