500|$|Despite {{the growing}} tension, Haynes {{remained}} a member and Betts returned. Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live. [...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, {{and there was no}} reason to think otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E

[...] Bill Laswell also returned to contribute on this record, and his production work on this and on the following record, Pure, would heavily influence Laswell's own remix work of the late 90's, as seen on the CDs Emerald Ather and City of Light. [...] The album also contains the first cover song since Blast of Silence, an ethereal, drum-machine-laced re-interpretation of Jackson Browne's [...] "These Days".

2500|$|Drunk with Passion {{marked the}} first album not on Celluloid Records, taking cues {{from some of the}} darker sounds heard on A Dead Horse and using more {{processed}} and electronic sounds, giving some of its songs an ethereal feel. [...] This album is arguably more influenced by its guest appearances than are any of the previous albums. Guests included Hüsker Dü's Bob Mould (who would go on to form the band Sugar the following year), Richard Thompson, and Michael Stipe, who would provide (along with a forceful solo by Thompson) one of the band's finer moments, the opening track [...] "Alive and Living Now". [...] Nicky Skopelitis would also become more of a cornerstone of the band, contributing to the bulk of Drunk with Passions songs along with Fier and Kramer. In 1992, Fier would release his first solo record, Dreamspeed, which is partially a reworking of the Palomino's next album, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>How</b> <b>It</b> Feels.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] This {{has to do with a}} distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was summed up in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Jehudah {{taught that}} the three Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob made {{covenants}} {{with the people of}} the Land of Israel. In Abraham's case, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened: When the three angels visited him (as reported in [...] ), Abraham ran to meet them and prepare for them a great banquet. He told Sarah to prepare cakes for them, but when Sarah was kneading, she perceived that the manner of women was upon her, so Abraham did not serve his visitors any of the cakes. Rather, Abraham ran to fetch a calf, but the calf fled from him and went into the cave of Machpelah. Abraham chased in after the calf, and found Adam and Eve lying there upon their beds. Lights were kindled above them, and a sweet scent was upon them. Abraham consequently sought to get the cave as a burial possession. He spoke to the sons of Jebus to purchase the cave from them. The men did not accept his request at first. He began to bow down and prostrate himself to them, as [...] reports, [...] "And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land." [...] They told Abraham that they knew that in the future God would give all the land to Abraham and his descendants. Thus, they asked Abraham to make a covenant with them that Abraham's descendants would not take possession of the cities of the Jebusites, and they would sell him the cave of Machpelah as a perpetual possession. So Abraham made a covenant with them with an oath that the Israelites would not take possession of the city of the Jebusites (Jerusalem) without the consent of the Jebusites and then bought the cave of Machpelah as a perpetual possession, as [...] reports, [...] "And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant." [...] The Jebusites made images of copper inscribed with Abraham's covenant, and set them up in the streets of the city. When the Israelites later came to the land, they wished to enter the city of the Jebusites (as reported in [...] and [...] ), but they were unable to enter because of the sign of Abraham's covenant, as [...] reports, [...] "And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem." [...] When David reigned, he wanted to enter the city of the Jebusites, but they did not allow him, as [...] reports, [...] "And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; who spoke to David, saying, ‘You shall not come in here.'" [...] Although the Israelites were numerous, they were unable to capture the city because of the force of the sign of Abraham's covenant. David saw this and turned back, as [...] reports, [...] "And David dwelt in the stronghold" [...] (not in the city). David's men told him {{that he would not be}} able to enter the city until he had removed all those images upon which Abraham's covenant was written. So David told his men that whoever would remove those images would be the chief. Joab the son of Zeruiah did so and became the chief, as [...] reports, [...] "And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief." [...] Thereafter, David bought the city of the Jebusites for Israel with a deed for a perpetual possession, as [...] reports, [...] "So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight." ...|$|E
