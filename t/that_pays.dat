5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization <b>that</b> <b>pays</b> the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E

25|$|EDI Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance Set (834) {{can be used}} by employers, unions, {{government}} agencies, associations or insurance {{agencies to}} enroll members to a payer.

25|$|A {{credit card}} is {{different}} from a charge card, where it requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card also differs from a cash card, {{which can be used}} like currency by the owner of the card. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity <b>that</b> <b>pays</b> the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.|$|E

5000|$|The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states: [...] "Steer {{clear of}} {{multilevel}} marketing plans <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> commissions for recruiting new distributors. They're actually illegal pyramid schemes. Why is pyramiding dangerous? Because plans <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> commissions for recruiting new distributors inevitably collapse when no new distributors can be recruited.

25|$|The risk-free asset is the (hypothetical) asset <b>that</b> <b>pays</b> a risk-free rate. In practice, {{short-term}} government securities (such as US treasury bills) {{are used}} as a risk-free asset, because they pay a {{fixed rate of interest}} and have exceptionally low default risk. The risk-free asset has zero variance in returns (hence is risk-free); it is also uncorrelated with any other asset (by definition, since its variance is zero). As a result, when it is combined with any other asset or portfolio of assets, the change in return is linearly related to the change in risk as the proportions in the combination vary.|$|E
25|$|Migrants, {{mostly of}} South Asian origin, {{constitute}} 42.5% of the UAE's workforce and have reportedly {{been subject to}} a range of human rights abuses. Workers have sometimes arrived in debt to recruitment agents from home countries and upon arrival were made to sign a new contract in English or Arabic <b>that</b> <b>pays</b> them less than had originally been agreed, although this is illegal under UAE law. Further to this, some categories of workers have had their passports withheld by their employer. This practice, although illegal, is to ensure that workers do not abscond or leave the country on un-permitted trips.|$|E

[...] "You're watching this on the Internet, a thing <b>that</b> <b>pays</b> us zero dollars," [...] Schur said. [...] "We're supposed to get 11 cents for every two trillion downloads."
