60|$|The Chief Inspector, steady-eyed, nodded briefly his comprehension, {{and opened}} the door. Mrs Verloc, behind the counter, might have heard but did not see his departure, pursued by the {{aggressive}} clatter of the bell. She sat at her post of duty behind the counter. She sat rigidly erect in the chair with two dirty pink pieces of paper lying spread out at her feet. The palms of her hands were pressed convulsively to her face, with {{the tips of the}} fingers contracted against the forehead, as though the skin had been a mask which she was ready to tear off violently. The perfect immobility of her pose expressed the agitation of rage and despair, all the potential violence of tragic passions, better than any shallow display of shrieks, with the beating of a distracted head against the walls, could have done. Chief Inspector Heat, crossing the shop at his busy, swinging pace, gave her only a cursory glance. And when the cracked bell ceased to tremble on its curved ribbon of steel nothing stirred near Mrs Verloc, as if her attitude had the locking power of a spell. Even the butterfly-shaped gas flames posed on the ends of the suspended <b>T-bracket</b> burned without a quiver. In that shop of shady wares fitted with deal shelves painted a dull brown, which seemed to devour the sheen of the light, the gold circlet of the wedding ring on Mrs Verlocâ€™s left hand glittered exceedingly with the untarnished glory of a piece from some splendid treasure of jewels, dropped in a dust-bin.|$|E
40|$|NOVELTY - The panels (1) have {{hard outer}} shells (2, 3) adhered {{continuously}} to, and sandwiching a soft damping layer (4). Edges of the panels have a tongued-and-grooved profile (1 a). Internally, the damping layer or outer shells have profiling offsetting resilient stiffness of the damping layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred features:- The profiles (2 a, 3 a) are swath, trapezoidal, comb or wave formations. One shell is shortened at the top, to assist joint formation (5) with the ceiling. All {{edges of the}} outer shells have a permanently elastic coating (7). The outer shells are hard, e. g. metal, wood, plastics, plasterboard, or sandwich structures of such materials. The sections are joined using cross- or <b>T-brackets</b> (8) {{at the same height}} as the panels. On the connecting edges these have tongue-and-groove profiles congruent with those of the panels. The panels may be constructed as ground- or intermediate flooring, on which only one outer shell and damping layer is provided. USE - A mod ular wall and floor construction system for use within buildings. ADVANTAGE - The prepared edges and joining features assure rapid, simple and reliable construction. Instead of individual fitting of numbers of different types of components, the panels can be cut to size for fitting in one operation...|$|R
