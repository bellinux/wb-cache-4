25|$|At the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson {{discovered}} polyethylene terephthalate, {{known as}} PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and {{also known as}} <b>Terylene</b> or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene (the fabric that is now referred to as polyester). ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Sir Michael Perrin.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, an {{expedition}} starting on the Philippines sailed two modern Wharram-designed catamarans {{loosely based on}} a Polynesian catamaran found in Auckland Museum New Zealand. The boats {{were built in the}} Philippines by an experienced boat builder to Wharram designs using modern strip plank with epoxy resin glue built over plywood frames. The catamarans had modern Dacron sails, <b>Terylene</b> stays and sheets with modern roller blocks. Wharram says he used Polynesian navigation to sail along the coast of Northern New Guinea and then sailed 150 miles to an island for which he had modern charts, proving {{that it is possible to}} sail a modern catamaran along the path of the Lapita Pacific migration. Unlike many other modern Polynesian [...] "replica" [...] voyages the Wharram catamarans were not towed or escorted by a modern vessel with modern GPS navigation system, nor were they fitted with a motor.|$|E
50|$|Crimplene is a texturised {{continuous}} fibre produced by modifying <b>Terylene.</b> The patent {{was taken out}} by Mario Nava of Chesline and Crepes Ltd of Macclesfield, and sold to ICI Fibres. ICI licensed the product to various throwsters. The largest producer by far was William Tatton of Leek, and the Golbourne factory was at one time capable of taking the entire output of ICI's Wilton production of <b>Terylene.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Ian Proctor started {{experimenting with}} metal masts to replace wooden spars in 1952 and <b>Terylene</b> sails arrived in 1954. The minimum weight {{was reduced to}} 80 kg in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Garland {{continued}} {{to act as}} an advisor to industry, working with <b>Terylene</b> and knitwear manufacturers. She was the author/co-author of several books, including The Changing Face of Beauty (1957), The Changing Face of Fashion (1970) and A History of Fashion (1975).|$|E
50|$|The Class {{has never}} been tempted to adopt {{construction}} materials other than wood.Traditionally the sails were made of calico, cotton, and subsequently silk. In recent years <b>Terylene</b> and nylon have been used with the effect that coloured spinnakers are now used by most boats.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Clive {{was chosen}} as {{designer}} of the new BOAC air stewardess uniform, designing a <b>terylene</b> and cotton mini dress in pink or turquoise colourway with streamlined space-age styling.

It was invented by René Malaise in 1934.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s and 30s, {{the company}} {{played a key}} role in the {{development}} of new chemical products, including the dyestuff phthalocyanine (1929), the acrylic plastic Perspex (1932), Dulux paints (1932, co-developed with DuPont), polyethylene (1937), and polyethylene terephthalate fibre known as <b>Terylene</b> (1941).In 1940, ICI started British Nylon Spinners as a joint venture with Courtaulds.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, the BSI {{introduced}} a kite-mark BS 3254 for car seats, and Britax {{was one of}} the first to comply to the standard. In 1960, one of their seatbelts saved Donald Campbell when he crashed at 400 mph. Its belts were made from <b>Terylene</b> (now known as PET) made by ICI. Also in 1960 it bought the Cyclemaster motorcycle company in Byfleet.|$|E

In 1957 he was appointed to the ICI board as Technical Director, and for a short time also served as Development Director.|$|E
50|$|In 1958 the Navy {{announced}} that its new aircraft direction frigate HMS Llandaff {{was to be}} equipped with nylon and <b>Terylene</b> ropes instead of the traditional wire ropes. It was said that commercial shipping had been doing so for some time. Compared with wire they gave much more strength relative to weight, retained flexibility in the cold, withstood sudden shocks, and retained strength in the wet.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of man-made fabrics facilitated {{the development of}} cheap mass-produced clothing from the 1920s onwards, making fashion and a choice of clothing affordable to many women for the first time. There are {{a large number of}} artificial silk and rayon garments that date from the 1920s in the Hodson Shop Collection, with nylon, Orlon, Courtelle, Tricel and <b>terylene</b> being used from the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1930s, {{the company}} had establishments across Scotland and Northern England, {{including}} factories at Billingham and Jarrow, {{as well as in}} Canada, New Zealand, and a large factory in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia. The company branched out into various related lines of business, including the running of an angora rabbit farm in Staffordshire between 1932 and 1934, and the development of new products such as nylon and <b>Terylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|ICI Fibres {{developed}} the Crimplene fibre. It is a thick, polyester yarn {{used to make}} a fabric of the same name. The resulting cloth is heavy, wrinkle-resistant and retains its shape well. Britain's defunct ICI Laboratory {{developed the}} fibre in the early 1950s and named it after the Crimple Valley in which the company was situated.An alternative reason for the name chosen is that is crimped (i.e. bulked up) <b>Terylene.</b>|$|E

5000|$|John Rex Whinfield CBE (16 February 1901 in Sutton, Surrey, England - 6 July 1966 in Dorking, Surrey) was a British chemist who, {{together}} with James Tennant Dickson investigated polyesters and in 1941 produced and patented the first polyester fibre which they named <b>Terylene,</b> {{also known as}} Dacron, equal to or surpassing nylon in toughness and resilience. He was born in Accrington but later moved out of town {{before the age of}} 4 ...|$|E
50|$|The Hōkūlea is {{a modern}} {{interpretation}} of a Polynesian voyaging canoe. It is made from modern materials such as fibreglass, plywood, resin glue, <b>terylene</b> sails and ropes with modern fittings and safety equipment. No authentic Polynesian voyaging canoe has ever been seen although numerous catamaran types were seen by Europeans from the 18th century. Voyaging canoes have crossed the Pacific many times. In most voyages they have been escorted, or towed, by a modern mother ship.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} used for both clothing and accessories changed during this era. Increasingly used were easy-care synthetic fabrics such as Crimplene, Dacron and <b>Terylene.</b> The benefits of such synthetic fabrics were {{that they were}} crease-resistant, easy to wash, and required little to no ironing. Designers such as Cristóbal Balenciaga embraced these new types of materials, using them in oversized dolman-sleeve jackets. The pattern for this piece was cut in a rectangular shape forming a boxy blousy look.|$|E
5000|$|The Millhaven Fibres Plant opened September 28, 1955 as {{the third}} {{polyester}} plant in the world. It was originally built to manufacture {{a new type of}} synthetic yarn called [...] "Terylene" [...] (known as [...] "Dacron" [...] in the United States). [...] "Terylene" [...] polyester fibre was invented in England in 1940 and had wide application in the apparel trade and for industrial use. <b>Terylene,</b> like the plant that manufactured it, underwent a name change and in 1966 became Fortrel.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, the hunt was on for new {{synthetic}} fibres to rival Wallace H. Carothers' nylon. Whinfield {{and his assistant}} James Tennant Dickson investigated other types of polymers with textile fibre potential. Whinfield and Dickson discovered how to condense terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol to yield a new polymer which could be drawn into a fibre. Whinfield and Dickson patented their invention in July 1941, but due to wartime secrecy restrictions it was not made public until 1946. ICI (<b>Terylene)</b> and DuPont (Dacron) went on to produce their own versions of the fibre.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system used}} two, later three, hydrogen-filled {{balloons}} positioned above each other along a common tether {{to support a}} 9 metre ft, resin-bonded, <b>terylene</b> spherical radome inflated by a built-in fan to a pressure of 980 pascals (10 cm H2O). Each balloon generated [...] of lift, and the [...] radome was carried to an altitude of [...] Electrical power and control signals were provided to the gyroscopically stabilised radar system mounted inside the radome via the tether cable, and the radar-plot-video signal generated by it was transmitted to the ground using a microwave radio link.|$|E

50|$|In her 1930s heyday, she {{represented}} {{the most advanced}} technical design for spars, rigging, sails, deck gear and ropes. Her masts were aluminium, made by bending plates and riveting them together. Sails were made from the new <b>Terylene</b> threads and deck gear now included winches for easier handling of sheets. The standing rigging was solid rod, even in the 1930s, but with so much stretch in the rigging and systems {{it was inevitable that}} J Class masts could not be held in column and would collapse in stronger winds. In anything above a force 3, there was serious concern about holding the rig in place without collapse.|$|E
50|$|After the war Smith {{returned}} to ICI as Technical Director {{and was replaced}} as Chief Engineer of Armament Design by Sir Steuart Mitchell who promoted Beeching, then 33 years old, to the post of Deputy Chief Engineer with a rank equivalent to that of Brigadier. Beeching continued his work with armaments, particularly anti-aircraft weaponry and small arms. In 1948 he joined ICI, as Personal Technical Assistant to Sir Frank Smith; he remained for around 18 months, working on the production lines for various products such as zip fasteners, paints and leathercloth {{with a view to}} improving efficiency and reducing production costs. He was then appointed to the <b>Terylene</b> Council, and subsequently to the board of ICI Fibres Division.|$|E
50|$|Polyethylene terephthalate, {{the most}} common type of polyester, is {{the most common}} fiber used in sailcloth; it is also {{commonly}} referred to by the brand name Dacron. PET has excellent resiliency, high abrasion resistance, high UV resistance, high flex strength and low cost. Low absorbency allows the fiber to dry quickly. PET has been replaced by stronger fibers for most serious racing applications, but remains the most popular sail cloth due to lower price and high durability. Dacron is the brand name of Dupont’s Type 52 high modulus fiber made specifically for sailcloth. Allied Signal has produced a fiber called 1W70 polyester that has a 27% higher tenacity than Dacron. Other trade names include <b>Terylene,</b> Tetoron, Trevira and Diolen.|$|E
5000|$|Clothes {{transformed}} from boxy styles, with square shoulders, to feminine and luxurious, with soft shoulder lines, corseted waists, round padded hips, and long skirts, {{leading to the}} knee-length [...] "sack" [...] dress. The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including <b>Terylene,</b> Orlon, Banlon, Acrilan and Poplin, allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line. Essentially, the petticoat reinforced the femininity of this period.|$|E
5000|$|Two C Class {{were chosen}} to go to Thorpe Bay YC for the match and the Australian team of six were -John Munns, skipper, Graeme Anderson crew, Manager Max Press, John Tayor and Peter Scarfe Reserve crew and Albert Smith as Observer. The two cats were Quest (Cunningham design) and Matilda (Jourbert and Hooks design) After trials on Thorpe Bay Munns chose Quest as challenger.Both these cats were of radical in construction- Quest was honeycombe {{cardboard}} shells with light <b>terylene</b> cloth drawn over and spray painted with reinforced hulls with frames. Matilda was moulded balsa wood panels! Thus the C Class was leading the way in construction and later came the huge advances in rigs, wing masts and speed! ...|$|E
