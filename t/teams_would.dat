5|$|Both <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> {{meet again}} in the 2013 World Series, with the Red Sox winning the {{championship}} in six games. It {{was the first time}} Boston clinched the World Series at its home field, Fenway Park, since 1918.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their success}} in the rivalry series, the Red Sox still {{finished}} second to the Yankees in the AL East for the seventh straight season. Both <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> advance to the ALCS {{for the second straight}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} of the ARL and Super League was to unify and become one competition, {{to be known as}} the National Rugby League (NRL), was that only twenty <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> compete in the competition in 1998. This meant that three of the twenty-two teams from both competitions was to be demised with the addition of a new Melbourne based team. With the other Newcastle-based team, the Newcastle Knights winning the 1997 premiership, they were admitted into the new competition, however the NRL saw that two Newcastle based <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> not be financially viable.|$|E
50|$|In 2000 the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{have their}} first {{successful}} {{run at the}} Alberta Scott Tournament of Hearts, where they would {{make it all the}} way to the final before losing to Heather Godberson.

Bobby Allison's <b>team</b> <b>would</b> also furnish {{a car for}} his brother, Donnie Allison. Taking his place on the Howard racing <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be Cale Yarborough, {{returning}} from the USAC Stock Car division.|$|R
50|$|In Gaspard's {{third season}} his <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{struggle}} early {{and would not}} get better in Southeastern Conference play. His young <b>team</b> <b>would</b> finish 21-34 (9-21 SEC) and miss the 2012 NCAA Baseball Tournament.|$|R
5|$|After {{a two-week}} tryout, the Yankees signed Nova as an {{international}} free agent on July 15, 2004. Nova received an $80,000 signing bonus, about the average bonus given to a Dominican prospect. Though other <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> have offered Nova more money, he insisted on signing with the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Although initial reports {{suggested}} that between eight and ten <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> contest the first season, including {{the possibility of}} a team based in New Zealand, six teams representing Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney were announced in November2009 as the foundation clubs.|$|E
5|$|The Bills {{posted a}} 7–6–1 record again in 1963, {{but this time}} it was enough to tie with the Patriots for {{the best record in the}} eastern {{division}}. This set up the AFL's first-ever playoff game to decide which of the <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> win the division and compete in the championship. The Bills lost the game, 26–8.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 In episode 5, the {{remaining}} Men and Women faced off for immunity. The winning <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be exempt {{for the next}} episode whereas the other <b>team</b> <b>would</b> face elimination the following episode.|$|R
50|$|When {{the show}} moved to RTL 4 in 1993, a bonus game was added, which was {{played at the}} {{beginning}} of the program.In it, every contestant had to answer a question.When one got the number one answer, his or her <b>team</b> <b>would</b> get ƒ1000.If they got the number two answer, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> get ƒ500, and if they got the number 3 answer, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> get ƒ250.|$|R
50|$|This {{marked the}} first time since 1919 that a Big Ten {{basketball}} <b>team</b> <b>would</b> finish the season undefeated. This also marked the second time a Big Ten <b>team</b> <b>would</b> finish with 30 or more wins.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in the valleys, many rugby <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|His job was {{to prepare}} staff studies on {{upcoming}} potential operations. While he did do naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these had she been underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> have kept the ship afloat.|$|E
5000|$|... 1934, December: Stroh's bowling <b>team</b> <b>would</b> win American Bowling Congress, Inter{{national}}, and world's match game titles. The <b>Team</b> <b>would</b> also {{be noted}} national match champions in 1935. They would be invited and appear at the banquet.|$|R
50|$|To {{keep the}} draw regionalised <b>Team</b> 1 <b>would</b> play <b>Team</b> 18, <b>Team</b> 2 <b>would</b> play <b>Team</b> 17 and this pattern was {{repeated}} throughout the draw. The higher numbered <b>team</b> <b>would</b> play {{at home in}} the first leg.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Jeanna Schraeder {{would return}} to the <b>team,</b> and they <b>would</b> win the 2006 British Columbia Scott Tournament of Hearts. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> again find success at the 2006 Scott Tournament of Hearts, where they {{finished}} round robin in first place with a 9-2 record. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> defeat Nova Scotia's Colleen Jones in the 1-2 and would get a bye to the final. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> meet the defending champions, Jennifer Jones, in the final where they would win 8-5 and the national championship. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> just make the playoffs at the 2006 Ford World Women's Curling Championship. They would defeat Germany's Andrea Schöpp in the 3-4 game, before losing the semi-final to the U.S and Debbie McCormick.|$|R
5|$|The date of {{the draft}} was set for June 2–4, and would occur as a conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York. Unlike the 1987 NFL Draft, which aired on ESPN, no network {{televised}} the MLB draft. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible to be drafted. For the first time, junior college players would also {{be included in the}} June draft; in years past, <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> select junior college players in a separate draft.|$|E
5|$|To date, the Cardinals' 11 {{world championships}} {{are the most}} won by any National League team, and rank {{second only to the}} Yankees' 27. The Cardinals' and Yankees' last wins were within two years of each other (having {{occurred}} in 2011 and 2009, respectively). The two <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> meet again in 1928 (which the Yankees swept in four games); 1942 (which the Cardinals won in five games); 1943 (which the Yankees won in five games); and 1964 (which the Cardinals won in seven games).|$|E
5|$|Under the Alliance system, the two highest-ranked {{members of}} Alliance {{conferences}} were matched up {{in a national}} championship game. The lower-ranked conference champions and two-at large <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play each other in other bowl games. In 1995, one of these at-large spots was reserved for the champion of the Southwest Conference, which {{had been a member}} of the Bowl Coalition but was scheduled to dissolve after the 1995 season. Its members joined different conferences in an attempt to increase their revenue.|$|E
5000|$|This {{week there}} were no nominations. The 14 Housemates were split into 2 teams and competed in a competition. The winning <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be given {{immunity}} and the losing <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be up for eviction. Team one lost the competition.|$|R
50|$|For {{a second}} year in a row the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> qualify for and win the 2011 British Columbia Scotties Tournament of Hearts.

They would enter a tiebreaker with Nova Scotia's Heather Smith-Dacey. In spite of stealing two points in the tenth end, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> fall short losing the tiebreaker 8-9.|$|R
5000|$|No special draft {{would be}} held for a [...] "near-disaster"; the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> instead get {{preferential}} rights on any waivers {{until the end of}} the season. If a quarterback is among the fewer than 15 lost, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be able to draft up to two quarterbacks from all NFL teams with three available. Each <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be able to protect two, and the drafted quarterbacks would return to their original teams in the following season.|$|R
5|$|With {{the green}} light from the owners, Smith began the task of {{expanding}} the league across the border, beginning with a June 1992 exhibition game between the Argos and Stampeders in Portland, Oregon. A total of 15,362 attended, close to the averages later American <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> post. Portland was seriously considered for a franchise, but investors failed to emerge. The expansion announcement prompted numerous applications {{from a wide variety}} of American cities. By the end of the expansion era, a minimum of 22 cities are reported to have been considered for teams.|$|E
5|$|England {{had four}} captains in Gatting, John Emburey, Chris Cowdrey and Graham Gooch, but each Test ended in West Indian dominance. They won each match except the first Test, which was drawn because of rain, and the series {{finished}} 4–0. The West Indies pace attack {{was the main}} difference between teams with Marshall being the most dangerous bowler, taking 35 wickets at an average of 12.65. This included a 7/22 in the third Test which he bowled with a broken left hand. Marshall was supported by Ambrose's bowling which yielded 22 wickets. After this series both <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> go into decline. Many of the great West Indian players such as Richards and Marshall would soon retire, and their dominance of the Test stage was nearing its end.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E
50|$|The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> again {{participate}} in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, and with many expecting them to take the championship, disappointed many along with themselves. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> only win 2 games, tied for second last place, with a 2-5 record.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{contestant}} made a mistake, such {{as walking}} into a virtual flame, they would [...] "die". Then {{another member of the}} <b>team</b> <b>would</b> enter the labyrinth, wearing the helmet. If three members of the team [...] "died", the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> lose.|$|R
5000|$|She {{would return}} to the junior championships again in 1993, this time playing third stones for Tara Hamer. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> finish in tenth place with a 2-9 record. [...] The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> return again in 1994, {{finishing}} with a 5-6 record.|$|R
5|$|Group Two, {{under the}} command of Captain Burn, would land at the old {{entrance}} to the St Nazaire basin. Their objectives were to destroy the anti-aircraft positions in the area and the German headquarters, to blow up the locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter-attack from the submarine base. Group Three was {{under the command}} of Major William 'Bill' Copland, who was also the Commandos' second in command. They were to secure the immediate area around Campbeltown, destroy the dock's water-pumping and gate-opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks. All three groups were subdivided into assault, demolition and protection teams. The assault <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> clear the way for the other two. The demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self-defence; the protection teams, armed with Thompson submachine guns, were to defend them while they completed their tasks.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the World Junior Hockey Championship was a {{round robin}} tournament. The teams {{with the top}} three records won the gold, silver and bronze medals. Finland had {{finished}} their schedule with a 5–1–1 record to lead the tournament. Canada entered {{the game with a}} 4–1–1 record, and had already been assured the bronze medal. A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by more than four goals would have won the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering the game with a 2–3–1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled to be the final game of the tournament as organizers expected {{at least one of the}} <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> be playing for the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Sugar Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of the Bowl Alliance. The Alliance, {{predecessor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match the champions of the Southeastern Conference, Big East Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, Southwest Conference, and one at-large team against each other in the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. Each year, the two highest-ranked <b>teams</b> <b>would</b> play in a National Championship Game held in place of one of the bowl games. The site of the national championship game rotated among the three bowl games, as did the date of each game. Following the 1995 college football season, the Sugar Bowl was designated for December 31, marking the first time two Sugar Bowls would be held in the same calendar year.|$|E
50|$|For {{a second}} year in a row the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> qualify for and win the 2011 British Columbia Scotties Tournament of Hearts. This time Carter would attend the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts six months pregnant. After round robin play concluded, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> be tied for fourth place with a 7-4 record. They would enter a tiebreaker with Nova Scotia's Heather Smith-Dacey. In spite of {{stealing}} two points in the tenth end, the <b>team</b> <b>would</b> fall short losing the tiebreaker 8-9.|$|R
50|$|The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> {{return in}} 2005 with more success. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> take second place at Monza before {{finishing}} out {{the season with}} points finishes in all remaining races, once again earning them sixth in the championship. The <b>team</b> <b>would</b> also make their debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with an alliance with Zytek Engineering. The car ran in 12th place towards the finish, but mechanical problems prevented the car from crossing the finishing line and thus leaving the car unclassified.|$|R
50|$|In Gaspard's {{second season}} at Alabama his <b>team</b> <b>would</b> go 35-28 (14-16 SEC). His <b>team</b> <b>would</b> go 1-2 in the 2011 SEC Baseball Tournament {{then they would}} make the 2011 NCAA Baseball Tournament losing to Florida State 11-1 in the Tallahassee Regional Championship Game.|$|R
