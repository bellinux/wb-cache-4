40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Performance improvement investigations to the Naval Postgraduate School Turbo Propulsion Laboratorys (NPS TPL) Transonic Axially Splittered Rotor were investigated. Implementation of current NPS TPL design procedure that uses COTS software (MATLAB, SolidWorks, and ANSYS-CFX) for the geometric rendering and analysis was modified and documented. Numerical simulations were conducted and experimental {{data were collected}} at the NPS TPL utilizing the transonic compressor rig. This study advanced the understanding of casing tip gap, rotor-stator interaction, stator relative blade placement of a hybrid tandem/splittered design, and performance benefits. The reduction in rotor tip gap produced higher performance bench marks as predicted. The addition and analysis of multiple blade rows proved to be straight forward and the design methodology and in house procedure was further optimized.

40|$|Achievement of {{an optimal}} {{compressor}} design {{with respect to}} its aerodynamic performance and feasible structural mechanics within an automated optimization process is subject of this paper. The compressor considered is a highly loaded, transonic fan stage, designed for achievement of a very high pressure ratio. To ensure operation in highly integrated installation conditions, a sufficient stability margin is of major concern. Multiple aerodynamic operating points at two rotational speeds allowed optimization of both the stability margin and the working line stage efficiency. On the part of structural mechanics, several static stress criteria were addressed for definite blade regions {{as well as the}} dynamic blade behavior in terms of the Campbell diagram. An optimization strategy was chosen, which targeted firstly on the fulfillment of multiple mechanical and aerodynamical constraints, while the aerodynamic performance was under constraint itself. Upon achievement, optimization aimed for maximum aerodynamic performance while keeping mechanics feasible. Response surfaces have been incorporated in the optimization process to reconcile costly high fidelity CFD and structural simulations with the large number of 114 free design parameters. Furthermore, optimization on these models enabled a successfully accomplishment of the constraint issue by a large number of numerically cheaper fitness evaluations. Starting from an already optimized baseline configuration, the current work targeted an improvement of the rotor aerodynamics in the transonic hub region and the resolution of previously unsolved problems concerning the rotor structural mechanics. Free design parameters were hub and casing contours in the rotor part, the shape of the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>blade</b> edges and a high degree of freedom for rotor profile sections in {{the lower half of the}} blade...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the von Karman vortices formation at the <b>blade</b> <b>trailing</b> edge of a large scale turbine cascade. The mean and time varying characteristics of the flow in the trailing edge region were measured by means of a two-component fiber-optic laser Doppler velocimeter over an experimental grid very close to the <b>blade</b> <b>trailing</b> edge. A phase locked ensemble averaging technique has been applied to separate coherent and incoherent contributions in the instantaneous LDV data. The trailing edge of the central blade of the cascade has been instrumented with a multisensor surface mounted hot-film probe. The probe outputs proportional to the instantaneous wall shear stress were sampled simultaneously with a filtered reference signal from a hot-wire probe located in the wake and sensitive to the vortex periodicity. Organised periodic structures have been clearly identified in the flow and their evolution in time has been documented through a sequence of instantaneous pictures of the periodic flow field during a cycle of the vortex shedding. Time-averaged and time-resolved ensemble averaged wall shear stresses on the <b>blade</b> <b>trailing</b> edge help to identify the positions where the boundary layers separate and to analyze the effects of the vortex shedding on the wall shear stress along the trailing edge...|$|R

However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the switch blades into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the catch points are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the catch points and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances.|$|R

Sharpening the <b>blade</b> <b>trailing</b> edges near the tip was effective in reducing broad band noise near 2 kHz. For multiple machines the sound fields are superposed. A three-fold increase in number of machines (from 1 to 3) results in a predicted increase in he sound pressure level of about 5 dB.

The experiments were conducted for different flow coefficients and differeent radial gaps between the impeller <b>blade</b> <b>trailing</b> edge and the diffuser vane leading edge (5 and 8 percent of the impeller discharge radius).

However, the dependence of the fluctuations on the flow coefficient was found to be different for te diffuser vanes and the impeller blades; on the vane suction side, the fluctuations were largest for the maximum flow coefficient and decreased with decreasing flow coefficient, whereas at the <b>blade</b> <b>trailing</b> edge, the fluctuations were smallest for the maximum flow coefficient and increased with decreasing flow coefficient.

40|$|A vehicle concept {{study has}} been made to meet the {{requirements}} of the Large Civil Tilt Rotorcraft vehicle mission. A vehicle concept was determined, and a notional turboshaft engine system study was conducted. The engine study defined requirements for the major engine components, including the compressor. The compressor design-point goal was to deliver a pressure ratio of 31 : 1 at an inlet weight flow of 28. 4 lbm/sec. To perform a conceptual design of two potential compressor configurations to meet the design requirement, a mean-line compressor flow analysis and design code were used. The first configuration is an eight-stage axial compressor. Some challenges of the all-axial compressor are the small blade spans of the rear-block stages being 0. 28 in., resulting in the last-stage blade tip clearance-to-span ratio of 2. 4 %. The second configuration is a seven-stage axial compressor, with a centrifugal stage having a 0. 28 -in. impeller-exit blade span.
