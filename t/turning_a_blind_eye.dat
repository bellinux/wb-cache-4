500|$|Although the PRIA {{limited the}} number of horses that could be adopted in any one year by a single adopter to four, it allowed the BLM to make {{exceptions}} to the limit. [...] In the mid-1980s, the BLM had placed for adoption over 20,000 horses to large scale adopters, and thousands of the horses were slaughtered. [...] In March 1987, the Animal Protection Institute sued the Department of the Interior, arguing that BLM was <b>turning</b> <b>a</b> <b>blind</b> <b>eye</b> to [...] "adopters" [...] who obtained horses {{with the intent to}} slaughter. In Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 671 F. Supp. 695 (1987), the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held that BLM could not ignore the intent of adopters. The decision was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Animal Protection Institute v. Hodel, 860 F.2d 920 (1988). In 1988, the BLM terminated the large scale adoption program. [...] In 1997, the Animal Protection Institute and BLM signed an out-of-court settlement under which BLM would require individuals to sign an affidavit stating they had no intent to sell the animal for slaughter or for use as rodeo stock. The settlement also required BLM to establish rules requiring horse slaughterhouses to maintain paperwork on horses for no less than one year and to report any horses to which clear title was not established. BLM also agreed to no longer permit adoption by proxy or power of attorney. But the district court refused to enforce this settlement in 2000, leaving the issue unresolved.|$|E
