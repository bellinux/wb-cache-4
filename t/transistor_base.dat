Finally it is occasionally made microadjustable by adding a low value pot in series with the Zener; this allows a little voltage adjustment, but degrades regulation (see also capacitance multiplier).|$|E

5000|$|There {{are other}} clamp circuits. A 1959 manual {{describes}} {{a technique called}} [...] "saturation clamping". [...] In that scheme, there is a saturation clamp supply at about 2 volts connected to the collector with a saturation clamp diode. When the transistor nears saturation, the clamp diode turns on and supplies the extra collector current to keep the transistor from saturating. The saturation clamp supply needs to supply substantial current. In contrast, the Baker clamp reduces the <b>transistor</b> <b>base</b> current rather than supplying more collector current.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{transistor}} in the circuit {{is to reduce the}} portion of the current in RR supplied by the op-amp. Without the transistor, the current through RC would be iOUT = (VCC − vIN)/RC, which interferes with the design goal of independence of iOUT from VCC. Another practical advantage of the transistor is that the op amp must deliver only the small <b>transistor</b> <b>base</b> current, which is unlikely to tax the op amp's current delivery capability. Of course, only real op amps are current-limited, not nullors.|$|E

5000|$|Using {{properties}} of the input nullator portion of the nullor, the input voltage across the op amp input terminals is zero. Consequently, the voltage across reference resistor RR is the applied voltage vIN, making the current in RR simply vIN/RR. Again using the nullator properties, the input current to the nullor is zero. Consequently, Kirchhoff's current law at the emitter provides an emitter current of vIN/RR. Using {{properties of}} the norator output portion of the nullor, the nullor provides whatever current is demanded of it, regardless of the voltage at its output. In this case, it provides the <b>transistor</b> <b>base</b> current iB. Thus, Kirchhoff's current law applied to the transistor as a whole provides the output current drawn through resistor RC as ...|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{is illustrated in}} Figure 3. The gate current makes an equivalent NPN transistor switch on, which in turn draws current {{from the base of}} an equivalent PNP transistor, turning it on also. Part of the gate current (dotted line) is lost through the ohmic path across the p-silicon, flowing directly into MT1 without passing through the NPN <b>transistor</b> <b>base.</b> In this case, the injection of holes in the p-silicon makes the stacked n, p and n layers beneath MT1 behave like a NPN transistor, which turns on due to the presence of a current in its base. This, in turn, causes the p, n and p layers over MT2 to behave like a PNP transistor, which turns on because its n-type base becomes forward-biased with respect to its emitter (MT2). Thus, the triggering scheme is the same as an SCR. The equivalent circuit is depicted in Figure 4.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{transistors}} {{instead of}} vacuum tubes as the amplifier elements {{meant that the}} device was much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio, and was more shock-resistant.
