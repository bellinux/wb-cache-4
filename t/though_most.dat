Although most critics consider Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings more favorably, The Heart of a Woman has received positive reviews. It was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in 1997.|$|E

Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.|$|E

Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, <b>though</b> <b>most</b> of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately disallowed or struck down as unconstitutional.|$|E
