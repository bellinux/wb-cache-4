In support of Westinghouse Hanford Company`s (WHC) efforts to ensure continued safe storage of these organic- and oxidant-bearing wastes and to define the conditions necessary for reactions to occur, we measured the thermal sensitivities and thermochemical and thermokinetic properties of mixtures of selected organics and sodium nitrate and/or nitrite and a simulated Hanford organic-bearing waste using <b>thermoanalytical</b> technologies.

Also, having effect on the <b>thermoanalytical</b> properties of starch, of modification process pregelatinization, cross-linking and dextrinization increased the temperatures of gelatinization initiation, peak, and final points. In addition, the modification process decreased the change in the value of entalphi. In general, peaks appeared in shorter time in corn starch amylograph than that in wheat starch for all the modified methods. The wheat starch had more swelling capacity than those of the corn starch at 30 and 40 oC.

The reaction in aqueous solution of H(2) BCA with cupric ions in the presence of some reducing agents [ascorbic acid, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydrazine sulphate] was studied varying time, temperature, pH, metal/ligand and metal/reducing agent mole ratio. At pH {{greater than or equal to}} 7, with an excess of reducing agent compared to the metal ion concentration, if C-L/C-M > 5, copper(II) is wholly reduced to copper(I) which forms [CuL(2) ](3 -) chelate complex.

The reducing agent concentration can be determined, indirectly, if an excess of copper(II), compared to the reducing agent, is used and if the stoichiometry of the redox reaction is known.

40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of {{decomposition}} products of electrolytes on the thermal stability of bare and TiO 2 -coated Li 1 -xNi 0. 8 Co 0. 2 O 2 (1 > x >= 0) cathode material have been investigated by means of <b>thermoanalytical,</b> thermokinetic and temperature-programmed desorption-mass spectroscopy (TPD-MS) techniques. It is shown clearly that the decomposition products of the electrolytes such as carboxylates have distinctive effects on the thermal stability of the electrode materials. Firstly, the <b>thermoanalytical</b> and TPD-MS results indicate that surface coating can suppress the amount of oxygen release from the delithiated cathode material. The thermokinetic analytical {{results show that the}} reaction of oxygen release (i. e. oxygen loss) from delithiated Li 1 -xNi 0. 8 Co 0. 2 O 2 material can be promoted by carboxylate salts supported on the electrode surface due to the decrease of initiated activation energy E-a of the reaction. Finally, the amount of carboxylate salts and length of carbon chains in carboxylates have different promotional effects on the thermal properties of the electrode materials.
