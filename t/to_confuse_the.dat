5|$|Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to tie down German forces away from Normandy by threatening other targets. Ironside's specific {{objective was to}} tie up the 17th SS and 11th Panzer divisions deployed {{in the south of}} France.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. Royal Flush developed {{a series of}} political misdirections in mid-1944 to support other deceptions between June and July. It evolved from Operation Graffham, a political deception aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through Operation Fortitude South.|$|E
5|$|In {{the lead}} up to the assault on Musa Qaleh, members of the Brigade Reconnaissance Force {{provided}} vital intelligence for the upcoming operation. Coalition military manoeuvres and a build-up of troops and supplies continued for weeks before the assault. On 1 November, British forces started reconnaissance patrols {{in preparation for the}} attack. In the middle of that month, the MOD reported that troops from Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF), 40 Commando Royal Marines and the Right Flank Company of the Scots Guards were patrolling outside the town <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Taliban insurgents and disrupt their supply routes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at Cap Nègre to {{the west}} of the main invasion, a large group of French commandos {{destroyed}} German artillery emplacements as part of Operation Romeo. Their main effort was supported by diversionary flank landings by other commando teams. While the main mission succeeded, 67 French commandos were taken prisoner after they ran into a minefield. In addition to the commando operations, another operation was carried out, named Operation Span. This was a deception plan, aimed <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> German defenders with fake landings and paratroopers, to disperse them from the actual landing zones.|$|E

5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One {{of the key}} elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (although they had earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{operation}} was due to begin on January 1, but poor ice conditions on the Neva caused the offensive to be delayed until January 10–12. A number of measures were taken to prevent the details of {{the operation}} being revealed to the Germans. Only a limited number of senior officers were involved in the planning, all redeployments took place in bad weather or at night and simulated attack preparations were made elsewhere <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> German side.|$|E
5|$|The Phengaris rebeli is a brood parasite, an {{organism}} that manipulates another organism (the host) {{to raise its}} offspring; in this case, the P. rebeli parasitizes a particular species of ant, the Myrmica schencki. The P. rebeli was first discovered to be a brood parasite when a researcher observed M. schencki ants bringing the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nest. One of the proposed hypotheses for this parasitism was that P. rebeli larvae released chemicals <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> ants into believing they were ant larvae.|$|E

5|$|Fatally, the Aulic Council {{decided to}} make Northern Italy the main theater of {{operations}} for the Habsburgs. Archduke Charles was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the Adige River with Mantua, Peschiera, and Milan as the initial objectives. The Austrians based an army of 72,000 men on Ulm. Nominally commanded by Archduke Ferdinand, the army's real authority was Mack. Austrian strategy required that Archduke John with 23,000 troops secure the Tyrol and provide the link between his brother Charles's army and his cousin Ferdinand's army. The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in Pomerania and the British in Naples, though these were designed <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> French and divert their resources.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the 1944 invasion of Normandy, the Allied nations conducted a complex series of deceptions under the codename Bodyguard. The overall aim of the plan was <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> German high command as to the exact location and timing of the invasion. Significant time was spent constructing the First United States Army Group, a notional army to threaten Pas de Calais, along with political and visual deceptions to communicate a fictional Allied battle plan. Copperhead was {{a small portion of}} Bodyguard conceived by Dudley Clarke. Earlier in the war Clarke had pioneered the idea of strategic deception, forming a deception department in Cairo named 'A' Force. Clarke and 'A' Force were not officially in charge of Bodyguard planning (a role that fell to the London Controlling Section), but because of the location of the deception the Cairo planners organised much of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Axis {{high command}} as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies {{committed to a}} landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E

5|$|Operations Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{tactical}} military deceptions {{conducted on}} 6 June 1944 {{in support of}} the Allied landings in Normandy. The operations formed the naval component of Operation Bodyguard, a wider series of tactical and strategic deceptions surrounding the invasion. Small boats, along with aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, simulated invasion fleets approaching Cap d'Antifer, Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Glimmer and Taxable played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main invasion force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real invasion force to try to confuse German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented Operation Titanic, which was intended <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic ant species {{enter the}} colonies of host ants and {{establish}} themselves as social parasites; {{species such as}} Strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic {{and do not have}} workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts. This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.|$|E
5|$|Revie felt he did {{not have}} to {{strengthen}} his squad for the 1965–66 campaign, and made no new signings. With Leeds in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup he showed his gamesmanship, sending his team out against Italian club Torino wearing unfamiliar numbers in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Italian club's tight man-marking system. However Collins had his leg broken by Torino's Fabrizio Poletti, meaning Revie had to partner Giles and Bremner in central midfield and sign Huddersfield Town winger Michael O'Grady for £30,000. Although Collins would be missed the partnership of Giles and Bremner would prove highly effective. Leeds again finished second in the league, trailing Liverpool by six points. They reached the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing on aggregate to Spanish side Real Zaragoza despite Revie ordering the fire brigade to flood the pitch before the replay at Elland Road.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using chaff <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had been carrying mustard gas, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.|$|E
5|$|The {{merchant}} ship SS Mamari III was converted to resemble Hermes as a decoy ship <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Axis where Hermes was actually operating. The superstructure was mainly a wooden mock-up. She {{was a part}} of the phantom fleet of mock-up British warships designated as Fleet Tender C. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back to a {{merchant ship}}, the decoy Hermes hit a submerged wreck and ran aground off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before being refloated she was totally disabled by German E-boats commanded by Niels Bätge. The Germans initially thought they had sunk an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for a {{battalion}} of army infantry to land by destroyer on Guadalcanal around 14 January {{to act as a}} rear guard during the evacuation. The 17th Army was to begin withdrawing to the western end of the island about 25 or 26 January. An air superiority campaign around the southern Solomons would begin on 28 January. The 17th Army would be picked up in three lifts by destroyers the first week of February with a target completion date of 10 February. At the same time, Japanese air and naval forces would conduct conspicuous maneuvers and minor attacks around New Guinea and the Marshall Islands along with deceptive radio traffic to try <b>to</b> <b>confuse</b> <b>the</b> Allies as to their intentions.|$|E
