25|$|A single <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> is {{composed}} of four different types of cells, and each <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the <b>taste</b> <b>bud.</b> Every cell in the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> forms microvilli at the ends.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} taste {{is based on the}} {{detection}} of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have taste buds, which are replaced every ten days. Each <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> contains receptor cells. Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells {{at the base of the}} <b>taste</b> <b>bud.</b> A single <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds. Fungiform papillae are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The salivary glands are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.|$|E

40|$|<b>Taste</b> <b>buds</b> are the {{peripheral}} sensory organs of the gustatory system. They occur in all taxa of vertebrates and are pear-shaped intra-epithelial organs of about 80 microm height and 50 microm width. <b>Taste</b> <b>buds</b> mainly consist of specialized epithelial cells, which synapse at their bases and therefore are secondary sensory cells. <b>Taste</b> <b>buds</b> {{have been described}} based on studies of teleostean species, {{but it turned out}} that the ultrastructure of teleostean <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> may differ between distinct systematic groups and that this description is not representative of those <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> in other main taxa of fishes, such as selachians, holosteans and dipnoans. Furthermore, it is not known how variable the micromorphologies of non-teleostean <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> are. For this reason the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> of two holosteans, Lepisosteus oculatus and Amia calva, were investigated and compared. While in both species the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> are of the same shapes and sizes, the cellular components of their sensory epithelia differ: in Lepisosteus <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> comprise two types of elongated light cells and one type of dark cells. In contrast, Amia <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> contain only one type of light, but two types of dark elongated cells. Afferent synapses are common in the buds of both species, efferent synapses occur only in Lepisosteus <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> These differences show that even in the small group of holostean fishes the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> are differently organized. Consequently, a representative type of fish <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> does not exist...|$|R

40|$|Sections {{of tissues}} {{containing}} lingual and extra-lingual <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> were evaluated with monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratins. In the caudal {{third of the}} rat's tongue, keratin 20 immunoreactivity was restricted to <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> whereas keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19 were expressed in vallate and foliate <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> and in cells of salivary ducts that merge with these taste epithelia. Hence, antibodies against keratin 20 most clearly distinguished differentiated taste cells from all other cells. In rat epiglottis, <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> and isolated bipolar cells were keratin- 20 -positive. In rat nasopalatine papilla and palate, antibodies against keratin 20 identified Merkel cells, none of which was near to the keratin- 20 -negative <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> Nor were Merkel cells present at epiglottal <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> or the keratin- 20 -negative fungiform <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> or elsewhere in rat tongue. Hence, Merkel cells make no contribution to rat fungiform, epiglottal, nasopalatine, or palatal <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> Human and rat keratin- 20 -positive tissues are reported to be endodermal derivatives {{with the exception of}} Merkel cells and luminal urothelial cells. In rats the distribution of keratin- 20 -positive <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> was in full agreement with the classical view that the posterior third of the tongue is derived from endoderm (keratin- 20 -positive <b>taste</b> <b>buds),</b> whereas the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is derived from stomadeal ectoderm (keratin- 20 -negative <b>taste</b> <b>buds).</b> The equally intense keratin 20 immunoreactivity of human fungiform and vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> violates this traditional rostro-caudal segregation and suggests that endodermally derived tissues may be present in the tip of the human tongue...|$|R

Umami receptor cells are the least understood and accordingly are the type most intensively under research.|$|E
25|$|CD36's {{association}} {{with the ability to}} taste fats has made it a target for various studies regarding obesity and alteration of lipid tasting. CD36 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> cells (TBC) of obese sand rats (P. obesus) compared to lean controls, implicating an association between CD36 and obesity. Although actual levels of CD36 protein were not different between the obese and control rat cells, Abdoul-Azize et al. hypothesize that the physical distribution of CD36 could differ in obese rat cells. Changes in calcium mediation have been associated with CD36 and obesity as well. <b>Taste</b> <b>bud</b> cells (more specifically, cells from the circumvallate papillae) containing CD36 that were isolated from obese mice exhibited a significantly smaller increase in calcium after fatty acid stimulation when compared to control mice: CD36 associated calcium regulation is impaired when mice are made to be obese (but not in normal weight mice), and this could be a mechanism contributing to behavior changes in the obese mice, such as decreased lipid taste sensitivity and decreased attraction to fats.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E

25|$|Sweetness is {{produced}} {{by the presence of}} sugars, some proteins, and a few other substances. It is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors coupled to a G protein that acts as an intermediary in the communication between <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> and brain, gustducin. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.|$|E
25|$|Distortions in {{the taste}} buds may {{give rise to}} dysgeusia. In a study {{conducted}} by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the nucleus and cytoplasm of the <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of microvilli and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tongue is}} covered with {{thousands}} of small bumps called papillae, which are {{visible to the naked}} eye. [...] Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds. The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the development of}} upper airway chemoreceptors, epiglottal <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> were counted in cat fetuses, kittens and adults. <b>Taste</b> <b>buds</b> with structural characteristics {{similar to those in}} the adult were observed in all fetuses close to term and in kittens from birth. During the first postnatal week a mean of 76 <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> was present on the kitten epiglottis and by adulthood 800 were observed. The number of <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> increased as a logarithmic function of both age and weight, but the correlation with weight is better than that with age. The presence of epiglottal <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> from very early developmental stages suggests that these receptors may mediate the reflex apnoea and swallowing that occur in response to chemical stimulation of the larynx in newborns...|$|R
40|$|ATP and its {{metabolites}} {{are important}} for taste signaling in <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> and thus a clearance system for them would play critical roles in maintenance of gustatory function. A previous report revealed that mRNAs for ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase (NT 5 E) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) were expressed by taste cells of <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> and NT 5 E-immunoreactivity was detected in taste cells. However, there was no information on PAP-immunoreactivity in <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> In this study, we examined the expression profile of PAP in rat <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> In the isolated rat <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> we detected expression of mRNA for PAP, but NT 5 E was not detected differing from the case of mouse ones (Dando et al., 2012, J Neuroscience). On immunohistochemical analysis, PAP-immunoreactivity was found predominantly in NTPDase 2 -positive type I and SNAP 25 -positive type III taste cells, while there were no apparent signals of it in PLC-β 2 -positive type II, α-gustducin-positive type II, AADC-positive type III and 5 HT-positive type III ones. As for NT 5 E, we could not detect its immunoreactivity in rat <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> and co-localization of it with any taste cell markers, although mouse <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> expressed NT 5 E as reported previously. These findings suggest that PAP expressed by type I and one of type III taste cells of rats may contribute to metabolic regulation of the extracellular levels of adenine nucleotides in the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> of circumvallate papillae, and the regulating mechanisms for adenine nucleotides in <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> might be different between rats and mice...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{primary cause}} of dysgeusia is zinc deficiency. While the exact role of zinc in dysgeusia is unknown, it has been cited that zinc is partly {{responsible}} for the repair and production of taste buds. Zinc somehow directly or indirectly interacts with carbonic anhydrase VI, influencing the concentration of gustin, which is linked to the production of taste buds. It has also been reported that patients treated with zinc experience an elevation in calcium concentration in the saliva. In order to work properly, taste buds rely on calcium receptors. Zinc “is an important cofactor for alkaline phosphatase, the most abundant enzyme in <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> membranes; it is also a component of a parotid salivary protein important to the development and maintenance of normal taste buds.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Taste in the {{gustatory}} {{system allows}} humans {{to distinguish between}} safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. Digestive enzymes in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds.

2500|$|Taste {{is a form}} of chemoreception {{which occurs}} in the {{specialised}} taste receptors in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of sensory transduction: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that [...] "gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant". Researchers believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make [...] "keep or spit out" [...] decisions when {{there is more than one}} tastant present. [...] "No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli." [...] As well, serotonin is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a <b>taste</b> <b>bud,</b> mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of microvilli of the taste cells.|$|E

40|$|The number, {{morphology}} and anatomical {{distribution of}} the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> in the arch of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) oro-pharyngeal cavity were analysed.

The histological observation on serial sections from the two portions allowed to clarify the oro-pharyngeal cavity structural organization. Morphometrical analyses on the <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> number and distribution were also performed. <b>Taste</b> <b>buds</b> are localised mainly in the cranial portion of palate and in the caudal portion of the pharynx; in this latter portion the palatin organ is also located. On the palatin area, <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> exceed the epithelial surface with their apical portion and therefore they may be referred to those reported as type I and II. On the contrary, pharyngeal <b>taste</b> <b>buds,</b> remain mostly confined in the epithelial level and so they may be referred to those defined as type III. <b>Taste</b> <b>buds</b> are located on elevated papillae, which are expansions of the mucosal lamina propria.

40|$|The rat vallate papilla is bilaterally {{innervated by}} the IXth nerve whose axons are {{required}} for the normal development of its several hundred <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> Temporary denervation during the developmental sensitive period for <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> prevented most vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> from forming. Specifically, removing one IXth nerve and crushing the other in 3 day old neonates eliminated axons from the vallate papilla for about 10 days and by adulthood resulted in a mean +/- 1 S. E. M. of 48 +/- 12 vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> Two explanations for the shortfall of adult vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> were evaluated: either 10 days of neonatal denervation impaired the gustatory competence of the vallate papilla, or the IXth nerve's trophic support of <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> failed to recover after nerve crush on day 3. In adults, {{it was found that}} a IXth nerve previously crushed on day 3 would support numerous vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> (183 +/- 27), provided that the vallate papilla had been continuously innervated by the contralateral IXth nerve during neonatal development. Consequently, taste neurons, whose axons had been crushed on day 3, seemed to survive and retain their trophic capacity to support <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> in adults. To test for diminished competence of the gustatory epithelium, one IXth nerve was crushed on day 3 while the contralateral IXth nerve was removed. Beginning on day 75, the chorda tympani nerve was substituted for the re-innervating axons of the crushed IXth nerve. The cross-innervating chorda tympani ultimately supported only 51 +/- 10 vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds.</b> In contrast, in vallate papillae that developed without interruption of the contralateral IXth nerve during the sensitive period, the cross-innervating chorda tympani by itself supported more than four times as many vallate <b>taste</b> <b>buds</b> (214 +/- 22). Evidently, a neonatal period of denervation permanently restricts the gustatory competence of the vallate epithelium; nerve-dependent precursors of taste receptor cells probably died or gpermanently changed their fate...|$|R
2500|$|The smelt-whitings are benthic carnivores, {{with all}} of the species whose diets have been studied showing similar prey preferences. Smelt-whitings have well {{developed}} chemosensory systems compared to many other teleost fishes, with high <b>taste</b> <b>bud</b> densities on the outside tip of the snout. The turbulence and turbidity of the environment appear to determine how well developed the sensory systems are in an individual. Studies from the waters of Thailand, Philippines and Australia have shown that polychaetes, a variety of crustaceans, molluscs {{and to a lesser extent}} echinoderms and fish are the predominant prey items of the family. Commonly taken crustaceans include decapods, copepods and isopods, while the predominant molluscs taken are various species of bivalves, especially the unprotected siphon filters that protrude from the shells. In all species studied, some form of diet shift occurs as the fishes mature, often associated with a movement to deeper waters and thus to new potential prey. The juveniles often prey on planktonic prey, with small copepods, isopods and other small crustaceans often taken. Whilst many species have a change in niche to reduce intraspecific competition, there are often many species of sillaginid inhabiting a geographical area. Where this occurs, there is often definite diet differences between species, often associated with a niche specialization. The sillaginid's distinctive body shape and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, which is the predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E
