25|$|Documents {{released}} by the British Museum under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that a series of minor accidents, thefts and acts of vandalism by visitors have inflicted further damage to the sculptures. This includes an incident in 1961 when two schoolboys knocked off {{a part of a}} centaur's leg. In June 1981, a west pediment figure was slightly chipped by a falling glass skylight, and in 1966 four shallow lines were scratched on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the figures by vandals. In 1970 letters were scratched on to the upper right thigh of another figure. Four years later, the dowel hole in a centaur's hoof was damaged by thieves trying to extract pieces of lead.|$|E
25|$|Markedly {{improved}} {{results were}} {{shown on the}} field, with South Sydney winning their first three games of the 2007 season (marking their best start to a season since 1972) and being competitive in every game. On <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the best defences in the competition, the Rabbitohs finished strongly, making the semi-finals {{for the first time}} since 1989. They finished the season in 7th position with 12 wins. Souths' season ended in the first week of the finals, losing 30-6 to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles(who they had beaten in a regular season match only a few weeks before, prompting hope among the Rabbitohs faithful that a repeat victory and a serious finals campaign was possible) at Brookvale Oval.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} the {{artillery}} continued to fire on likely Viet Cong forming-up points, although 11 Platoon's final position was avoided for fear of hitting any survivors. Meanwhile, US aircraft bombed likely withdrawal routes to the east. Forming a defensive position ready to repulse an expected attack the Australians remained overnight, enduring the cold and heavy rain. Although they were now {{in a better position}} to hold off any subsequent attack, further reinforcement from 1 ATF at night would be difficult and was therefore unlikely. Yet with the Viet Cong spent no further attack was mounted. Smith and Townsend spent the night in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the carriers planning the clearance of the battlefield and follow-up of the Viet Cong, which was scheduled for the following day under the codename Operation Smithfield. Jackson stipulated the force was to remain within artillery range, but would otherwise have freedom of action to complete the exploitation over the next two to three days. Townsend requested the remaining APCs bring out 6 RAR headquarters, C Company and a section of mortars the following morning, while D Company, 5 RAR would also be placed under his command for the operation. However, with a company from 5 RAR still in Binh Ba, the bulk of 1 ATF's remaining combat power would be deployed as part of the clearance, leaving just two infantry companies from 5 RAR to defend Nui Dat. Smith was determined to recover the missing from 11 Platoon, and despite its losses, D Company would lead the assault.|$|E

In the first season he accounted for 85 of his team's 167 points, and 15 of the points in the Grey Cup game, a 23–0 drubbing of the Edmonton Eskimos. It was the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history.|$|E

Physically he is described as 183 centimetres (6feet) in height and 76 kilograms (168lb) in weight.

Shortly after crossing the Euphrates River, the militants, who were then being followed by American attack helicopters, shot their four captives and abandoned five vehicles along with uniforms, equipment, and a rifle. Three soldiers were found later by Iraqi police with gunshot wounds to their chests near Bu-Alwan, a village close to Mahawil. Three were already dead (two handcuffed together in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the SUVs {{and the other on}} the ground) and the fourth showed up at nearby hospital with a gunshot wound to the head.

2500|$|The {{corpus of}} {{inscriptions}} {{is generally considered}} far too small to permit a systematic decipherment {{on the basis of}} an internal analysis of the texts. Yet already in 1946, one year after Dunand published the inscriptions, a claim for its decipherment was made, by Édouard Dhorme, a renowned Orientalist and former cryptanalyst from Paris. He noted that on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the inscribed bronze plates was a much shorter inscription ending in a row of seven nearly identical chevron-like marks, very much like our number [...] "1111111". He assumed this to be a number (probably [...] "seven", though Dhorme took it to be 4×10+3=43 because four marks were slightly larger than the other three), and guessed that the backside inscription as a whole contained a dating of the inscription.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2007 two amateur archaeologists on an ecclesiastical {{archaeology}} {{course at}} the University of Sussex unexpectedly found an ancient document giving {{the dedication of the}} church, which had been unknown since the English Reformation or before. Tony and Lesley Voice were examining documents at The National Archives in Kew, London, when they found a piece of vellum stuck to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>one.</b> It was a letter written by the Bishop of Chichester Stephen Bersted to King Edward I in 1275, indicating that the church was dedicated to Mary the Virgin. Accordingly, a rededication ceremony was held at the now redundant church on 8 December 2007, at which it was officially renamed from North Stoke Church to St Mary the Virgin Church. [...] Other discoveries made at the same time included the involvement of William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel in the medieval life of the church.|$|E
