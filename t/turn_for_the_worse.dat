5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from {{a bad case of}} gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated.

5|$|Andrić's {{wife died}} on 16 March 1968. His health {{deteriorated}} steadily and he travelled little {{in his final}} years. He continued to write until 1974, when his health took another <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> In December 1974, he was admitted to a Belgrade hospital. He soon fell into a coma, and died in the Military Medical Academy at 1:15a.m. on 13 March 1975, aged 82.

In 2013, journalist Rob Shepherd revealed, [...] "None of us in the 'Hack Pack' who followed England at the time knew that a documentary was being filmed. But Graham Taylor did." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{elections}} were held on May 14, 1989. Menem {{won by a}} wide margin, and became the new president. He was scheduled to take office on December 10, but inflation levels took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse,</b> growing into hyperinflation, causing public riots. The outgoing president Alfonsín resigned and transferred power to Menem five months early, on July 8. Menem's accession {{marked the first time}} since Hipólito Yrigoyen took office in 1916 that an incumbent government was peacefully succeeded by a president from an opposition party.|$|E
5|$|Things slowly took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> {{when former}} Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich's {{decision}} to move a division of I-DOT to Southern Illinois was overturned by his successor Pat Quinn.

Matters were exacerbated when videos of the new home for the IDOT traffic safety division being surrounded by water surfaced on YouTube in late 2007.|$|E
5|$|U.S.-Soviet {{relations}} took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> {{with the}} Soviet’s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, evidently {{for use as}} a bargaining chip in response to the August 30, 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent Gennadiy Zakharov. Since Daniloff was not engaged in espionage, Matlock advised taking a hard line with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E

Veller proclaims himself to be with the former kind.|$|R
50|$|Jan van Kessel was financially {{successful}} as his works commanded high prices. He bought in 1656 a house called the Witte en Roode Roos (White and Red Rose) in central Antwerp. By {{the time his}} wife died in 1678 his fortune seems to have <b>turned</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> In 1679 he had to mortgage his house. He had become too ill to paint and died on 17 April 1679 in Antwerp.|$|R
50|$|Then <b>the</b> weather <b>turned</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> and <b>the</b> {{abandoned}} ship {{broke into}} two pieces on 12 October 1883 {{due to the}} pounding waves building up over the Sandbank and eventually the hull disappeared under the sea. Any salvageable items were sold by public auction on 29 October 1883. Some remains of the wreck are still there, located in 5 meters deep water and it sometimes visited by local divers.|$|R
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events {{had a profound effect}} on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department, {{and one of}} the city's few honest police officers. Oldman {{described}} the character's work in cleaning up Gotham City as having left him world-weary and slightly bored, likening Gordon to a soldier who leaps at the chance to be on the front lines. His life has taken a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> since The Dark Knight; his wife has left him and taken their children, and the mayor is planning to dismiss him from his job. Gordon feels guilty over his role in covering up Harvey Dent's crimes and is prepared to resign from his position as Commissioner over it, but then senses that Gotham is about to come under threat.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with late 1987 the Caucasus {{region was}} {{experiencing}} {{a surge in}} political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations being held {{in the capital of}} Yerevan beginning in February 1988. For the fifteen months prior to the earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters, represented by the Karabakh Committee, were demanding both democracy and the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh (administered by Soviet Azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80% Armenian majority and the Azerbaijani minority) in the mountains of the Karabakh region. The unrest and the opposition movement began in September 1988 with negotiations between the Karabakh Committee and Gorbachev taking place throughout most of 1989. The relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Armenian society took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> in March and the developments climaxed in November when a state of emergency was declared, along with a nighttime curfew, and a mass movement of up to 50,000 Armenians fleeing ethnic violence arrived from Azerbaijan.|$|E
5000|$|In 1931, the Chinese {{civil war}} has {{rendered}} {{the country into}} a version of Hell, which {{a diverse group of}} Westerners must traverse by train, from Beijing to Shanghai, a voyage that <b>turns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> when General Chang's soldiers hijack the train. The story implies that Gen. Chang is a bisexual man who desires to rape the heroine, Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), and the hero, Captain Donald [...] "Doc" [...] Harvey (Clive Brook).|$|R

50|$|After their return, Beauchamp's {{personal}} life took several <b>turns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> His father Arthur died in Nelson in 1910. His only son Leslie {{was killed in}} the war in October 1915. His mother Mary died in 1917. His wife Annie's health deteriorated and she died in Wellington on 8 August 1918 aged 54y. He became estranged from his daughter Kathleen, who returned to Europe to find fame as Katherine Mansfield, but whose writings did not paint him in an overly favourable light.|$|R
5|$|In the 1250s, the {{fortunes}} of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.|$|E
5|$|Tranmere’s relegation worries {{took another}} <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> as they {{suffered}} a fourth straight defeat to sink {{back into the}} bottom two after the home encounter against Dagenham & Redbridge that saw Rovers back in the relegation zone. On 14 March Tranmere's loss at Northampton Town after a single Ryan Cresswell goal became their fifth straight defeat. Three days later Tranmere broke the losing run with an away victory at Cambridge City, thanks to Dan Gardner and Max Power goals. Later, Tranmere was outplayed 1–4 by Burton Albion at Prenton Park, in the game that marked the senior debut of 17-year old midfielder Ben Jago. Young loanee George Green's goal scored in the ninety-fourth minute cancelled Adebayo Akinfenwa's first half goal to earn Tranmere Rovers one point against Wimbledon to end March in the relegation zone, one point off survival.|$|E
5|$|While {{military}} {{efforts were}} directed to the East, the situation in Italy took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> Under their respective kings Ildibad and Eraric (both murdered in 541) and especially Totila, the Ostrogoths made quick gains. After a victory at Faenza in 542, they reconquered the major cities of Southern Italy and soon held almost the entire peninsula. Belisarius {{was sent back to}} Italy late in 544, but lacked sufficient troops. Making no headway, he was relieved of his command in 548. Belisarius succeeded in defeating a Gothic fleet with 200 ships. During this period the city of Rome changed hands three more times, first taken and depopulated by the Ostrogoths in December 546, then reconquered by the Byzantines in 547, and then again by the Goths in January 550. Totila also plundered Sicily and attacked the Greek coastlines.|$|E
50|$|After {{this initial}} success, matters <b>turned</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> Kingfish 02, crewed by Majors Thomas M. Madison and Thomas J. Sterling, flying {{aircraft}} F-105F AF Ser. No. 63-8341, {{was hit by}} anti-aircraft fire and both crewmen had to eject. Unknown to Thorsness, Kingfish 03 and 04 had been attacked by MiG-17s flying a low-altitude wagon wheel defensive formation. The afterburner {{of one of the}} F-105s wouldn't light and the element had disengaged and returned to base, leaving Kingfish 01 to fight solo.|$|R
25|$|Harvick won the pole, both at Michigan and Indianapolis. In the Irwin Tools Night Race, Harvick {{controlled}} the race early. His race however <b>turned</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> when he controversially {{made contact with}} Denny Hamlin while racing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lead. Hamlin was angry over the collision and replied by angrily throwing his HANS Device at Harvick's car. Harvick was later penalized by NASCAR for speeding on pit road, ensuring an 11th-place finish. During the Chase, Harvick {{went on to win}} the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte, giving him his third win of the season.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{after the}} rebel forces were {{defeated}} at the Battle of Guzow, Lisowski's fortunes <b>turned</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> {{and he became}} persona non grata {{in most of the}} Commonwealth, and was forced to seek refuge with the powerful Radziwiłł family. In the meantime, Muscovy's Time of Troubles were brewing, and Lisowski did not pass over the opportunity of profiting from this, as many other local magnates and noblemen already had, by meddling in Russian affairs. He soon decided he could profit best by lending his support to the Muscovite pretender, False Dmitriy II.|$|R
5|$|Davis {{completed}} A Short History of the Confederate States of America in October 1889. On November 6, he left Beauvoir {{to visit}} his plantation at Brierfield. While in New Orleans, he {{was caught in a}} sleety rain, and on the steamboat trip upriver, he had a severe cold; on November 13 he left Brierfield to return to New Orleans. Varina Davis, who had taken another boat to Brierfield, met him on the river, and he finally received some medical care; two doctors came aboard further south and found he had acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. They arrived in New Orleans three days later, and he was taken to the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Davis remained in bed but was stable for the next two weeks; however, he took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> in early December. Just when he appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and with his hand in Varina's.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{started the}} Test series against South Africa poorly. Suffering from a throat infection, he scored three in both innings and took 1/46 in an Australian victory. In the Second Test at the MCG, Miller {{performed}} consistently with bat and ball, taking 4/62 and 3/51 and scoring 52 and 31. In {{the course of}} the match, he passed the all-round double of 1000Test runs and 100Test wickets when he dismissed John Waite in the second innings, but this was not enough to prevent defeat. In the Third Test, Miller scored 55, putting on 168 with Harvey, and took 3/48 and 2/33 in an innings victory. Australia's fortunes took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Miller scored nine and injured his back after two overs with the ball. Lindwall also broke down. Without their spearheads, Australia were unable to bowl out the South Africans and match was drawn. Both were ruled out of the Fifth Test and the South Africans levelled the series despite conceding 520 runs during the first innings. Australia's bowlers were unable to stop the South African batsmen without their new ball pair.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that {{said he was in}} danger of being assassinated and his country may face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took a <b>turn</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew it would come to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E
