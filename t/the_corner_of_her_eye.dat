25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, {{in the general direction of}} her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E

60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth quivered, {{her eyes}} fell.|$|R

60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a little twitch at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R

60|$|And, blowing <b>her</b> eyes on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shawl, Maud shot {{away like}} a comic.|$|R
6000|$|Effie {{shut her}} book over her hand. [...] "It keeps me wakeful longer," [...] she whispered, {{with a glance}} at her mother from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now Dickory's {{face was}} like the sky before a shower. His mother saw it out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> but the others {{did not look at}} him.|$|E
60|$|Miss Truefitt {{appeared}} to tremble, and made {{as though to}} rise. Then she sat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thorpe-Satchell looked {{straight}} {{at him with a}} faint smile at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a quick look, and a smile quivered at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|She shrugged her shoulders, whilst a {{slightly}} contemptuous curl appeared at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir!" [...] she simpered. And then, {{bursting}} into naturalness, and glancing from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> [...] "'Tis {{the funniest thing}} under the sun! And it costs money." ...|$|E
60|$|When Miss Ophelia {{entered the}} kitchen Dinah did not rise, but smoked on in sublime tranquillity, {{regarding}} her movements obliquely out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> but apparently intent {{only on the}} operations around her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{pointed to}} the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about, {{examining}} me {{every now and then}} with <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Turning to me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly-- ...|$|E
60|$|She sighed as {{she took}} it, and a wistful smile {{invested}} <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R

60|$|Matthew had sheepishly {{unfolded}} {{the dress}} from its paper swathings {{and held it}} out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> with a rather interested air.|$|E
60|$|Miss Shott {{was passing}} {{on the other side}} of the street, and she was walking rapidly, but she could see more out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> than most people could see when they were looking {{straight}} before them at the same things.|$|E
6000|$|As he {{said this}} he looked across to Mary Lowther, who no doubt was {{watching}} every turn of his face from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "I've just been and knocked under, {{and told him that}} the old place shall be put to rights." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Riddel {{gave her}} head a toss, and {{regarded}} him from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|She became indiscreet. She {{looked at}} him with a little smile at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> black eyes. This Adrian knew too much.|$|R
6000|$|She {{gave me an}} odd glance out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "The queer thing is," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "what I wanted to say was {{something}} quite, quite different.

6000|$|She {{glanced at}} Clayton out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye.</b> Was not here a man {{trained in the}} same school of {{environment}} {{in which she had}} been trained--a man with social position and culture such as she had been taught to consider as the prime essentials to congenial association? ...|$|E
60|$|Jill {{looked out}} of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> at Derek. He was still {{occupied}} {{with the people in}} front. She turned to the man on her right.
