30|$|For {{matching}} methods, {{previous research}} on QBH was divided into bottom-up and <b>top-down</b> <b>methods</b> [13, 14]. In the bottom-up method [3 – 7, 9 – 11], the two waveforms of query humming and the target music file are locally compared. Based {{on the results of}} local matching, the optimal matching path is determined. In contrast, the global shapes of the two waveforms are compared in the <b>top-down</b> <b>methods,</b> and the local information of the waveform is also used to adjust the matching results of the global shape [2, 8, 12]. Based on this taxonomy (i.e., note-based and frame-based <b>methods,</b> bottom-up and <b>top-down</b> <b>methods),</b> previous studies can be classified as follows [13, 14].|$|R
30|$|Several {{fabrication}} {{techniques have}} been reported for Si NWs, and these can be divided in two categories: bottom-up and <b>top-down</b> <b>methods.</b> In the bottom-up methods, atoms and molecules {{can be used as}} building blocks for the nanostructures utilizing vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) technique [4], molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [5], or laser ablation [6]. The <b>top-down</b> <b>methods</b> including deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) [7, 8] and metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) [9, 10] have been introduced for nanostructures by downscaling bulk materials. Recently, a facile and high-throughput method for large-area Si NW arrays of the same dimensions has been proposed by combing MACE with nanosphere lithography (NSL) [11, 12].|$|R

30|$|Typically, the {{strategies}} for synthesizing CDs {{can be divided}} into two major categories: <b>top-down</b> and bottom-up <b>methods.</b> <b>Top-down</b> <b>methods</b> consist of laser ablation [24], arc discharge [25], and chemical oxidation [26], where the CDs are formed by cutting a large carbon structure into small pieces. In bottom-up methods, the CDs are synthesized by carbonization of organic molecular precursors through solvothermal methods [27, 28], microwave treatment [29], ultrasonic-assisted synthetic methods [30], and so on. Among them, the <b>top-down</b> <b>methods</b> often require sophisticated and expensive energy-consuming equipment [31]. The ultrasonic-assisted synthetic methods rely on strong acids or bases [30]. Typically, CDs can be synthesized within minutes by microwave irradiation, while they suffer from uncontrollable reaction conditions. The hydrothermal route is mostly preferred because of its simplicity, controlled reaction conditions, and cost-effectiveness [31].|$|R

50|$|Time-series {{segmentation}} is {{a method}} of time-series analysis in which an input time-series is divided into a sequence of discrete segments in order to reveal the underlying properties of its source. A typical application of time-series segmentation is in speaker diarization, in which an audio signal is partitioned into several pieces according to who is speaking at what times. Algorithms based on change-point detection include sliding windows, bottom-up, and <b>top-down</b> <b>methods.</b> Probabilistic methods based on hidden Markov models have also proved useful in solving this problem.|$|R
50|$|The Type II {{partnerships}} {{developed at}} the Johannesburg summit demonstrated a paradigm-shifting impact upon sustainable development discourse and the conceptualisation of global environmental governance. By addressing {{the limitations of the}} state-centric, <b>top-down</b> <b>method</b> which typified environmental governance prior to Johannesburg and facilitating the participation of private and civil actors in the governing of sustainable development, the partnerships became emblematic of the transition from command-and-control government to the informal, participatory governance mechanisms by which global environmental governance is now classified. Furthermore, the partnerships exemplify the use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level. Such factors led the World Resources Institute to declare the partnerships representative of a ‘new era’ of environmental governance.|$|E
50|$|FTA is a deductive, <b>top-down</b> <b>method</b> {{aimed at}} {{analyzing}} {{the effects of}} initiating faults and events on a complex system. This contrasts with failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), which is an inductive, bottom-up analysis method aimed at analyzing the effects of single component or function failures on equipment or subsystems. FTA {{is very good at}} showing how resistant a system is to single or multiple initiating faults. It is not good at finding all possible initiating faults. FMEA is good at exhaustively cataloging initiating faults, and identifying their local effects. It is not good at examining multiple failures or their effects at a system level. FTA considers external events, FMEA does not. In civil aerospace the usual practice is to perform both FTA and FMEA, with a failure mode effects summary (FMES) as the interface between FMEA and FTA.|$|E
50|$|Governments {{that have}} {{implemented}} the <b>top-down</b> <b>method</b> present {{the idea that}} there is a great external threat that can diminish the capabilities of a state and its citizens. The perceived threat creates an incentive that focuses policy, make elites cooperate, and facilitates the adoption of a nationalistic ideology. In an authoritarian government, political, military, and ideological power is concentrated to be conducive to policy continuation. The bureaucracies implemented are well trained, well paid, and highly competitive in recruitment and promotion. Economically successful states in East Asia have taken on programs to create infrastructure, subsidize the farming sector, provide credit, support spending on targeted research, and invest in health and education. However, most governments are non-developmental and unstable. Furthermore, even when countries have tried to pursue authoritarian strategies that have worked, specifically Brazil, a divided military, regional oligarchs in power, and vast disparities in inequality delegitimized the regime.|$|E
30|$|Several routes {{have been}} used to {{synthesize}} QDs [22] but, generally, techniques for QD synthesis used <b>top-down</b> processing <b>methods</b> and bottom-up approach. <b>Top-down</b> processing <b>methods</b> include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), ion implantation, e-beam lithography, and X-ray lithography.

40|$|An {{inconsistency}} {{is examined}} in generic <b>top-down</b> design <b>methods</b> and standards {{employed in the}} implementation of reliable software. Many design approaches adopt top-down ordering when defining the structure, interfaces, and processing of a system. However, strict adherence to a top-down sequencing does not permit accurate description of a system's error handling functions. The design of the system response to errors is becoming critical as the reliability requirements of systems increase. How <b>top-down</b> <b>methods</b> such as object oriented design and structured design do not adequately address the issues of error handling is described, and it is suggested using a bottom-up substep within these methods to eliminate the problem...|$|R

50|$|A great {{advantage}} of using self-assembling peptides to build nanostructures in a bottom-up {{approach is that}} specific features can be incorporated; the peptides can be modified and functionalized. This approach means that the final structures are built from the self-integration of small, simple building blocks. Essentially this approach is needed for nanoscale structure, as the <b>top-down</b> <b>method</b> of miniaturizing device using sophisticated lithography and etching techniques has reached a physical limit. Moreover, the top-down approach is applicable to mainly only silicon based technology, and is unable {{to be used for}} biological developments.The peptide structure is organized hierarchically into four levels. The primary structure of a peptide is the sequence of the amino acids on the peptide chain. Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore molecular recognitions that peptides are capable of. For designer self-assembling peptides both natural and non-natural amino acids are used. They link together in a controlled manner to form short peptides which links to form long polypeptide chains.|$|E
50|$|During the {{construction}} of the Verbindungsbahn section underneath tracks 1 through 3 of the Hauptbahnhof, no more than one main line track was scheduled to be taken out of service at any time. For this reason, a makeshift platform was constructed at the north-westerly track 1a, and the excavation pit was split lengthwise into two lateral pieces. Construction was done utilizing the cut-and-cover <b>top-down</b> <b>method,</b> where the outer shell was made up of a 28-metre-deep bored pile wall, on top of which the roof structure of the tunnel was built. The tracks and platforms where then reconstructed on this tunnel roof by May 1974, which meant the complete resumption of main line traffic. Underneath the roof structure, space was then excavated from the top down, and the inner shell was constructed, consisting of a floor and inner walls, which carried the roofs of up to three internal levels. On the topmost internal level, an underground parking garage with 120 spaces was built, which doubled as a civilian shelter, secure against airborne agents, such as poison gas, and nuclear attack, with a capacity for 4,500 persons. The inner shell was completed at the end of 1975.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} {{hierarchical classification}} tasks typically have {{tens of thousands}} of classes as well as a large number of samples, for which the dominant solution is the <b>top-down</b> <b>method</b> due to computational complexity.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{analyzes}} the regional impacts of changing {{a major component}} of national farm policy. Using a national-level computable general equilibrium (CGE), we estimate the national impacts of removing deficiency payments, one of the primary components of U. S. farm programs. We then use two <b>top-down</b> <b>methods</b> of regionalization to analyze the regional impacts. While both <b>top-down</b> <b>methods</b> are easy to implement, the analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the presence of local linkages in assessing regional impacts of policy changes. The analysis indicates that elimination of the deficiency payment · program would result in efficiency gains at the national level, but because of the reallocation of resources, nonmetropolitan regions would lose and metropolitan regions would gain. Estimates of the regional impacts of national-level policies such as farm programs are essential in any comprehensive policy evaluation. Virtually all economic policies affect some industries and population groups more than others. Even if a policy is formulated without regard to location, the uneven spatial dis-tribution of producing sectors and of factors of production means that regiona...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{categories}} of tree construction methods: top-down, bottom-up, and insertion <b>methods.</b> <b>Top-down</b> <b>methods</b> proceed by partitioning the input set into two (or more) subsets, bounding {{them in the}} chosen bounding volume, then keep partitioning (and bounding) recursively until each subset consists of only a single primitive (leaf nodes are reached). <b>Top-down</b> <b>methods</b> are easy to implement, fast to construct and {{by far the most}} popular, but do not result in the best possible trees in general. Bottom-up methods start with the input set as the leaves of the tree and then group two (or more) of them to form a new (internal) node, proceed in the same manner until everything has been grouped under a single node (the root of the tree). Bottom-up methods are more difficult to implement, but likely to produce better trees in general. Both <b>top-down</b> and bottom-up <b>methods</b> are considered off-line methods as they both require all primitives to be available before construction starts. Insertion methods build the tree by inserting one object at a time, starting from an empty tree. The insertion location should be chosen that causes the tree to grow as little as possible according to a cost metric. Insertion methods are considered on-line methods since they do not require all primitives to be available before construction starts and thus allow updates to be performed at runtime.|$|R

However, this <b>top-down</b> <b>method</b> has a complex procedure and is cost prohibitive for mass production. In addition, covalent oxides of Fe 3 O 4 being fragile are easily damaged during etching. In another technique, Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are synthesized first by chemical methods and then self-assemble on a substrate to form nanodot arrays [9, 10]. However, in this case, the particles have random orientations, easily aggregate, and have weak bonding force with the substrate, which make the properties quite different from those of epitaxial nanodot arrays.|$|E
