5|$|Early on 20 January, the BOM {{upgraded}} the low to {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{at which time}} it was given the name Magda.

Later that day, the small cyclone underwent a period of rapid intensification as an eye feature became apparent in satellite imagery. In response to an approaching trough, Magda tracked towards the southeast. Around 2100UTC, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Magda, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. Over the following several hours, the eye feature became increasingly defined, allowing the storm to intensify into a severe tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on 21 January. Upon reaching this strength, Magda attained ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and a barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, shear abruptly increased hours later, causing the low-level circulation of Magda to become displaced from the deepest convection.|$|E

Only the roots of the first and second cheekteeth are preserved. Both are about 1.5mm in diameter, but the first tooth may have been slightly smaller than the second.

5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more <b>than</b> <b>halfway</b> to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E

In addition to the pectoral fins, it also had two dorsal fins: a low, elongated anterior dorsal fin and a high rounded posterior dorsal fin —though the hypothesized structure of the dorsal fins varies based on the specific species of Bothriolepis and has been modified several times in the reconstructions released by researchers as new information has become available. The caudal tail was elongated, ending in a narrow band, but is unfortunately rarely preserved in fossils. Although there is no agreed upon explanation of their function, Bothriolepis also had two membranous, ventral frills located on the posterior end of the trunk carapace {{on either side of the}} tail that each have two distinct regions.

It is also required children to identify phrases not complete and therefore that are not linguistic statements. Regarding the second aspect it comes to analyzing the information on the concept expressed by a proposition, i. e. to see if it is possible to immediately assign to it a truth value, or if it is necessary to acquire a further information. Moreover we highlight the distinction between uncertainty due to incomplete information, which leads to probability assessments, and semantic uncertainty that leads to the theory of fuzzy sets...|$|R

40|$|The {{surface of}} noncarious {{cervical}} lesions (NCCLs) consists of sclerosed dentin. This type of dentin {{may affect the}} ability of adhesive restorative materials to bond well to its surface, but little information exists on the chemical nature of this dentin surface and how it may be affected during acidic treatment. The inorganic part of normal dentin and dentin from NCCLs before and after acid conditioning with phosphoric acid or polyacrylic acid was investigated. Ten premolars with NCCLs and four human third molars (control) were used. Replicas of NCCLs were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surfaces and longitudinal sections of four NCCLs and control dentin discs were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The discs and NCCLs were sectioned, and treated with 35 % phosphoric acid or 20 % polyacrylic acid/ 3 % aluminum chloride, and Raman spectra obtained. The area under phosphate ν 1 of the dentin spectrum was computed to obtain a ratio with the area under the second-order spectrum of a silicon phonon comparative standard. Mean phosphate ν 1 and silicon phonon ratios from normal dentin and NCCLs were compared using a linear model with repeated measurements and Tukey's pairwise tests. Mean ratios from different locations of the NCCLs were compared using {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) and Tukey's pairwise tests. SEM micrographs of NCCL surfaces showed variation from relatively smooth with no dentinal tubule openings to surfaces with occluded tubules. The mean phosphate ν 1 and silicon phonon ratios for NCCLs were higher than those of normal dentin in all treatment groups (P < 0. 05).
