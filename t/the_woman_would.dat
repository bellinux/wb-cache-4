5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children {{would not be allowed to}} go with her.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the Inclosure Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E
50|$|He {{explained}} that from arrival at Treblinka {{to death in}} the gas chambers took 2-3 hours for a trainload of people. They <b>would</b> undress, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> have their hair cut, then they would wait naked outside, including during the winter in minus 10-20 C, until there was room in the gas chamber. Suchomel told Lanzmann that he would ask the hairdressers to slow down so that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> not have to wait so long outside.|$|R
50|$|The Yirrganydji were a {{hunter-gatherer}} society. They {{would move}} about {{from place to}} place within their traditional country following the seasons and food resources. Men would hunt for the large game and fish, while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> gather and prepare <b>the</b> plant foods. <b>Women</b> <b>would</b> also be <b>the</b> predominant caretakers of the children.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, {{if there}} was going to be a messy stunt, the husband would come out dressed in a plastic jumpsuit. Similarly, wives would {{sometimes}} play in their [...] "street clothes", but sometimes <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> appear in a jumpsuit due to the fact that their own clothing might be too cumbersome or perhaps fragile. The women's jumpsuits, unlike the men's, which were rather plain, were patterned to look like a pair of overalls with a collared blouse underneath. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>would</b> also often be issued running shoes instead of their own high heels.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the continual}} bleeding, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> have been {{continually}} regarded in Jewish {{law as a}} niddah or menstruating woman, and so ceremonially unclean. In order {{to be regarded as}} clean, the flow of blood would need to stop for at least 7 days. Because of the constant bleeding, this woman lived in a continual state of uncleanness which would have brought upon her social and religious isolation.|$|E
25|$|Callimachus {{talked of}} a myth where Ino's son Melikertes washed up dead in Tenedos after being {{thrown into the}} sea by his mother, who killed herself too; the residents, Lelegians, built an altar for Melikertes and started a ritual of a woman sacrificing her infant child when the town's need was dire. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> then be blinded. The myths also added that the custom was {{abolished}} when Orestes' descendants settled the place.|$|E
25|$|Following Ukutwala, the {{man will}} then be in {{discussion}} with his parents or relatives to inform them of his choice in bride. During this discussion the clan name, isiduko, of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be revealed and researched. If it were found that {{the woman and the}} man share the same clan name they {{would not be allowed to}} proceed with the marriage as it is said that people with the same clan name are of the same relation and cannot be wed.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man {{without the consent of}} her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements {{as if she had been}} given by her kin.|$|E
25|$|The Nair {{traditionally}} practised certain rituals {{relating to}} births, although often {{only for those}} of the first-born. Of these, pulicudi was the most significant to them. This involved rubbing coconut oil into the pregnant woman, followed by bathing, formal dressing, consultation with an astrologer regarding the expected date of birth and a ceremonial drinking of tamarind juice, dripped along the blade of a sword. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> also select a grain, from which it was believed possible to determine {{the gender of the}} child. This ritual was performed in front of the community and contained many symbolic references; for example, the use of the sword was believed to make the child a warrior.|$|E
25|$|Oral sex alone cannot {{result in}} {{pregnancy}} and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of contraception. For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, {{there is no}} connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system, and sperm ingested by <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be killed and broken down by acids in her stomach and proteins in the small intestine. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, {{there is a potential}} risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.|$|E

25|$|For Taoists, sex was {{not just}} about {{pleasing}} the man. The woman also had to be stimulated and pleased in order {{to benefit from the}} act of sex. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishinpō, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women {{had a great deal of}} strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period.|$|E
25|$|Victor Von Doom {{was born}} decades ago to a tribe of Latverian Romani {{people under the}} rule of an unnamed nobleman called the Baron. Victor's mother was witch Cynthia Von Doom who died by Mephisto's hand while Von Doom was young. His father, Werner, was the leader of the tribe and a renowned {{medicine}} man who kept his wife's sorceress life quiet in order to protect Victor from a similar fate. Soon after Cynthia's death, the Baron's wife grew incurably ill from cancer and Werner was called to the capitol to heal her. When she succumbed to illness, the Baron labeled Werner a murderer and called for his death. Werner escaped with young Victor, having realized the night before <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> die. He goes on to die of exposure on the mountainside, cradling the boy in a final embrace and giving him his garments to keep him warm. Victor survived and, on return to the Romani camp, discovered his mother's occult instruments and swore revenge on the Baron. Victor grew into a headstrong and brilliant man, combining sorcery and technology to create fantastic devices which would keep the Baron's men at bay and protect the Roma people. His exploits attracted the attention of the dean of Empire State University, who sent someone to the camp. Offered the chance to study in the United States, Von Doom chooses to leave his homeland and his love, Valeria, behind.|$|E
25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E

25|$|A {{description}} of sati {{appears in the}} Greek 1st-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus's account of the war fought in Iran between two of Alexander the Great's generals, Eumenes of Cardia and Antigonus Monophthalmus. In 317 BC Eumenes' cosmopolitan army defeated that of Antigonus in the Battle of Paraitakene. Among the fallen was one Ceteus, the commander of Eumenes' Indian soldiers. Diodorus writes that Ceteus had been followed on campaign by his two wives, at his funeral the two wives competed for the honour of joining their husband on the pyre. After the older wife {{was found to be}} pregnant, Eumenes' generals ruled in favour of the younger. She was led to the pyre crowned in garlands to the hymns of her kinsfolk. The whole army then marched three times around the pyre before it was lit. According to Diodorus the practice of sati started because Indians married for love, unlike the Greeks who favoured marriages arranged by the parents. When inevitably many of these love marriages turned sour, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> often poison the husband and find a new lover. To end these murders, a law was therefore instituted that the widow should either join her husband in death or live in perpetual widowhood. Modern historians believe Diodorus' source for this episode was the eyewitness account of the now lost historian Hieronymus of Cardia. Hieronymus' explanation of the origin of sati appears to be his own composite, created from a variety of Indian traditions and practices to form a moral lesson upholding traditional Greek values.|$|E
500|$|The 19th-century {{antiquarian}} Angharad Llwyd, {{who wrote}} a history of Anglesey in 1833, recorded the story noted by Gerald of Wales in the late 12th century that the church once possessed a stone [...] "resembling a human thigh" [...] which would return [...] "of its own accord" [...] however far away it was carried. It was sometimes known as the [...] "homing stone". Gerald said that Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester (who died in 1101) had tested this story by throwing the stone into the sea, chained to a large rock, {{only to discover that}} the stone had returned by the next morning. As a result, the Norman earl issued an order that no-one was to attempt to move it. [...] It was popularly believed that if a couple had sexual intercourse near the stone (something that Gerald said happened [...] "frequently"), it would [...] "sweat large drops of water" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> not become pregnant. Henry Rowlands wrote that the stone had been stolen from the wall of the churchyard (into which it had been set) during his time at St Nidan's.|$|E
500|$|Within the Holy Roman Empire, {{in article}} 131 of the 1532 Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, the {{following}} punishment was stated for women {{found guilty of}} infanticide. Generally, they [...] should be drowned, but the law code allowed for, in particularly severe cases, that the old punishment could be implemented. That is, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be buried alive, and then a stake would be driven through her heart. Similarly, burial alive, combined with transversal impalement is attested as an early execution method for people found guilty of adultery. For example, from the 1348 statutes of Zwickau, it seems that an adulterous couple could be punished in the following way: They were {{to be placed on}} top of each other in a grave, with a layer of thorns between them. Then, a single stake was to be hammered through them. A similar punishment by impalement for a proven male adulterer is mentioned in a 13th-century ordinance for Bohemian mining town Iglau, whereas in a 1340 Vienna statute, the husband of a woman caught in flagrante in adultery could, if he wished to, demand that his wife and her lover be impaled, alternatively demand a monetary restitution. Occasionally, women found guilty of witchcraft have been condemned to be impaled. In 1587 Kiel, 101-year-old Sunde Bohlen was, on being condemned as a witch, buried alive, and afterwards had a stake driven through her heart.|$|E

[...] If the women tested positive, they were referred to substance abuse counseling and threatened with prosecution. [...] The {{hospital staff}} acknowledged that the [...] "threat of law enforcement intervention... provided the necessary leverage to make the policy effective." [...] Women who tested positive a second time were arrested, even before giving birth. [...] If the positive test occurred prior to the 28th week of pregnancy, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>would</b> be charged with simple possession.
