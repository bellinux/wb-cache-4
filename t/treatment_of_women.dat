She believes {{that there is a}} link between the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and animals in society. In August 2014, Autumn said she had developed copper toxicity and was no longer vegan. She cares for two pet rats, Sir Edward and Basil, and a cat named Fish/Fishy, and endorses companies such as Manic Panic and Samson Tech.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{feminism}} in India {{can be divided}} into three phases: the first phase, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, initiated when male European colonists began to speak out against the social evils of Sati; the second phase, from 1915 to Indian independence, when Gandhi incorporated women's movements into the Quit India movement and independent women's organisations began to emerge; and finally, the third phase, post-independence, which has focused on fair <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> at home after marriage, in the work force and right to political parity.|$|E

5|$|The poet Eka Budianta {{notes that}} {{a common theme}} in Soeman's works was the {{strength}} of love {{and its ability to}} overcome obstacles. Soeman wrote of the power of romance and marriage for love in response to the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in adat (traditional) culture. Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father. Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands. Similarly, Soeman used Kasih Tak Terlarai to criticize the mistreatment of orphans after adoption.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{the number of}} anemia cases has {{increased}} more than 6 -fold. Unfortunately, the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> pregnant <b>women</b> with anemia using an iron supplement gives unsatisfactory results. However, {{the data from the}} present study can change situation for the better. This conclusion was derived from a comparative analysis <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> 65 pregnant <b>women</b> suffering from anemia, divided into two groups: the study and control groups. Patients of the study group received, along with standard therapy, courses of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). Evaluation <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> efficiency was based on data from laboratory methods, Doppler, and cardiotocography before and after treatment, as well as a morphological study of the placenta.

25|$|Because Regeneration is a {{novel that}} focuses on the First World War, it explores many of the themes common to {{literature}} written during and following the war, including the cause and effects of war, the limits of ideologies like nationalism and masculinity, and both the medical and popular reactions to the psychological traumas created in the war. Critics have treated each of these extensively. Moreover, because much of Barker's earlier work was historical fiction about women, critics often comment on her <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the novel.|$|E
