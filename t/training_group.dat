40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how physical training brings about changes in erythrocyte count, haematocrit value and haemoglobin amount during the lapse of weeks after the termination of physical training with different intensities. 148 young male mice were divided into an untrained <b>group</b> and three <b>trained</b> <b>groups.</b> They were mildly, moderately and exhaustively trained on the treadmill for 10 weeks at the rate of 5 days per week.

5|$|As in the First World War, white Rhodesians {{volunteered for}} the forces readily and in large numbers. Over 2,700 had come forward before the war was three weeks old. Somewhat ironically, the Southern Rhodesian recruiters' main problem was not {{sourcing}} manpower but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home. Manpower controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs. The SRAF accepted 500 recruits {{in the days following}} the outbreak of war, prompting its commander Group Captain CW Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons.
