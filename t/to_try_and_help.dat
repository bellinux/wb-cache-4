5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented as a way <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

With his {{brothers in the}} middle of a three way feud for the WWF Tag Team Championship with the Hardy Boyz and Edge & Christian, Dudley frequently battled with Lita and Rhyno <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> their respective team win (Lita managed The Hardy Boyz while Rhyno managed Edge & Christian). Notably all three interfered in the Tables, Ladders and Chairs (TLC) match at WrestleMania X-Seven.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2009, [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land" [...] and its b-side [...] "Fun Stuff" [...] {{were made}} {{available}} for streaming on the FactCat website. A video for [...] "Swim Until You Can't See Land", which featured flickering flashlights, was made available on 16 October, and the single was {{made available for}} digital download on 16 November and on seven-inch vinyl on 7 December. Alongside {{the announcement of the}} album's title on Scottish music blog, The Pop Cop, the band unveiled a fifth member, Gordon Skene, formerly of Make Model. Later, NME confirmed the band would be playing a special intimate show in London to celebrate Skene's arrival. Similar to Andy Monaghan's entry into the band in early 2008, Skene was not involved in recording the album. Upon his arrival, Hutchison noted that [...] "it must be difficult for him coming into something that four other people were involved in studio-wise. He's not seen any of that process yet. He's coming in playing these songs that perhaps he likes, but doesn't have that same level of connection with, so I think one of the aims [...] is <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> build that for him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Try to help it! Try <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> it! Say a {{word that}} you will perhaps help it by-and-bye." [...] Then there came a dark frown upon her brow,--not, indeed, from anger, but from a feeling that so terrible a task should be thrown upon her. [...] "I know you think that I am common." ...|$|E
50|$|Later {{the group}} is cornered by a river. Allie is captured, but Billy agrees to {{exchange}} her for the medallion. After the exchange, the kids jump over a waterfall to avoid capture.

5000|$|A {{crowd of}} spectators {{stood on the}} beach. Some came to watch, others <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>and</b> yet others were hoping to loot the cargo that was being washed ashore. A {{detachment}} of soldiers was in attendance to keep order amongst the spectators. Corporal Christian Ludwig Woltemade, the youngest son of the elderly Wolraad, was amongst those standing guard. As daylight came, Wolraad left his home, Klein Zoar [...] on horseback, taking provisions to his son.|$|R

"And that wasn’t {{the only}} unpleasantness, {{and at last}} some of the chaps put their ’eads {{together}} and agreed among theirselves <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> Job Brown {{to give up the}} drink.

Foolish person! Sit down in that great easy-chair and draw it up to the fire." ...|$|E
60|$|Wolfersdorf, at Wittenberg or farther on, had a {{flattering}} {{word from}} the King; applauding his effective procedures at Torgau; and ordering him, should Wittenberg fall (as it did, August 23d), to join Wunsch, who is coming with a small Party <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> in those destitute localities. Wunsch the King had detached (21st August), as we heard already. Finck the King finds, farther, that he can detach (from Waldau Country, September 7th); [Tempelhof, iii. 211, 237.] Russians being so languid, and Saxony fallen into such a perilous predicament.|$|E

50|$|Psychology. Psychologists use {{a variety}} of {{interviewing}} methods <b>and</b> techniques <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> understand <b>and</b> <b>help</b> their patients. In a psychiatric interview, a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a psychiatric assessment. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called couple interviews. Criminologists and detectives sometimes use cognitive interviews on eyewitnesses <b>and</b> victims <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> ascertain what can be recalled specifically from a crime scene, hopefully before the specific memories begin to fade in the mind.|$|R

If you saw another man holding a position you wanted yourself, would you throw him out, if you could, by sheer force, or would you think of your laws and your morals?" ...|$|E
60|$|Malloring turned {{abruptly}} {{and went down}} the path. Fuss! He never fussed. Fuss! The word was an insult, addressed to him! If {{there was one thing}} he detested more than another, whether in public or private life, it was 'fussing.' Did he not belong to the League for Suppression of Interference with the Liberty of the Subject? Was he {{not a member of the}} party notoriously opposed to fussy legislation? Had any one ever used the word in connection with conduct of his, before? If so, he had never heard them. Was it fussy <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>help</b> the Church to improve the standard of morals in the village? Was it fussy to make a simple decision and stick to it? The injustice of the word really hurt him. And the more it hurt him, the slower and more dignified and upright became his march toward his drive gate.|$|E

Suddenly someone calls out he sees the cable at the bottom: there it was sure enough, apparently wriggling about as the waves rippled. Great excitement; still greater when we find our own anchor is foul of it and has been the means of bringing it to light. We let go a grapnel, get the cable clear of the anchor on to the grapnel - the captain in an agony lest we should drift ashore meanwhile - hand the grappling line into the big boat, steam out far enough, and anchor again. A little more work and one end of the cable is up over the bows round my drum. I go to my engine and we start hauling in. All goes pretty well, but it is quite dark.
