40|$|The PC motif is {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{together with}} <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 domain, a binding {{partner of the}} PC motif-containing protein. For interaction with <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 domain, <b>the</b> PC motif-containing region (PCCR) comprising the PC motif and its flanking regions is required. Because <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 domain and the PCCR are novel binding modules found {{in a variety of}} signaling proteins, their structural and functional characterization is crucial. Bem 1 p and Cdc 24 p interact through <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 –PCCR interaction and regulate cell polarization in budding yeast. Here, we determined a tertiary structure of the PCCR of Cdc 24 p by NMR. The tertiary structure of the PCCR {{is similar to that of}} <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 domain of Bem 1 p, which is classified into a ubiquitin fold. The PC motif portion takes a compact ββα-fold, presented on the ubiquitin scaffold. Mutational studies indicate that <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 –PCCR interaction is mainly electrostatic. Based on the structural information, we group <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 domains and the PCCRs into a novel family, named <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 family. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 1 family proteins form a specific dimer with each other...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> perineal body (<b>PB)</b> {{is poorly}} understood. In abdominoperineal {{excision}} (APE), {{there is no}} natural dissection plane through <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> Knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> is essential to avoid straying in to incorrect planes leading to tumour perforation and unnecessary urogenital and anorectal injuries. This study describes the anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> and <b>the</b> implications for APE. Six human adult cadaveric specimens (three males, three females) {{were obtained from the}} Leeds GIFT Research Tissue Programme. Paran-embedded mega-blocks containing <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> were produced and serially sectioned at 50 and 250 µm intervals. Sections were stained to reveal collagen and elastin, and with an antibody against α-smooth muscle actin. <b>The</b> <b>PB</b> is formed of a bromuscular mass, which was thicker and wider in female specimens compared to males, extending from the external anal sphincter to the rectogenital septum. Muscles from the urogenital diaphragm and anterior rectal wall anchored into <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> <b>The</b> longitudinal muscle (LM) of the rectal muscularis propria extended in anterolateral directions and intertwined with the somatic pelvic oor muscles to create strong xation of the anorectum. The LM plays a dominant role in the formation of <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> Surgeons {{should be aware of the}} complex course of the LM through <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> to prevent injuries to the urogenital organs and perforation of the anterior rectal wall.

40|$|Aim: Dissection of <b>the</b> perineal body (<b>PB)</b> during abdominoperineal {{excision}} (APE) for low {{rectal cancer}} {{is often difficult}} {{due to the lack}} of a natural plane of dissection. Understanding <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> and its relation to the anorectum is essential to permit safe dissection during the perineal phase of the operation and avoid damage to the anorectum and urogenital organs. This study describes the anatomy and histology of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> relevant to APE. Method: Six human adult cadaver pelvic exenteration specimens (three male, three female) from the Leeds GIFT Research Tissue Programme were studied. Paraffin-embedded mega-blocks were produced and serially sectioned at 50 - and 250 -μm intervals. Sections were stained by immunohistochemistry to show collagen, elastin and smooth muscle. Results: <b>The</b> <b>PB</b> was cylindrically shaped in the male specimens and wedge-shaped in the female ones. Although centrally located between the anal and urogenital triangles, it was nearly completely formed by muscle fibres derived from the rectal muscularis propria. Thick bundles of smooth muscle, mostly arising from the longitudinal muscle, inserted into <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> and levator ani muscle (LAM). The recto-urethralis muscle originated from <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> and separated <b>the</b> anterolateral <b>PB</b> from <b>the</b> urogenital organs. Conclusion: Smooth muscle fibres derived from the rectal muscularis propria extend into <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> and LAM and appear to fix the anorectum. Dissection of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> during APE is safe only when the smooth muscle fibres that extend into <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> are divided...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>PB</b> 2 subunit of the {{influenza}} virus RNA polymerase {{is a major}} virulence determinant of {{influenza virus}}es. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. It was previously shown that <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 protein, {{in addition to its}} nuclear localization, also accumulates in the mitochondria. Here, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 protein interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, MAVS (also known as IPS- 1, VISA, or Cardif), and inhibits MAVS-mediated beta interferon (IFN-beta) expression. In addition, we show that PB 2 proteins of influenza viruses differ in their abilities to associate with the mitochondria. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 proteins of seasonal human influenza viruses localize to <b>the</b> mitochondria while <b>PB</b> 2 proteins of avian influenza viruses are nonmitochondrial. This difference in localization is caused by a single amino acid polymorphism in <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 mitochondrial targeting signal. In order to address the functional significance of the mitochondrial localization of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 protein in vivo, we have generated two recombinant human influenza viruses encoding either mitochondrial or nonmitochondrial PB 2 proteins. We found that the difference in the mitochondrial localization of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 proteins does not affect the growth of these viruses in cell culture. However, the virus encoding <b>the</b> nonmitochondrial <b>PB</b> 2 protein induces higher levels of IFN-beta and, in an animal model, is attenuated compared to the isogenic virus encoding a mitochondrial PB 2. Overall this study implicates <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 protein in the regulation of host antiviral innate immune pathways and suggests an important role for the mitochondrial association of <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> 2 protein in determining virulence...|$|R

Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> from <b>the</b> fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure {{was due to}} the fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> or to changes in the environment unrelated to <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside <b>the</b> <b>PB.</b> Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within <b>the</b> <b>PB</b> are lower than in the late 1980 s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors.
