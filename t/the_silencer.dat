5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside <b>the</b> <b>silencer,</b> it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on <b>the</b> <b>silencer.</b> In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on <b>the</b> <b>silencer.</b> Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of <b>the</b> <b>silencer,</b> the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Silencers</b> is an American spy film spoof {{motion picture}} {{released}} in 1966 and starring Dean Martin as agent Matt Helm.

5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With <b>the</b> <b>silencer,</b> the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as <b>the</b> <b>silencer,</b> attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside <b>the</b> <b>silencer.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>silencer</b> {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The {{prosecution}} said the blood had come from Sheila's head when <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|Bamber brought 16 {{issues to}} the {{attention}} of the court. Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence. The defence withdrew ground 11 ("the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant").|$|E
5|$|The rifle, without <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> or sights attached, {{was lying}} on her body {{pointing}} up at her neck. June's Bible {{lay on the floor}} to the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June's fingerprints were on it, as were others that could not be identified, including one made by a child.|$|E

5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They argued that <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> {{might not have}} been used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} {{ties and}} inheritance issues within {{the immediate and}} extended family added a layer of complexity to the case. Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It {{was one of those}} cousins who found <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> in the gun cupboard after the murders, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> in the cupboard. One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with what {{appeared}} to be flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The police {{searched the}} gun {{cupboard}} {{on the day}} of the murders but found nothing. Three days later, on 10 August, Bamber's extended family visited the farm with Basil Cock, the estate's executor. During that visit, one of the cousins, David Boutflour, found <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> and rifle sights in the gun cupboard. The court heard that this was witnessed by Boutflour's father and sister, as well as by Basil Cock and the farm secretary.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with <b>the</b> <b>silencer</b> off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} {{passed to the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) when it was {{established}} in 1997 to review alleged miscarriages of justice.

The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002 at the Royal Courts of Justice by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges said that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right.|$|E
