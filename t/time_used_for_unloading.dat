5000|$|The {{name comes}} from this area being <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> ships with {{supplies}} for Akershus fortress after the founding of Christiania, (now Oslo). The word [...] "lade" [...] means to load in this context.|$|R
5000|$|The Gare Saint-Lazare {{was built}} in 1837. An alley, the [...] "Impasse Bony", created in 1826 and located {{at the site of}} the Hotel Terminus, was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> luggage.The Cour de Rome, in front of the station on the west side, {{encompassed}} the old [...] "Impasse d’Argenteuil", which opened onto the Rue du Rocher.|$|R
2500|$|In mid-1942, {{both the}} Krupp and Dortmunder prototypes were {{shipped to the}} Channel Islands and {{installed}} together off Alderney, where they were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> materials needed to fortify the island. Referred to as the [...] "German jetty" [...] by local inhabitants, they remained standing for the next thirty-six years until demolition crews finally removed them in 1978–79, a testament to their durability.|$|R
50|$|From 1767, a {{tidal basin}} {{in the area}} that would become the dock was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> copper <b>for</b> a {{smelting}} works. Between 1794 and 1841 it was the site of a pottery. In 1864, a new dock designed by George Fosbery Lyster was blasted from the foreshore, providing two graving docks. This dock opened in 1866. Ten years later, a third graving dock was added.|$|R
50|$|The port of Mostaganem {{is being}} <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> {{of all sorts}} of cargo, ranging from {{provisions}} to cars and pipelines. As in most ports of Algeria, it is not allowed to sailors to exit the port and visit the city. The port is being shared by large transport vessels and fishing boats alike. A new, smaller port for fishing boats has been constructed, but is currently not used.|$|R
50|$|The jetty {{was also}} <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the <b>unloading</b> of fencing materials, cement, stock, cornsacks, {{and all the}} {{necessary}} items needed for a new settlement.|$|R
50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> certain railroad cars such as hopper cars, gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) <b>for</b> <b>unloading,</b> gondola cars allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R
50|$|After {{the decline}} in {{coal-fired}} steamships, the dock continued to export coal. Following the demise of coal mining in South Lancashire, {{and most of the}} UK, the export market for coal dissolved with the dock ceasing coal exports in 1988. The dock is still commercially active with one of the original 1848 transit sheds still in use. Two other quays are <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> aggregates. The port's Svitzer tugs are based, with their home berths, in the dock.|$|R
50|$|From 18 June 1965 {{the station}} became the {{terminus}} of a seasonal motorail service from London, the end loading dock behind the former main (Up side) platform being <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> the cars. Early photographs show the station building to be shorter {{than it is}} today, with the extension carried out along with refurbishment for motorail traffic. Motorail kept the station in use each summer season until the regular service ended on 19 September 1980 and the occasional peak service on 16 September 1982.|$|R
50|$|The {{main station}} {{buildings}} {{are on the}} Down side. At {{the end of the}} Down side platform is a bay for the New Guildford Line. There are now three islands with seven platform faces plus the bay linked by both a long footbridge and a subway. Platforms 6 and 7 are opposite sides of the same line: these were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> mail and parcels until the mid-1990s. The station was completely rebuilt (except for the platforms) by British Rail in the late 1980s.|$|R
5|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across on D+1 and the structures were in <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by the British, the other at Omaha by the Americans. Severe storms on 19 June interrupted the landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The repaired Arromanches harbour was able to receive around 6,000 tons of materiel daily and was in continuous <b>use</b> <b>for</b> the next ten months, but most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.|$|R

50|$|William F. Burden {{was born}} 14 March 1830 in Troy, New York, the third son of Henry and Helen Burden. Burden {{attended}} Troy Polytechnic Institute (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). The steam derricks, <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> coal, at the Burden Iron Works were designed William. A wire cable stretched between, on which an iron carriage traveled three hundred {{feet from the}} dock to the coal heap, carrying a self-dumping bucket with the capacity to hold a ton of coal.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has investigated}} whether {{a combination of}} DEM and MBD can be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> a reliable and accurate environment <b>for</b> predicting grab <b>unloading</b> performance. A grab {{is a type of}} bulk material handling equipment <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> materials such as coal and iron ore from vessel to shore. Both a grab and iron ore pellets have been modelled and coupled into a co-simulation. Particle stiffness reductions and coarse graining techniques have been developed and applied to reduce computational costs. The developed large scale coupled grab-pellets model compared very well with validation experiments conducted on a bulk terminal with a scissors grab. A demonstration of virtual prototyping of grabs showed that when this model is implemented in the grab design process significant improvements in grab performance can be achieved.

50|$|Today, Deep Cove {{serves as}} the {{starting}} point for Doubtful Sound cruises on tour boats stationed at a small wharf in Wanganella Cove, within Deep Cove. The full-day tours depart from Manapouri by boat to travel across Lake Manapouri, followed by a bus ride over Wilmot Pass, and return the same way after the boat tour in Doubtful Sound. The wharf in Deep Cove is also <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> large components such as transformers from barges, to be delivered to the Manapouri Power Station via Wilmot Pass, as there is no other road access to the power plant and these components would be too large to ferry across Lake Manapouri from the other side.|$|R

A wire cable stretched between, on which an iron carriage traveled three hundred feet from the dock to the coal heap, carrying a self-dumping bucket with the capacity to hold a ton of coal. A steam engine hoisted the filled bucket to the cable, along which it traveled {{to the point where}} the tilting apparatus overturned its contents upon the pile. Alongside the coal heaps were vast deposits of iron ore, mostly from the area of Lake Champlain. There were also piles of limestone, from the downstream city of Hudson, used as [...] "flux" [...] to help in the fusion of the ores.|$|R
50|$|Although, {{in later}} years, the colliers faced {{competition}} from the railways in supplying coal <b>for</b> domestic <b>use</b> in the capital, large quantities of coal were used at the numerous power stations {{on the banks of}} the River Thames, and wharves were constructed alongside them <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> the colliers. The wharf at Battersea Power Station is still extant, and the cranes <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> the coal can be seen on the riverfront. These are fitted with clamshell buckets and in operation loaded a hopper, which in turn fed a conveyor system leading to the power station's coal bunkers. The modern equivalent can be seen at the Tyne Coal Terminal, unloading bulk carriers. Gas Light and Coke Company had similar facilities at its large gasworks, also alongside the Thames, for handling the large quantity of bituminous coal which was needed to supply the capital with town gas.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} beaches of Wheelers Bay and Horseshoe Bay were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the <b>unloading</b> of provisions, {{particularly}} coal. Boats would beach at high tide and the cargo off-loaded onto horsedrawn carts. The boats would then be floated off again at the next high tide.|$|R
50|$|In British English, a dock is an {{enclosed}} area of water <b>used</b> <b>for</b> loading, <b>unloading,</b> building or repairing ships. Such a dock may {{be created by}} building enclosing harbour walls into an existing natural water space, or by excavation within what would otherwise be dry land.|$|R
50|$|In addition, a wide wharf was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{loading and}} <b>unloading</b> goods from barges plying on the {{waterways}} between Vistula and Oder.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} an agent-based simulation {{as a tool}} for decision making about automatic warehouses management. The proposed multi-agent system is going to be used in a real environment within a project developed with a company working on logistics. More in details, we have developed a simulation framework in order to study problems, constraints and performance issues of the truck unload operations. We aim to optimize the suitable number of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> containers arrived to the warehouse. This is a critical issue since an AGV is a costly resource and an augment in number does not necessarily correspond to an improved unloading speed. The experiment performed with our simulated environment allows us also to evaluate the impact of other elements to the performance. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{west end}} of the {{neighborhood}} is Howard Park, the largest urban park in West Palm Beach. Howard Park contains the historic Stub Canal Turning Basin, originally <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> crops grown to the west, including the central portions of the state near Lake Okeechobee, for shipment to the North. At the time, the land just across the canal from the park remained undeveloped marshlands, and was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> hunting. During the land-boom era, Howard Park was <b>used</b> as camp <b>for</b> settlers, including tent-sites, running water, and out-houses provided by the city. This camp was later converted to a Boy Scout camp, and is {{the location of the}} present-day dog park. Some tourists and settlers would alternatively rent apartments located over garages in the neighborhood, providing additional income to residents. The historic Art Deco style Armory building was built in 1939 with WPA funds <b>for</b> <b>use</b> by the National Guard. It currently houses the Armory Arts Center, which includes an art school and galleries.|$|R
25|$|Mr Williams also {{financed the}} new quay at Velator, which opened around 1870. The quay was {{sufficient}} for ships {{of up to}} 130 tons, and continued to be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> gravel until the 1960s. At {{the same time as}} the opening of the quay, repairs were required to some of the embankments on the new cut, which were subsiding as a result of the material on which they were constructed. In 1910, the North Devon Coast was hit by severe storms, and the embankments around Horsey Island were breached in several places. A breach also occurred in the walls of the new cut, with local newspapers describing a boat passing through the breach onto the marsh, and back out again when the tide turned, but few other details are known, as contemporary sources were more concerned with the task of repairing the embankments around Horsey Island.|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that giving field units computers {{connected with the}} computer-aided dispatch, or another enterprise system <b>used</b> <b>for</b> dispatch, <b>unloads</b> voice two-way radio channels and increases capacity. Users research information on their terminal or laptop instead of calling in with a request that the dispatcher do it. One source suggests radio traffic drops by 30% when computers are available to mobile users.|$|R
25|$|The {{middle bay}} was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> hay wagons, {{threshing}} (thrashing) grain and other work. The foundation was typically not quarried stone but fieldstone {{and had no}} basement thus are called a ground barn. The timbers used were typically one solid piece running {{the full length of}} the building sometimes over forty feet long. The cows often stood on the ground rather than on a wood floor, their heads facing the middle bay in what is called a tie-up (not individual box stalls). Also the breeds of cows were usually smaller than today. English barns were built before the New England practice of connecting the barn to the house was popular so these barns are usually separate from the house although they could have been connected to the house at a later date. Houses and barns in New England built before the early 19th century typically face south rather than facing a road, the later orientation.|$|R
60|$|Docks are {{not only}} <b>used,</b> however, <b>for</b> {{repairing}} and building ships.

50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the station {{is that it has}} a second {{platform}} for eastbound trains. When the station was the line's terminus, this was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> quicker <b>unloading</b> of passengers who were traveling from the centre to save the congestion in the small vestibules during peak hours (which were operating entry only). However, after the extension to Lisova in 1979, the passenger traffic fell rapidly and this arrangement was discontinued, although the platform itself remains.|$|R

500|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across the Channel on D+1 and the structures were in <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>unloading</b> by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by British forces, the other at Omaha by American forces. A severe storm on 19 June destroyed the Omaha harbour. The Arromanches harbour was repaired and remained in <b>use</b> <b>for</b> the next ten months, with a maximum capacity of [...] of stores per day. Of the British supplies landed in Normandy {{by the end of}} August, [...] via the Mulberry harbour and [...] in via the small harbours at Port-en-Bessin and Courseulles-sur-Mer. Most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July. The most important use of the Mulberry harbour was the unloading of heavy machinery that could not be brought across the beaches. Artificial breakwaters (Gooseberries) sheltered hundreds of ships during the storm of 17–23 June, and provided shelter <b>for</b> craft <b>unloading</b> stores at Juno and Sword. A joint Anglo-American oil depot was constructed at Port-en-Bessin, fed via buoyed pipes known as [...] "Tombola" [...] from oil tankers moored offshore. Using this method, [...] of petrol (half for the Second Army) was delivered by the end of August, by which time the underwater pipelines constructed in Operation Pluto were ready.|$|R
