50|$|A {{pattern of}} {{background}} factors {{contributes to the}} attacks. There is typically an unsuspected relatively low blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet {{in the absence of}} any salt-retaining tendency. Heat causes vaso-dilation and worsens the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, needle phobia), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>requirement</b> because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is always modulated by vagal outflow, in these cases leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response.

However, since UML is not a formal model, direct evaluation of software architecture is not possible, directly. On the other hand, evaluating software architecture in initial phases helps us consider more requirements and it reduces designing expenditures. Therefore, converting pragmatic model to formal model is necessary for software architecture evaluation. For evaluating software architecture and making an executive model, using color Petri net are useful because of simplicity, high capability and enhancing theoretical mathematics. Using language variables and fuzzy logic causes a higher accuracy in computations associated with efficiency evaluation. In this paper, we present fuzzy logic and reaction analysis before implementation, which can improve efficiency of design problems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{design of}} a high voltage, high power and high {{frequency}} transformer is introduced considering its operation in the LCC resonant converter. The leakage inductance and winding capacitance of the transformer are used as the resonant elements. An additional series resonant capacitor is added to form the LCC topology. The discontinuous current mode (DCM) is adopted to achieve the ZCS turn-on and ZVZCS turn-off of the power switches. Smaller value of the winding capacitance is preferred because it {{has the effect of}} decreasing the peak value of the resonant current at almost the same output voltage. The theoretic calculation of the winding capacitance and leakage inductance of the transformer is given. The error between the theoretical calculation and practical measurement is within 15 %. So optimization design of the parasitic resonant elements can be achieved <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>requirement</b> of the circuit. A prototype of LCC resonant converter with 60 kW and 60 kV output is built based on the designed transformer. Experiment results are given.

The common finite element commercial software ANSYS is used to for this numerical analysis. A body-centered cubic particle arrangement model are constructed to simulate the microstructure of the composite with 60 vol. % diamond. The effect of particle size and inhomogeneous interfacial conductance on the thermal conductivity of diamond particles reinforced aluminum composite is investigated. Cubo-octahedral particles are assumed and interfacial thermal conductance between different diamond faces and aluminum matrix is implemented by real constants of contact element. The {{results show that the}} numerical results using present model agree reasonably well with the experimentation. Taking into consideration the interfacial thermal conductance, the influence of particle size on total thermal conductivity of composite is obvious, the larger size particles tend <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>requirement</b> of the high thermal conductivity of composite.

There was an effect of phytase addition and inorganic phosphorus supplementation on bone phosphorus and whole-body phosphorus (p< 0. 05). A significant effect was also observed on phosphorus digestibility, phosphorus retention efficiency and phosphorus load of the water. Phosphorus digestibility and retention efficiency were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher, and phosphorus load of the water was significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in fish fed the phytase supplemented diet compared with diets containing supplemental inorganic phosphorus and the basal diet. In conclusion, phytase increased phosphorus availability, therefore reducing the need to add inorganic phosphorus and reducing phosphorus waste from low fish meal based diets for tilapia...|$|E
