5|$|Following the Olympics, Meissner {{returned}} to Baltimore. On the return flight, she partially ruptured {{one of her}} eardrums and fully ruptured the other. This affected her hearing as she trained for the 2006 World Championships, her first senior ISU Championship. At Worlds, Meissner placed second in her qualifying group and fifth in the short program, putting her in third place overall going into the free skate. During the free skate, Meissner completed seven triple jumps, including two triple-triple combinations, to win the title. This win made her the first woman since Kristi Yamaguchi to win a world title before a national title. Meissner is also {{the first woman to}} win Worlds on her first appearance since Oksana Baiul in 1993. She is the seventh-youngest ladies World Champion in history. Meissner has described this win as changing her career from being the underdog to being expected <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> competition she entered.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Tours are {{the three}} most prestigious multi-week stage races in {{professional}} road bicycle racing. The competitions are the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España, contested annually in that order. They are the only stage races permitted to last longer than 14 days. No cyclist has won all three Grand Tours in the same year; the only cyclists to win all three Grand Tours in their career are Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Felice Gimondi, Bernard Hinault, Alberto Contador and Vincenzo Nibali. Contador is the youngest, at 25 years, and quickest <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> Tour, completing the feat in 14 months. It is rare for cyclists to ride all Grand Tours in the same year; in 2004, for example, 474 cyclists started {{in one of the}} Grand Tours, 68 rode two and only two cyclists started all three.|$|E
5|$|An {{offensive}}ly-minded defenceman, Niedermayer {{was best}} known for his skating ability and drew comparison's to the game's offensive greats from the time he broke into the NHL. He was compared to Paul Coffey for his ability to take the puck from his own goal line and convert a defensive situation into an offensive rush. He often chafed at playing within the Devils' defence-oriented system, feeling it restricted his offensive creativity, but also admitted that he learned to place greater emphasis on his defence and develop his overall game. Niedermayer earned a reputation for inconsistency early in his career. He often played his best games against top opposition, but his failure to consistently apply his skills against all opposition occasionally frustrated his teammates and left his coaches lamenting that he was a player capable of being dominant but often was not. By {{the end of his career}} however, and following his Norris Trophy win in 2004, Niedermayer was regarded as one of the top offensive defencemen of his generation and as one of the game's greatest winners. Niedermayer and former Ducks teammate Corey Perry are the only players in hockey history <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> major contemporary North American and International Competitive titles: the Memorial Cup, World Junior championship, Stanley Cup, World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 2012, Mourinho {{signed a}} new {{four-year}} contract {{to remain as}} Real Madrid manager through to 2016. After losing 3–2 in Barcelona in {{the first leg of}} the 2012 Supercopa de España, Real Madrid won the return leg in Madrid 2–1. Real Madrid won the competition on the away goals rule after a tie of 4–4 on aggregate. This meant Mourinho had won every domestic title available for a manager in the Spanish top division within two years. He became the only coach who has won the national super cups in four different European countries. This also made Mourinho the first manager in history <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> domestic title, the league championship, cup, super cup and league cup (if available) in four European leagues.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of winning players is not <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> individual hand, {{but rather to}} make mathematically and psychologically better decisions regarding when {{and how much to}} bet, raise, call—or fold. By making such decisions to place influential bets, one can non-verbally represent or suggest holding or not-holding a certain or possible hand by either betting or not-betting pre-flop, and by venturing smaller or larger bets or raises at possibly more advantageous times, throughout the stages of the hand being dealt. One's pattern of betting may encourage opponents to bet or to fold (in this complex process, called bluffing), without verbalizing a discouraging or dishonest word. The winning poker players know how to enhance their opponents' betting and maximize their own expected gain on each round of betting, to thereby increase their long-term winnings.|$|E

25|$|By the 1980s the British African-Caribbean {{community}} was well represented at all playing {{levels of the}} game. John Barnes, born in Jamaica, {{was one of the}} most talented players of his generation and one of the few footballers <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> honour in the domestic English game including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. Although Barnes played for England on 78 occasions between 1983 and 1991, his performances rarely matched his club standard. Subsequently, Barnes identified a culture of racism in football during his era as a player. Players of African-Caribbean origin continued to excel in English football, in the 1990s Paul Ince - whose parents were from Trinidad - went on to captain Manchester United, Liverpool F.C. and the English national team. The contribution was reciprocated when a number of British born footballers including Robbie Earle, Frank Sinclair and Darryl Powell represented the Jamaica national football team in the 1998 World Cup finals.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s was {{the decade}} in which Australia began to truly {{dominate}} world rugby league. Along {{with the emergence}} of State of Origin football came a new crop of superstar players who would lead Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as Peter Sterling, Mal Meninga, Wayne Pearce, Brett Kenny, Eric Grothe and Wally Lewis came to prominence on the 1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. Australia's performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as 'the Invincibles', when they became the first team <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at Boothferry Park. The score was only 10–4 at half time, but after the break Australia's superior fitness showed and they ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.|$|E

This was the fifth time Brazil had won the World Cup, {{cementing}} their status as the most successful national team {{in the history of the}} competition. Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shootout at some stage during the knockout phase, and the total number of penalty shootouts (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> match at a World Cup Finals since 1970, and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.|$|E
25|$|While {{there was}} {{substantial}} criticism {{aimed at the}} BCS system from coaches, media, and fans alike, there was is also support for the system. Tim Cowlishaw of The Dallas Morning News cited several advantages that the BCS has over a playoff system. Under the BCS, a single defeat was extremely detrimental to a team's prospects for a national championship, although critics pointed out regularly that history shows non-AQ conference teams were hurt far more than AQ conference teams when they lost a game. Supporters contended that this created a substantial incentive for teams {{to do their best}} <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>every</b> game. Under a proposed playoffs system, front-running teams could be in a position of safety {{at the end of the}} regular season and could pull or greatly reduce their use of top players in order to protect them from injuries or give them recovery time (this happens frequently in the NFL). This may have been less likely to happen under the BCS system where a team in the running for a No. 1 or No. 2 ranking at the end of the year would likely have been punished in the polls for a loss, potentially eliminating them from contention.|$|E
