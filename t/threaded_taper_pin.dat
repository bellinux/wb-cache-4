Additional designs include the Triflute and Trivex series. The Triflute design has a complex system of three <b>tapering,</b> <b>threaded</b> re-entrant flutes that appear to increase material movement around the tool. The Trivex tools use a simpler, non-cylindrical, pin and have been found to reduce the forces acting on the tool during welding.|$|R

Two pieces of AZ 31 alloy with thickness of 6 mm were friction stir welded by using conventional milling machine. The shoulder diameter used in this experiment is fixed at 18 mm. The <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio used are varied at 6 : 6, 6 : 5, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 and 6 : 1. The rotational speeds that were used in this study were 500 rpm, 1000 rpm and 1500 rpm, respectively. The welding speeds used are 150 mm/min, 200 mm/min and 250 mm/min. Microstructure observation of welded area was studied by using optical microscope. Equiaxed grains were observed at the TMAZ and stir zone indicating fully plastic deformation. Tool pin diameter ratio 6 / 1 causes low heat input to the material because of small contact surface between tool surface and stirred materials compared to other tool pin diameter ratio. The grain size of stir zone increased with increasing of ratio of rotational speed to transverse speed due to higher heat input. It is observed that, worm hole is produced when excessive heat input is applied. To evaluate the mechanical properties of this specimen, tensile test was used in this study. Welded specimens using <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio 6 : 1 shows higher tensile strength compared to other <b>taper</b> <b>pin</b> ratio up to 204 MPa.
