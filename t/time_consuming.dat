5000|$|The {{documentary}} film Rerberg and Tarkovsky: The Reverse Side of [...] "Stalker" [...] by Igor Mayboroda offers a different {{interpretation of the}} relationship between Rerberg and Tarkovsky. Rerberg felt that Tarkovsky was not ready for this script. He told Tarkovsky to rewrite the script in order to achieve a good result. Tarkovsky ignored him and continued shooting. After several arguments, Tarkovsky sent Rerberg home. Ultimately, Tarkovsky shot Stalker three <b>times,</b> <b>consuming</b> over 5,000 meters of film. People who have seen both the first version shot by Rerberg (as Director of Photography) and the final theatrical release say that they are almost identical. Tarkovsky sent home other crew members in addition to Rerberg and excluded them from the credits as well.|$|R

5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely <b>time</b> <b>consuming.</b> The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E

It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcquiring labeled {{data for}} the {{training}} a classifier is very difficult, <b>times</b> <b>consuming</b> and expensive {{in the area of}} remote sensing. Many semi-supervised techniques have been developed and explored for the classification of remote sensing images with limited number of labeled samples. Self-learning is a semi-supervised technique in which a classifier is trained in iterative manner. Recently a clustering technique has been integrated in self-learning framework to improve the performance of semi-supervised classifications. This technique considers only the most confident samples to train a classifier. It is possible that most confident samples may not able to improve discriminative capability of the classifier. In this paper, an approach is proposed to select confident as well as informative samples. The experimental results with probabilistic support vector machine and semi-supervised fuzzy c-means on two publically available remote sensing images show that the proposed technique is effective and efficient...|$|R
5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, <b>time</b> <b>consuming,</b> and costly.|$|E
5|$|Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices {{is usually}} done by augmentative {{communication}} specialists. Specialists {{are required to}} cater {{to the needs of}} the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ phrases they want. For example, patients use different phrases based on their age, disability, interests, etc. Therefore, content organization is extremely <b>time</b> <b>consuming.</b> Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children’s Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations to keep these program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of sound films before dubbing and subtitling, one way to present a film to a foreign {{audience}} was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> and expensive procedure, most filmmakers who did this tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer Seymour Nebenzal felt that creating this alternative version would enhance international sales for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. The French-language screenplay was adapted by René Sti. Lang was fluent in French and directed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in both French and German. Actor Karl Meixner played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the French version with his lines being dubbed. The French version, titled Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse, was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production.|$|E
5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous <b>time</b> <b>consuming</b> steps. The {{most basic}} {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E

In 1958 Botha was appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs by Hendrik Verwoerd, and in 1961 advanced to Minister of Coloured Affairs. He was appointed Minister for Defence by Verwoerd's successor B.J. Vorster, upon Verwoerd's murder, in 1966. Under his 14 years as its leader, the South African Defence Force reached a zenith, at <b>times</b> <b>consuming</b> 20% of the national budget, compared to 1.3% in 1968, and was involved in the South African Border War.
