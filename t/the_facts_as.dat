5|$|Soon {{after the}} dress code dust-up made headlines, a letter was sent to The New York Times by the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), by its {{president}} Belinda Bearden, disputing <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>as</b> reported. According to the WPBA, {{the dress code}} was self-imposed by the players {{in an attempt to}} improve the image of women's pool and to attract more spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8–7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.|$|E

25|$|With Goodson-Todman {{established}} as a reliable producer of high-rated games for CBS, including What's My Line?, To Tell the Truth, and I've Got a Secret, the network confidently gave the new word association game the 2:00 PM (1:00 Central) time slot, replacing the courtroom-themed game Face <b>the</b> <b>Facts.</b> <b>As</b> television's first successful celebrity-civilian team game, Password attracted a large and loyal audience that made it into a solid Nielsen favorite for nearly five years as shows came and went with great frequency on the other networks. A concurrent prime time version which debuted in January 1962 was also successful, albeit somewhat less than the daytime show; despite this, both versions performed strongly in the ratings and looked to run well past the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Topon {{has stated}} {{numerous}} {{times that the}} name Fuck the Facts was chosen, in part, as a statement about his attitude towards the music he wrote. He tried not to feel hampered by genre labels, and that {{is reflected in the}} musical style. The earlier Fuck the Facts recordings up until approximately 2000 featured a combination of grindcore and noise. Though those two genres were prominent during this era of recording, many other styles crept into the music as well including death metal, electronic and even as some as diverse as disco and jazz. When Discoing the Dead was released in early 2001, it retained many of these experimental styles, paving the way for the beginning of the first incarnation of Fuck <b>the</b> <b>Facts</b> <b>as</b> a full band.|$|E

25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} is {{significant}} that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). They point to the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from the peril facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>as</b> known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E
25|$|General Edmund Hogan {{was also}} a veteran of several heated {{political}} campaigns for seats in the council of the Territorial Legislature. Hogan represented Arkansas in the Territorial General Assembly of Missouri in 1816 and 1818, when Arkansas {{was part of the}} Missouri Territory. In the election of 1827, there were three candidates, Colonel Walker, General Hogan and Judge Scott. The election was apparently very heated. After the election was over, tensions appeared to calm and everything appeared quiet. On May 31, 1828 a public hanging occurred in Little Rock, which drew spectators from far and near. When the hanging was over Judge Scott {{made his way to the}} store of McLane & Badgett on the west side of Main street. He was discussing the circumstances of the hanging, when General Hogan entered the store. General Hogan was a man weighing nearly three hundred pounds, and stood over six feet tall. Judge Scott was a small man, not weighing more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The conversation went on, with both Scott and Hogan taking part, neither showing any animosity to the other. The conversation soon diverged from the hanging to politics, and before the men knew it they were discussing the old Walker and Hogan political race. This seemed to revive in the mind of General Hogan something that occurred in the triangular race between himself, Walker and Scott. He turned to Scott and accused him of writing a letter which was derogatory to Hogan. Scott at once informed the general that he had been misinformed. Hogan reiterated the statement and said that he believed that it was true. Scott denied it again, and apparently accused Hogan of lying. Both men were standing up and as soon as Scott made the last remark, Hogan struck him, knocking him to the floor. Scott remained on the floor for a moment, apparently knocked senseless. As Scott revived, he struggled to his feet, and Hogan prepared to strike another blow. As Scott arose he unsheathed a dirk from a sword cane which he carried and plunged the dirk several times into the body of General Hogan. Hogan fell and expired within an hour. Judge Scott was arrested by his brother, United States Marshal George Scott, and taken before an officer for trial. <b>The</b> <b>facts</b> <b>as</b> stated above were there proven, and the court held Hogan to have been the aggressor and released Judge Scott.|$|E

However, since the inherent tendency test had caused confusion, it affirmed the High Court's ruling that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing the court. It felt that trying to elaborate {{on the meaning of}} a [...] "real risk" [...] was not helpful, and that the court should simply ask itself whether, [...] "having regard to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>as</b> well as surrounding context, a 'real risk' that public confidence in the administration of justice is – or would be – undermined {{as a result of the}} impugned statement?" ...|$|E

[...] He argues that existing literature available in the West is skewed in favor of China because of the demands for [...] "political correctness" [...] {{on the part of}} publishers and the vested interests of the three major categories of foreigners in China, the missionaries, businesspeople and government officials. He notes that while China's virtues will speak for themselves, [...] "in appraising a stranger with whom we are to deal, {{it is important to know}} his shortcomings".|$|E

500|$|The Rhodesian High Court granted full de jure {{recognition}} to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists {{who had been a}} month earlier convicted [...] of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council [...] "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that [...] "on <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>as</b> they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".|$|E

[...] Hood was attracted to the film because he believed [...] "the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice." [...] Calling Austen a [...] "genius" [...] and [...] "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy [...] "was absolutely essential in shaping her work." [...] Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is [...] "based on <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>as</b> they are known {{and the majority of}} characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film.
