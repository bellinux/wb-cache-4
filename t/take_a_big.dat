5|$|By {{the time}} the provincial {{election}} was called in September 2011, support for Dunderdale, her government and the Progressive Conservatives had fallen in public opinion polls. However, her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier. On October 11, 2011, Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote, which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign. After an initial bounce in the polls following the election, support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014. Throughout 2012, Dunderdale saw her personal numbers <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit, while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline. In November 2012, 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, down from 59 per cent a year earlier. Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support had fallen 14 points over the year to 46 per cent. While government satisfaction had fallen it remained high, with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied. An Angus Reid poll released in December 2012, also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year. Just 37 per cent of those polled approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier, while 55 per cent disapproved.|$|E

As Cricket Australia chief executive, Sutherland would later work alongside the Australian captain, as he did with Steve Waugh whom he also took the wicket of during his career, on his List A debut. He was part of Victoria's 1992/93 Mercantile Mutual Cup campaign and played in the Final which they lost to New South Wales.|$|E

According to the game's Metacritic page, this was an opinion held by many reviewers. Another criticism concerned the game's save feature.

2500|$|Standing [...] tall, Parsons {{played at}} full forward or centre half-forward in underage matches, but was {{considered}} a utility player early in his WAFL career. Later, however, he played almost exclusively in the forward line, both on the half-forward flank and as a key-position player. At times during the 2002 and 2003 seasons, he was considered South Fremantle's [...] "spearhead". During the 1998 season, when Parsons was aged 21, one writer in The West Australian described him as an [...] "exceptionally good reader of the ball" [...] and an [...] "excellent long right-foot kick", but criticised his pace and his defensive game. Another source noted his [...] "ability to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> mark and [...] to kick team-lifting goals". Parsons nominated several times for the AFL Draft, but was never selected. At the 1998 draft, he {{was considered a}}n [...] "outside chance" [...] to be drafted, while [...] expressed interest in selecting him at the 2002 draft, following his career-best season for South Fremantle.|$|E

2500|$|Ben Mepham, bioethicist {{and fellow}} of the Royal Society of Biology, in his review of Francione and Garner's book The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?, concludes about the vegan {{philosophy}} that [...] "if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances ‘all things considered’, it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: ‘to conclude that veganism is the ‘only ethical response’ is to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> leap into a very muddy pond’." [...] He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources {{that are used to}} promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.|$|E
