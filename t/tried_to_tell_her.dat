5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> not to kill herself. When Selena {{opened the door to}} leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
25|$|Shwetha is now distraught {{with being}} in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is {{ultimately}} happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.|$|E
60|$|He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{rather more}} plainly {{what he felt}} about the whole {{question}} of religion in their lives, but eloquence had departed from him.|$|E
6000|$|He was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he {{was utterly}} unworthy of Miss Walshingham, when Chitterlow gave up the search and {{suddenly}} {{accused him of being}} drunk and talking [...] "Rot----." ...|$|R
50|$|Angel pulls Nina {{through her}} bedroom window and Wesley tranquilizes her. The next day, Nina wakes up naked in a cell. Angel <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that she is safe, and shows her a video {{of herself as a}} wolf in the cell the night before. She is upset with her {{condition}} {{and the fact that she}} wanted to hurt Amanda. He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that it was the monster inside her that caused the violent impulses, and <b>tells</b> <b>her</b> that she can control herself - he does it every day. Nina asks if he can cure her and Angel admits that he can not, but says he can protect her. Angel meets with Fred and Royce, telling them Nina agreed to stay in the holding cell that night. Royce warns that Nina might hurt herself, but she might be okay if they take her back to her place; the familiarity will calm her. Angel agrees to let Nina go home; Fred and Nina head to Nina's place. Fred <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that her life does not have to change too much, since she is only a werewolf three nights out of the month.|$|R
50|$|A fortune-teller, she {{can read}} minds from both humans and Pokémon with her magic ball. Arbok <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> he's {{in love with}} Jigglypuff's sister, Wigglytuff. She {{had nothing to do}} with making Arbok fall in love with Wigglytuff.|$|R
60|$|I {{attempted}} to reassure her. I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what {{was indeed the}} truth--that I had only been thinking of the ordinary chances and changes of life, when I spoke.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Linley <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to go on. The {{words were}} in her mind; but the {{capacity}} of giving expression to them failed her. She impatiently made a sign. The sign was understood.|$|E
60|$|He did not reply. So {{often she}} did not take his meaning, but left him alone with his sense of tragedy. She {{had no idea how}} his life was {{wrenched}} from its roots, and when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> she balked him, leaving him inwardly quite lonely.|$|E
50|$|Bree tells Carolyn that Harvey {{has been}} {{cheating}} on her. She rings Harvey at the supermarket, {{and tells him}} she knows about Monique. He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that Monique is dead. Carolyn then goes to a drawer {{and takes out a}} gun. Harvey calls Susan about what happened.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Yağmur flirts {{online with}} an unknown boy who {{turns out to}} be Cem's best friend Costa. Costa falls in love with the unaware Yağmur and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he is the one she has been chatting with, but his {{stuttering}} holds him back every time.|$|R
5000|$|... "Moon Crying" [...] {{carried a}} very somber tone about missing a {{deceased}} loved one {{and not knowing}} how to move on. In the video, Kumi's departed lover comes to her as a spirit, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> it's okay <b>to</b> move on. She becomes angry, but ultimately accepts his death.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{has engaged}} herself to Felix. She is desperately {{in love with}} him,-- as is he with her.' She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> story truly, knowing that no advice can be worth {{anything}} that {{is not based on}} a true story;--but lying had become her nature. 'Melmotte naturally wants her to marry the lord. He came here to tell me that if his daughter married Felix she would not have a penny.' ...|$|E
60|$|She was so true, {{she was so}} beautiful, she was so good,--I owed her so much gratitude, she was so dear to me, that I {{could find}} no {{utterance}} for what I felt. I tried to bless her, tried to thank her, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> (as I had often done in letters) what an influence she had upon me; but all my efforts were in vain. My love and joy were dumb.|$|E
60|$|Wilmet <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that she}} had not known how it was at the time, but this seemed no comfort; and it was plain that that day's solemnity had lessened the {{inequality}} between the two girls so much, that for Wilmet to console her as a child was vain; and indeed, her invalid state and constant companionship with her father had rendered her religions feeling much more excitable, and more developed, than were as yet Wilmet's; and meantime, this piteous sobbing and weeping was doing great bodily harm.|$|E
50|$|Sophie {{had hoped}} she would know her father the moment she saw him, but is now only confused. She <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> fiancé, Sky, how she feels without confessing what she has done. Sky <b>tells</b> <b>her</b> {{he will be the}} only man she ever needs ("Lay All Your Love on Me").|$|R
5000|$|In a 1975 {{episode of}} All in the Family, [...] "The Very Moving Day", Gloria, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> parents {{that she is}} pregnant, sings the song to them as a hint: ("I found a million-dollar HMM-HMM at the five and ten cent store"), to which Archie responds, [...] "You found a baby at Woolworth's?" ...|$|R
50|$|George {{meets with}} Joyce on a beach. This Joyce is a scientist, {{but she does}} not know George, and she has a boyfriend. George <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that they were once married and lived {{together}} and it freaks her out. Joyce insists that he has her mixed up with someone else and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> run from George. George then attacks Joyce.|$|R
60|$|Christina did {{not break}} out into the wailing and weeping that the old nurse expected; she was still far too much stunned and overwhelmed, and she entreated to be told all, lying still, but gazing at Ursel with piteous bewildered eyes. Ursel and Else helping one another out, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> but they were much confused; all they knew was that the party had been {{surprised}} at night in a village hostel by the Schlangenwaldern, and all slain, though the young Baron had {{lived long enough to}} charge the Schneiderlein with his commendation of his wife to his mother; but all particulars had been lost in the general confusion.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{laid down}} the lantern, and stood for a moment, undecided. He looked at Molly, and {{suddenly}} there came over him an overwhelming desire to tell her everything. He had tried to stifle his conscience, to assure himself that the old days were over, {{and that there was}} no need to refer to them. And for a while he had imposed upon himself. But lately the falseness of his position had come home to him. He could not allow her to marry him, in ignorance of what he had been. It would be a villainous thing to do. Often he had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> but had failed. He saw that it must be done, here and now.|$|E
60|$|Ashe {{regarded}} the intruder with a malevolent eye. Never fond of Mr. Judson, he looked on him now with positive loathing. It {{had not been}} {{easy for him to}} work himself up {{to the point where he}} could discuss with Joan the mysterious ways of Providence, for there was that about her which made it hard to achieve sentiment. That indefinable something in Joan Valentine which made for nocturnal raids on other people's museums also rendered her a somewhat difficult person to talk to about twin souls and destiny. The qualities that Ashe loved in her--her strength, her capability, her valiant self-sufficingness--were the very qualities which seemed to check him when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he loved them.|$|E
50|$|Because {{he was the}} 6 billionth to die and depart to Polaris, Onion {{is granted}} a wish. He wishes to return to Earth. But there's a limit of five days. Unfortunately the rules {{stipulate}} that he cannot tell anyone who he really is and that, at the same time, he will be not be recognized as Onion himself by his former friends. Upon returning <b>to</b> Earth, Onion <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> talk to Autumn, who is upset over his death. He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> who he really is but can't without breaking the rules, and finds her being wooed by Dr. Woo. He wastes a few days <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> but finally gives up and makes {{the most of the}} time he has with her. At the end of Onion's stay, Autumn slowly realizes that he is Onion. But by that time, there are only few minutes left until the meteor showers, flying him back to Polaris.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{goes to the}} fundraiser {{to explain}} and he {{makes it clear that}} he wants to be with Faye. Eva sees them {{together}} and she goes back home. When Lee is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he can't be with her, it is revealed that somehow Eva has magic powers. Her anger leads her to use those powers to kill Lee.|$|R
50|$|One night, {{she has a}} {{dream that}} Solomon Braithwaite has risen from the grave and is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something. The {{following}} day, she gets {{a phone call from}} Helen Addams, Solomon's ex-wife. She too had the dream and wanted to know what its meaning was. Suzanne visits her that night, and while there, they are attacked by the White Worm, Silbakor's antithesis.|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} her, puzzled, yet piqued {{and excited}} by her manner, as with rapid steps she hurried along the pavement. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what her friendship meant to him; they were, he declared, kindred spirits--from {{the first time}} he had seen her, on the Common, he had known this. She scarcely heard him, she was thinking of Ditmar; and this was why she had led Rolfe into Warren Street they might meet Ditmar! It was possible that he would be going to the mill at this time, after his dinner! She scrutinized every distant figure, and when they reached the block in which he lived she walked more slowly. From within the house came to her, faintly, the notes of a piano--his daughter Amy was practising. It was the music, a hackneyed theme of Schubert's played heavily, that seemed to arouse the composite emotion of anger and hatred, yet of sustained attraction and wild regret she had felt before, but never so poignantly as now. And she lingered, perversely resolved to steep herself in the agony.|$|E
6000|$|And now, I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> of the {{struggle}} I had had, and the conclusion I had come to. I tried to lay my mind before her, truly, and entirely. I tried to show her how I had hoped I {{had come into the}} better knowledge of myself and of her; how I had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought; and how I had come there, even that day, in my fidelity to this. If she did so love me (I said) that she could take me for her husband, she could do so, on no deserving of mine, except upon the truth of my love for her, and the trouble in which it had ripened to be what it was; and hence it was that I revealed it. And O, Agnes, even out of thy true eyes, in that same time, the spirit of my child-wife looked upon me, saying it was well; and winning me, through thee, to tenderest recollections of the Blossom that had withered in its bloom! ...|$|E
6000|$|Some hours, as I suppose, {{must have}} passed, and I was still absorbed {{in my own}} melancholy thoughts, when I {{suddenly}} became conscious {{of a new and}} strange sensation which astonished and alarmed me. I started up in the bed, breathless and bewildered. The movement awakened Mrs. Macallan. [...] "Are you ill?" [...] she asked. [...] "What is the matter with you?" [...] I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> as well as I could. She seemed to understand me before I had done; she took me tenderly in her arms, and pressed me to her bosom. [...] "My poor innocent child," [...] she said, [...] "is it possible you don't know? Must I really tell you?" [...] She whispered her next words. Shall I ever forget the tumult of feelings which the whisper aroused in me--the strange medley of joy and fear, and wonder and relief, and pride and humility, which filled my whole being, and made a new woman of me from that moment? Now, for the first time, I knew it! If God spared me for a few months more, the most enduring and the most sacred of all human joys might be mine--the joy of being a mother.|$|E
50|$|John is in {{the kitchen}} when Elena shows up. John <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how he met Isobel and how turning her into a vampire changed her {{completely}} when Elena grabs a knife and cuts off his fingers, severing him from his ring. John realizes {{that this is not}} Elena but Katherine but it is too late to do anything and Katherine stabs him in the stomach.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} episode, Sally's grandma informs her she {{must return to}} the Magic Kingdom. Before leaving, Sally <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> friends about her origins, but no one will believe her. Then her {{elementary}} school catches on fire, and Sally uses her magic to put it out. Her powers thus exposed, Sally's time to leave has finally come. She waves farewell to her friends, {{and returns to the}} Magic Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The first battle {{comes to}} a halt, though, when she slips on a {{cannonball}} and crashes into the clock, losing consciousness {{for the rest of}} the night. The next morning, she awakens in her own bed and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> mother about the battle, only to be told to rest. Drosselmeier visits with the repaired but now lifeless Nutcracker, giving only vague answers to Clara's questions about the previous night.|$|R
60|$|He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> of Cambridge and {{his friends}} and the {{undergraduate}} life he was leading, but he found it difficult. All {{sorts of things that}} seemed right and good at Trinity seemed out of drawing in the peculiar atmosphere she created about her. All sorts of clumsiness and youthfulness in himself and his associates he felt she wouldn't accept, couldn't accept, that it would be wrong of her to accept. Before they could come before her they must wear a bravery. He couldn't, for instance, tell her how Billy Prothero, renouncing vanity and all social pretension, had worn a straw hat into November and the last stages of decay, and how it had been burnt by a special commission ceremonially in the great court. He couldn't convey to her the long sessions of beer and tobacco and high thinking that went on in Prothero's rooms into the small hours. A certain Gothic greyness and flatness and muddiness through which the Cambridge spirit struggles to its destiny, he concealed from her. What remained to tell was--attenuated. He could not romance. So she tried to fill in his jejune outlines. She tried to inspire a son who seemed most unaccountably up to nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course in}} my own mind now it is very clear. I had a kind of illumination...." [...] He would have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> of his vision, and he was too shy. [...] "It came to me {{suddenly}} that the whole world was in confusion because men followed after a thousand different immediate aims, when really it was quite easy, if only one could be simple it was quite easy, to show that nearly all men could only be fully satisfied and made happy in themselves by one single aim, which was also the aim that would make the whole world one great order, and that aim was to make God King of one's heart and the whole world. I saw that all this world, except for a few base monstrous spirits, was suffering hideous things because of this war, and before the war it was full of folly, waste, social injustice and suspicion for the same reason, because it had not realized the kingship of God. And that is so simple; the essence of God is simplicity. The sin of this war lies with men like myself, men who set up to tell people about God, more than it lies with any other class--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was shown}} {{up to her}} own little sitting-room. She had already gone up to her room to dress, but when she heard that he had called, and wanted very greatly to see her, she slipped on a loose, {{beautiful}} tea-gown négligé thing, and hurried to him. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> everything, but she only kept saying [...] "There! there!" [...] She was sure he wanted a cup of tea, he looked so pale and exhausted. She rang to have the tea equipage brought back; she put the dear saint in an arm-chair by the fire; she put cushions about him, and ministered to him. And when she began partially to comprehend what he had experienced, she suddenly realized that she too had experienced it. That vision had been a brain-wave between their two linked and sympathetic brains. And that thought glowed in her as she brewed his tea with her own hands. He had been weeping! How tenderly he felt all these things! He was more sensitive than a woman. What madness to have expected understanding from the Bishop! But that was just like his unworldliness. He was not fit {{to take care of}} himself. A wave of tenderness carried her away. [...] "Here is your tea!" [...] she said, bending over him, and fully conscious of her fragrant warmth and sweetness, and suddenly, she could never afterwards explain why she was so, she was moved to kiss him on his brow....|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Andromeda {{begins to}} receive myriad {{messages}} from Daisy, beyond the grave, and plies Daisy's younger brother with naked girl magazines (or [...] "bagel worm agonies" [...] as she mishears {{thanks to her}} partial deafness) {{in exchange for the}} remaining scraps of her dead best-friend's belongings. She then uses these as part of her witchcraft in an attempt to figure out just what Daisy is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{turns and}} sees his friend, who has finally become {{reconciled}} to him, having decided to visit the altar to honour not her own Dead but Stransom's. Stransom, dying, <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that {{he is ready to}} add a candle for Hague, but is able only to say [...] "One more, just one more". The story ends with his face showing [...] "the whiteness of death." [...] Thus Stransom's last words are rendered ambiguous.|$|R
50|$|At lunch, Taminella {{announces that}} she and Rupert have decided Taminella shall be crowned queen, as Melora cannot be understood. Melora frantically <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> father the truth about Taminella, {{but he does not}} {{understand}} her mixed-up speech. Robin also <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the king the truth, but Taminella silences him by stuffing his mouth with popovers. Unable to get through to her father, Melora storms out, leaving Robin behind. Taminella takes Robin to Sweetums's lair in a cage.|$|R
