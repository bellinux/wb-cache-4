Varying mixes of red and yellow bricks, and variations in window design and ornamental motifs, were used <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> street a distinct identity. All were designed with front and back gardens. Corner houses were given distinctive designs and turrets.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.|$|E

5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> world a theme, {{they were}} each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E
5|$|Under manager George Scherger, the Sounds {{started the}} 1979 season poorly, before {{rallying}} to win 20 of 31games in late May and June. They entered {{the last day}} of the first half of the season in first place, but lost their game to cross-state rivals the Memphis Chicks and finished in second place. The Sounds and Chicks met again on {{the last day of}} the second half in a split doubleheader; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series, two games to one, before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville captured their first Southern League championship by defeating the Astros, three games to one. Schmittou wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> player a $1,000 bonus for winning the pennant, but as that would have been against the National Association's rules, he settled for buying them championship rings instead. Geoff Combe, with a league-leading 27saves, won the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. The Sounds compiled an 83–61 record that season. During the All-Star Break between the halves of the season, Nashville played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's All-Stars against the major league Atlanta Braves. The All-Stars defeated the Braves, five to two. Nashville's Duane Walker was named the game's MVP.|$|E

25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks.

After a first date, {{it is common for}} the couple <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> other a quick kiss on the cheek (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.|$|E
25|$|The main {{activity}} in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking {{the role of}} counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person {{in the role of}} counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.|$|E
25|$|In February 1943, due {{to their}} {{inadequate}} capabilities against higher-altitude aircraft, the divisions were reorganized to strengthen their weaponry. This involved splitting one of the division's light regiments and transferring its batteries to the remaining regiments <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> of the remaining regiments four batteries totalling sixteen guns each. To replace the fourth regiment, the divisions were given a heavy AA regiment with four batteries with four 85mm guns each. Simultaneously, the Maxim batteries of the light regiments were disbanded and their personnel used to strengthen the DShK-armed companies, doubling the number of platoons, and maintenance units joined the divisions. These changes increased {{the strength of the}} divisions to 1,973 men with the addition of 20 more DShKs and sixteen 85mm guns.|$|E

25|$|Crosswalks (or {{pedestrian}} crossings) {{are common}} in populated areas, and may indicate that pedestrians have priority over vehicular traffic. In most modern cities, the traffic signal is used to establish {{the right of way}} on the busy roads. Its primary purpose is <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>each</b> road a duration of time in which its traffic may use the intersection in an organized way. The intervals of time assigned for each road may be adjusted to take into account factors such as difference in volume of traffic, the needs of pedestrians, or other traffic signals. Pedestrian crossings may be located near other traffic control devices; if they are not also regulated in some way, vehicles must give priority to them when in use. Traffic on a public road usually has priority over other traffic such as traffic emerging from private access; rail crossings and drawbridges are typical exceptions.|$|E
