5|$|Heavy rains caused {{landslides}} {{and flash}} flooding that {{was responsible for}} extensive crop and property damage across Japan. The typhoon contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> flooding in Hokkaido in ten years. Overall, 33people were killed and 51others were injured, including 36seriously. Fifty-six trains and seventy-five flights were cancelled; ferry services were also disrupted by the storm. Greater than 100landslides occurred while over 40bridges were inundated. A total of 48,832houses sustained flooded and 3,000dwellings were damaged. Moreover, 177houses were destroyed, resulting in almost 2,800homeless families. Twenty-eight ships, as well as 80,033ha (197,770acres) of farmland, suffered damage. Nationwide, the typhoon inflicted 34billion yen ($114million USD) worth of damage.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{was left}} with a weak side of young and inexperienced players which would stumble to a franchise-worst record of only 3 wins against 10 losses during the 2008 Super 14 season, and {{finished}} as the lowest-placed New Zealand team on the table. Jimmy Cowan, one of the team's few bright spots through this period, was appointed team captain for 2009, but things would improve little over the following two seasons as the team again limped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record of the New Zealand clubs. When Moore was released as coach following the 2010 season, the franchise had compiled a record of only 10 wins against 29 losses in three seasons under his leadership.|$|E

Seven states sent tree trimmers to help clear debris from power lines and roads to speed the recovery process. In addition, FEMA gave SLEMCO, the state's power company, an $8.6million grant, which paid for 75% of {{the damage to the}} electrical grid there. It took up to four weeks to restore power to all customers.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Kim contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> monsoon rains in Thailand in 30 years. Sixteen of Thailand's 73provinces were {{inundated}} {{due to the}} storm. In {{the capital}} of Bangkok, almost every street and alley sustained flooding, stranding motorists. Throughout the country, a total of 190 bridges and at least 1,000roads were damaged. The tropical storm also destroyed 300boats, 3,000houses, and 19,750acres (8,000ha) of rice. Damage from both Kim and Tropical Storm Herbert, which affected the same areas as Kim a few weeks earlier, totaled $26 million (1983USD). Due to Kim alone, over 200people died in Thailand, and an additional 100were killed due to widespread flooding in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|West {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was crew chief in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify {{the best and worst}} umpires. West was identified as the best MLB umpire by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> umpire, 6 percent of players in the survey selected West. Only three umpires were named more frequently as worst umpire in the survey. A 2007 review of umpire strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West was the most consistent umpire in the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|In Bergkamp's {{second season}} at Inter, the club changed {{managers}} again, appointing Ottavio Bianchi. Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign, troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup. He managed to score 5 goals in 26 appearances. Off the field, Bergkamp's {{relationship with the}} Italian press and fans became uncomfortable. His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy. Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> performance of the week, L'asino della settimana (Donkey of the Week) to Bergkamp della settimana. Inter ended the league season in sixth position and failed to retain the UEFA Cup, with the club eliminated in the second round. In February 1995, the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan Massimo Moratti, who promised to invest heavily in the squad. Bergkamp's future in the first team was uncertain following the signing of Maurizio Ganz {{a month after the}} takeover.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, an {{efficient}} linear time algorithm TACO is proposed for <b>the</b> first time <b>to</b> minimize <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> case clock skew {{in the presence}} of on-chip thermal variation. TACO, while tries <b>to</b> minimize <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> case clock skew, also attempts <b>to</b> minimize <b>the</b> clock tree wirelength by building up merging diamonds in a bottom-up manner. As an output, TACO provides balanced merging points and the modified clock routing paths <b>to</b> minimize <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> case clock skew under thermal variation. Experimental results on a set of standard benchmarks show 50 - 70 % skew reduction with less than 0. 6 % wirelength overhead. I...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to requesting international aid, the Yemen government declared Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates as disaster areas, after then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh surveyed the affected areas. The president also utilized the nation's military to assist storm victims, and sent aircraft with tents, food, and medicine <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> hit areas. To {{raise money for}} the disaster recovery, the Yemeni government cut one day of salary for all workers, equating to $4.25million, and the government provided another $100million from its annual budget. Local charities and residents collectively raised $8.5million. Yemen's Red Cross provided meals and water to about 21,000people. The agency also provided school kits for 4,500students whose facilities were damaged. Ultimately, the Red Cross assisted over 70,000storm victims through health programs, and also helped residents cope with stress, hygiene promotion, and other ongoing vulnerabilities to their livelihoods.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Eline struck Madagascar, the {{government}} began distributing relief items, such as rice, tents, and sheets. On February 21, survey flights helped indicate the extent of damage across the nation. Supplies were distributed by road from Antananarivo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> affected areas, with helicopters dropping off aid to isolated communities. After receiving request from the Malagasy government, UNICEF flew 15 tons of supplies from Copenhagen, such as medicine, 10.5 tons of food, and equipment to help coordinate relief work. The agency also transported thousands of blankets and water purification tablets from Antananarivo. However, UNICEF faced difficulties in distributing the supplies. The government of France sent two helicopters with teams of doctors to Madagascar, and Médecins Sans Frontières sent about 35 tons of supplies, such as medicine, water purifying devices, and food. The World Food Programme flew about 400 tons of food to affected residents across the country, including 25 tons to Mahanoro. Due to the combined impacts of Eline and Gloria, {{the government}} of Madagascar requested for international assistance on March 7, which was coordinated through the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In response, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom donated £1.3 million ($1.9 million USD) to Madagascar. The Organisation of African Unity donated $200,000 to Madagascar on March 10. In addition to Cyclone Gloria striking the country in March, Cyclone Hudah hit eastern Madagascar in early April, causing additional deaths and damage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{captain of}} the France {{national}} team was Fernand Canelle, who captained the national team in its first international match against Belgium on 1 May 1904. Canelle went on to captain France only once more in a 7–0 defeat to Belgium in 1905. The team's next captain was Pierre Allemane, who had previously captained a team representing France at the 1900 Summer Olympics. However, this occurred when the team was {{under the supervision of}} the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA), a federation sports union that supported amateur sport. Under the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) governing body, Allemane is the only French player to wear the armband in all of his national team appearances. Aside from Canelle and Allemane, Gaston Barreau, René Bonnet, Étienne Jourde, and Robert Lemaître are the only other players to ever captain the national team on their debuts. Bonnet's captaincy is notable due in part to the fact that it was his only appearance with the national team. The first player to captain France in a major international competition while playing under FIFA was André François. He led the team at the football tournament in the 1908 Summer Olympics and captained France <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> loss in national team and competition history, a 17–1 loss to Denmark. One of the first permanent captains of the national team was Jean Ducret. He captained the team 13 times between 1910–1914.|$|E
