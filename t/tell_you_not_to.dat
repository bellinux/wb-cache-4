6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} here?" [...] said the rector, a little irritably. [...] "Didn't I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come in again till I rang for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But as you cannot, you {{had better}} try to {{brighten}} up your energies. Come, you know I cannot <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> look back, but I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> look forward. Nay, I do tell you literally, to look forward, out of the window, instead of back into this hot room. Do not you think the plane-tree there looks very inviting? Suppose we transport Emily's drapery there, and I want to refresh my memory with Spenser; I do not think I have touched him since plane-tree time last year.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish,' said Claire, fretfully, {{leading the}} way down the grillroom stairs, 'that you wouldn't let all London sponge on you like this. I keep <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to.</b> I should have thought that if any one needed to keep what little money he has got it was you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, if---if {{you take}} pains,' said Mysie; 'but you mustn't bother her with {{questions}} {{in the middle of}} a lesson, or she <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> chatter. She likes to have them all kept for the end; and then, if they aren't foolish, she will take lots of trouble.' ...|$|R
50|$|You {{receive a}} letter from your brother, a scientist, who invites you to his home {{so that he can}} show you the results of his project, and you can get some ideas for your next book. However, once you arrive you find that your brother has mysteriously vanished, leaving all his {{material}} possessions to you - including a large, strange machine and a message <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reproduce his experiments.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{called to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go any further, Mr. Trumbull; and I beg of {{you not to}} mention what has been said on the subject. Will you oblige me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have not}} look'd upon you nigh, [...] Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep. [...] Great Nature is more wise than I: [...] I will not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> weep.|$|E
5000|$|Harry's {{distinctive}} squint {{was invented}} by French Stewart as he auditioned for the role. The look soon became Harry's signature. [...] "It's sort of the equivalent of your mother <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make faces because they might stick that way forever. Well, I've now got a face that's stuck," [...] said Stewart in an interview. [...] "But it's worth it. People respond to Harry, and the squint is probably {{a big part of}} his appeal. So, I'm just riding it for all it's worth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say sooth," [...] said Johnston, {{turning his}} seamed and grizzled face upon the man-at-arms. [...] "See yonder," [...] he added, {{pointing}} to a bombard which lay within the camp: [...] "there is what hath done scath to good bowmanship, with its filthy soot and foolish roaring mouth. I wonder that a true knight, like our prince, should carry such a scurvy thing in his train. Robin, thou red-headed lurden, how oft must I <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> shoot straight with a quarter-wind blowing across the mark?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then. I {{know what}} that means. When a doctor <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk, it's because he knows he can't do you any good. As soon as George Maynard gets here I will have some one that can cure me, or I will know the reason why." [...] The {{conception}} of her husband as a champion seemed to commend him to her in novel degree. She shed some tears, and after a little reflection she asked, [...] "How soon will he be here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a nice cove, too, John Cummings," [...] said Harrison, reproachfully. [...] "Didn't I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let a {{drop pass}} your lips until you had given your message to Sir Charles?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{go on that}} way,' said Harold, crying bitterly. 'Say your prayers, {{and maybe}} you will get well; {{and then in the}} morning I'll ask Mr. Cope to come down, and he'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, old man, time's up," [...] {{interrupted}} Gashford, roughly; [...] "we must be off. Now, march, {{my young}} slippery-heels. I needn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> try to bolt again. You'll {{find it difficult}} to do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're to remimber your oath, Muster Flory. You're {{become one}} of us, as Father Brosnan was <b>telling</b> <b>you.</b> You're <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be one of us, and then go over among them schaming Prothestants." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter what I have done. There are reasons, which made me wish to avoid your {{immediate}} coming. At the present moment it would interfere gravely with his happiness and with mine were he to learn the circumstances of Sir Francis Geraldine's courtship. Of course it is painful to me {{to have to say}} this to you. It is so painful that to avoid it I have absolutely written <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come. This I have done <b>not</b> <b>to</b> avoid your coming, which would otherwise have been a pleasure to me, but to save myself from this great pain. Now you know it all, and know also what it is that I expect from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> Fanny me, for I'll not {{submit to}} it! I never knew such a thing. The {{way in which}} you are {{resolved}} and determined to disgrace us on all occasions, is really infamous. You bad little thing!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] ejaculated Buck, [...] "didn't I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> trouble Roarin' Bull--that he and {{his boys}} could lick you {{if you had been}} twenty instead of ten. But how came ye to hear o' this cock-and-bull story about the Redskins?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hetty. [...] "You {{may have}} fancied so, but I hadn't. I {{was the only}} {{chaperon}} Barbara had, you see. I hope she didn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lavish the dollar on whisky. No doubt you spent it wisely on tobacco." ...|$|E

6000|$|Qu. Thou hast {{told me all}} thy story, and I {{think it}} might be more cruelty <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> than <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> thee; for I {{understand}} she is resolved <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see <b>thee,</b> and declares she is not thy mother. Will'st thou be owned where thou hast no relation? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] said Allan, simply, [...] "when I thought I {{was sweet}} on her myself. Come! come! it's a little hard, I think, {{even if you}} are in love with her, to believe {{everything}} she <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let me say a word. Is that the way you decide between us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you go {{on doing}} what they <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] said the old woman, [...] "they'll dismiss you." [...] Crocker had simply smiled ineffably. Not Æolus himself would dismiss him for a loyal {{adherence}} to the constitutional usages of European Courts.|$|E
6000|$|Gallwey {{ventured to}} expostulate with him. [...] "I believe I heard Mrs. Leland <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come; {{and if you}} are going to start again at four o'clock to-morrow, one would fancy you had done about enough," [...] he said. [...] "I'm quite sure I have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come?" [...] said I, in {{a mighty}} passion. [...] "What would {{the world have}} said?" [...] cries my Lady Muggins: [...] "my {{carriage}} is gone for Sir Alured to the Club; let me stay only ten minutes, dearest Lady Clapperclaw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't mean kill him, exactly; but do something. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what--train him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> follow <b>you</b> to {{the barn}} when he sees you going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"He {{will not}} be afraid of any evil tidings, for his heart standeth fast and believeth in the Lord,"' {{answered}} Mr. Audley. 'I see that does <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be afraid; but I imagine that a few trusting ejaculations in the heart, and then resolute attention to something else, may be found a help.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} I'm <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> we're <b>not</b> likely <b>to</b> turn <b>you</b> out {{until you have}} some {{strength}} in you. I believe I'm speaking for Miss Waynefleet now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{knew it had}} {{something}} to do with cookin'-things," [...] answered the cowboy. [...] "Mr. Endicott told me to be careful and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> shoot everything there was in the mountains, as he wanted to come out later for a shot or two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, my dear. I {{know that}} you are {{infatuated}} about these people, and that you are always inclined to contradict what I say to you; but, remember, I expect that you will obey me when I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go to Dr Thorne's house any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{go down to}} Mr. Carey's {{with your}} brother, if you please, Hal," [...] said Miss Fosbrook decidedly. [...] "If he should <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> stay, I can't help it; but you will none of you do any good by hanging about without doing your daily duties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Loudon bids me add," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer, consulting a little sheet of notes, [...] "that although these volumes are very valuable to the practical builder, {{you must be}} careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose originality. He <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> also <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be 'hadden doun'--his own expression--by the theory of strains, and that Portland cement, properly sanded, {{will go a long}} way." ...|$|R
60|$|Even what we {{have seen}} to-day[16] is more than appears to have been noticed by the most careful {{painters}} of the great schools; and you will continually fancy that I am inconsistent with myself in pressing you to learn, better than they, the anatomy of birds, while I violently and constantly urge you to refuse the knowledge of the anatomy of men. But you will find, as my system develops itself, that it is absolutely consistent throughout. I don't mean, by <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> study human anatomy, that <b>you</b> are <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know how many fingers and toes you have, nor how you can grasp and walk with them; and, similarly, when you look at a bird, I wish you to know how many claws and wing-feathers it has, and how it grips and flies with them. Of the bones, in either, I shall show you little; and of the muscles, nothing but what {{can be seen in the}} living creature, nor, often, even so much.|$|R
