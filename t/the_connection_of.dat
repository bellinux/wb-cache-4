5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>of</b> this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E

The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness.

Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. River traffic is very important for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|E

These were used in a revised version on the Sinclair QL, whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum's.

5|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} lay near Manhattan, Kansas, a town {{just off}} <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>of</b> the Kansas River and the Big Blue River. Nearby is the anticline Nemaha Ridge, {{which has been}} associated with at least a few earthquakes of Kansas. A 300‑million-year-old Precambrian granite range bounded by faults, it hosts the Humboldt Fault Zone, which, in addition to serving as the range's easternmost boundary, has produced {{a large portion of the}} state's earthquakes. Each year, it is responsible for at least several small tremors less than magnitude 2.7. It cuts through Permian rock, and according to the Geological Society of America, may actually be a complex fault. Previously, it was believed to be a simple, Precambrian structure.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train to}} use the new line was pulled by the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00am, and arrived in Bolton 26minutes 30seconds later. The second train was pulled by the Fairfield. The trains {{originally}} ran on the right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand running with <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>of</b> the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{five men}} {{were charged with}} {{terrorism}} aimed at undermining authority on 29 October. The investigation was led by Gagik Jhangiryan, the Chief Military Prosecutor of Armenia, who claimed his team {{was looking for the}} masterminds of the shooting even after the trial had begun. According to Jhangiryan, the investigating team considered more than a dozen theories. By January 2000, Jhangiryan's investigators considered <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>of</b> Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting. Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested, including Aleksan Harutiunyan, the Deputy Presidential Adviser, and Harutiun Harutiunyan, the Deputy Director of the Public Television of Armenia but, by the summer of that year, they were released. Eventually, Jhangiryan failed to find evidence linking Kocharyan to the shooting.|$|E

5|$|The {{swastika}} {{was used}} as an early symbol by the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom and others. Its earliest use in Scouting was on the Thanks Badge introduced in 1911. Lord Baden-Powell's 1922 design for the Medal of Merit added a swastika to the Scout Arrowhead to symbolize good luck for the recipient. In 1934, Scouters requested a change to the design because of <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>of</b> the swastika with its more recent use by the German National Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party.
