50|$|The genus alphacoronavirus (formerly {{known as}} Coronavirus group 1 (CoV-1)) {{includes}} subgroups 1a and 1b, which are prototyped by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-NL63, {{as well as}} the newly established species alphacoronavirus 1 (including porcine <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus TGEV), respectively. The genus Betacoronavirus (formerly Betacoronavirus group 2 (Cov-2)) includes several subgroups, with the most prominent (subgroups 2a and 2b) being prototyped by the species Murine coronavirus (including mouse hepatitis virus MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, respectively. The genus alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus derive from the bat gene pool. The genus gammacoronavirus includes all avian coronaviruses identified until 2009.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Transmissible</b> <b>Gastroenteritis</b> Virus {{has been}} {{engineered}} {{as an expression}} vector. The vector was constructed by replacing the nonessential 3a and 3b ORF, which {{is driven by the}} transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) with green fluorescent protein. The resulting construct was still enteropathogenic, but with reduced growth. The infection of cells with this altered virus elicits a specific lactogenic immune response against the heterologous protein. The application of this vector is {{in the development of a}} vaccine or even gene therapy. The motivation for engineering the TGEV genome is that coronaviruses have large genomes, so they have room for insertion of foreign genes. Coronaviruses also infect the respiratory tract, and they can be used to target antigens to that area and generate some immune response.|$|E
50|$|Coronaviruses {{also cause}} {{a range of}} {{diseases}} in farm animals and domesticated pets, some {{of which can be}} serious and are a threat to the farming industry. Economically significant coronaviruses of farm animals include porcine coronavirus (<b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> coronavirus, TGE) and bovine coronavirus, which both result in diarrhea in young animals. Feline Coronavirus: two forms, Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease associated with high mortality. Similarly, {{there are two types of}} coronavirus that infect ferrets: Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), and a more lethal systemic version of the virus (like FIP in cats) known in ferrets as ferret systemic coronavirus (FSC). There are two types of canine coronavirus (CCoV), one that causes mild gastrointestinal disease and one that has been found to cause respiratory disease. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.|$|E
50|$|The loss of CMAH {{has also}} played a role in human viral history. On one side, it has made humans more {{susceptible}} to some viruses by decreasing sialic acid diversity. Viruses that bind to Neu5Ac before entering the cell will see their binding enhanced via the cluster glycoside effect, which wouldn't be seen as strongly if other sialic acids like Neu5Gc were also present. A potential example of this is the most serious form of malaria in humans, P. falciparum, which initially targets Neu5Ac on red blood cells for binding. Oppositely though, losing CMAH should protect humans against any virus that targets Neu5Gc, such as those that cause certain diarrheal diseases in livestock, E. coli K99, <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> coronavirus, and simian virus 40 (SV40). Interestingly, another form of malaria, P. reichenowii, may have been the original selecting agent against Neu5Gc. Thus only organisms negative for Neu5Gc would survive, with the outcome being humans who are completely resistant. Further support from this idea {{comes from the fact that}} P. falciparum malaria appears to have evolved in the last tens of thousands of years.|$|E
40|$|A plaquing {{system and}} plaque {{neutralization}} test in porcine thyroid cells {{were used to}} study different <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> isolates and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. Among <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus isolates, plaque size varied considerably and mixed size ranges sometimes occurred. The most recently isolated viruses produced smaller plaques than the laboratory viruses or hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. All <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus isolates reacted in the plaque neutralization test with a <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus antiserum which showed no activity against hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus.

40|$|Clinical, {{immunofluorescence}} and histopathological {{observations were}} found to be an efficient approach for the confirmation of the diagnosis of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> in feeder swine. Two cases are reported to exemplify how feeder swine exposed to points of concentration such as holding areas, sales barns and auctions can {{play an important role in}} the epizootiology of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis.</b> A third field case is reported as an example of an outbreak of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> beginning in feeder swine and then spreading to baby pigs on the farm. All baby pigs died that were born during the acute phase of the outbreak in the feeder swine. Baby pigs born shortly after the clinical signs had abated in the herd, and from sows that had been exposed orally to virulent <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus and vaccinated with a commercial <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> vaccine ten days before farrowing, survived. This was explained by a combination of a decrease in the amount of virus shed in the environment and the immunity induced in the sows. These observations of field outbreaks of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> combined with recently reported experimental studies lend strong support to the hypothesis of a reservoir for <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus in feeder pigs. This reservoir would be based principally on the transmission of the virus on a continuous basis from the feces of recently infected pigs to susceptible pigs. Clinical signs of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> in such pigs are difficult to recognize or absent and this contributes to the importance of the reservoir in the field...|$|E
40|$|Coronavirus-like {{particles}} were visualized by {{electron microscopy}} in the intestinal contents of piglets during a diarrheal outbreak on a Quebec pig farm.

40|$|Groups of two {{or three}} day old pigs were inoculated {{intravenously}} with cell culture grown <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus.

Repeated injections of virus at seven day intervals stimulated little increase in antibody titers. However, high serum antibody titers were obtained for all pigs if the time interval between injections was extended to 15 days. Sera obtained early after exposure to live <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus contained mainly IgM antibody whereas sera obtained later after exposure contained mainly IgG antibody.

40|$|Isolation of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> {{virus was}} {{attempted}} from segments of jejunum collected from piglets submitted for diagnosis of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis.</b> The virus was isolated {{more frequently in}} susceptible piglets than in pig kidney or pig thyroid cells. Practically, both cell systems were equally capable of demonstrating the virus when the tissue suspensions were sonicated. The pig thyroid cells prepared with glands collected from minimal disease pigs were preferred to the pig kidney cells for initial virus isolation because {{of their ability to}} respond to <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus with a progressive cytopathic effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to attempt to {{establish}} spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity effector activity in the intraepithelial lymphocytes of neonatal piglets by adoptive transfer of mononuclear leukocytes from an adult donor and to determine the effect of transfer on the resistance of piglets to <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Cytotoxicity was determined by a chromium release assay using PK- 15 cells persistently infected with <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus as targets. The experimental animals were inbred miniature pigs, in which a high degree of uniformity in lymphocyte defined histocompatibility complex antigens was demonstrated by the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Adoptive transfer of 8 X 10 (7) - 4 X 10 (8) adult pig leukocytes established effector activity in eight recipient piglets, and leukocytes labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate homed to the epithelium of the small intestine. When four recipients of 5 X 10 (8) adult leukocytes were challenged with <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus, the onset of diarrhea was delayed for 24 h and the diarrhea was usually milder than in four untreated control piglets.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the sensitivity of 11 porcine viruses to the antiviral effects of porcine interferon-alpha in serum from piglets which had been infected 19 h previously with <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus, and of porcine interferon-beta prepared in PK- 15 cells by induction with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, in yield reduction assays in pig kidney cells which were treated with interferon before virus challenge, and both before and after virus challenge. The most sensitive virus to both types of interferon was vesicular stomatitis. A porcine isolate of bovine herpesvirus type 1, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus and porcine enterovirus types 1 and 2 were also highly sensitive to interferon-alpha. There was little reduction in the yield of porcine parvovirus or porcine rotavirus, while swinepox, swine influenza and <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> viruses were intermediate in their sensitivity to interferon-alpha. In addition to vesicular stomatitis virus, porcine adenovirus type 3, swine influenza, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis and porcine rotavirus were highly sensitive to interferon-beta, while swinepox, bovine herpesvirus type 1, porcine parvovirus, <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> and porcine enteroviruses were less sensitive than the above viruses to interferon-beta, although all showed significant reductions in virus yield...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the effects of ambient temperatures on the induction of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> in feeder pigs 2 to 3 months old. Pigs maintained at a high temperature (30 ± 2 °C) and exposed to the virulent <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus did not show clinical signs of the disease during their maintenance at the high temperature. On the other hand, a sudden decrease in the ambient temperature, either before or after virus inoculation, induced severe disease in feeder pigs exposed to the virus. However, continuous maintenance of pigs at the low temperature (4 ± 1 °C) tended to somewhat reduce the frequency of occurrence of signs {{in proportion to the}} length of the maintenance periods at that temperature. Pigs raised at temperatures that fluctuated between 20 ± 2 and 4 ± 1 °C every 24 h developed profuse diarrhea. The duration of clinical signs was longer in pigs maintained under the fluctuating temperatures than in those at the constantly low temperature. With one exception, antibody against <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus was demonstrated in sera collected from pigs both with and without clinical signs.

40|$|Intracellular RNAs of an avirulent small-plaque (SP) <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> {{virus variant}} and the parent virulent Miller strain of <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus were compared. Northern RNA {{blotting}} {{showed that the}} Miller strain contained eight intracellular RNA species. RNAs 1, 2 (S), 5, 6 (M), 7 (N), and 8 were similar in size for both viruses; however, the SP variant lacked subgenomic RNAs 3 and 4. Instead, the SP virus contained an altered RNA species (delta 4) that was slightly smaller than RNA 4. S 1 nuclease protection experiments showed a deletion of approximately 450 nucleotides in the SP genome downstream of the peplomer S gene. Sequencing of cDNA clones confirmed that SP virus contained a 462 -nucleotide deletion, eliminating the transcriptional recognition sequences for both RNAs 3 and 4. These RNAs encode open reading frames A and B, respectively. An alternative consensus recognition sequence was not readily apparent for the delta 4 RNA species of SP virus. Since open reading frame A is missing in SP virus, it is not essential for a productive infection. The status of the potential protein encoded by open reading frame B is not clear, because it may be missing or just truncated.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work was to study changes {{in the balance of}} fluids, {{electrolytes}} and blood metabolites in neonatal piglets with severe <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Six two day old conventional piglets were infected with <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> virus while six others were used as normal controls. Blood samples were collected in heparin when the infected piglets were moribund. The following variables were measured: packed red cell volume, total plasma protein and bicarbonate, blood pH, blood urea nitrogen and plasma glucose, creatinine, chloride, inorganic phosphorus, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Vomiting and diarrhea appeared 12 to 24 hours postinoculation in the infected piglets and they were moribund one or two days later. Before becoming moribund, most of the piglets fell rapidly into a lethargic and comatose state. The most evident changes in their blood variables were an increase in packed cell volume, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium levels and a decrease in pH and bicarbonate concentration as well as a severe hypoglycemia. The results suggest that severe hypoglycemia coupled with metabolic acidosis and dehydration might be an important factor contributing to the high mortality rates caused by <b>transmissible</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> in neonatal piglets. The hypoglycemia results from a combination of the inadequate glucose metabolism inherent to neonatal piglets and the acute maldigestion and malabsorption resulting from the diffuse and severe villous atrophy induced by the virus...|$|E
