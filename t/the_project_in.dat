5|$|Market {{research}} conducting during 1997 {{revealed that}} airlines wanted a smaller {{aircraft in the}} 70-80-seat range. As the project proceeded, there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus. China wanted a larger aircraft than originally envisioned. In addition, there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare, and a weak business case. STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>in</b> 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>in</b> July that year.
