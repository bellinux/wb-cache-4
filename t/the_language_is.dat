5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> dialectally more diverse and is written in the {{traditional}} Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} to be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare's first plays {{were written}} in the {{conventional}} style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from {{the needs of the}} characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.|$|E
5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} Basque grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country.|$|E

Tamil or dialects of it were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern Andhra Pradesh districts of Chittoor and Nellore until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as Kolar, Mysore, Mandya and Bangalore.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayas speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano {{in daily}} life. Boholano-Bisaya is the dominantly used {{language}} among the languages spoken {{by the members}} of the Eskayan tribe. This variety is used in their close familial interactions, in their conversations with their neighbors in the community, in their transactions in the barangay, school meetings, social gatherings, church rituals and in the trade and commerce. However, they are better known for an auxiliary language, known as Eskayan, or Ineskaya, which is used for prayers, songs, and formal speeches. Lexically, Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language (however, considered to be an encryption of Cebuano) although there is strong but inconsistent Spanish influence. A striking feature of <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> its unusual phonotactics.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 500 speakers in the Southern Basque Country in Spain, approximately 2% {{of a population}} of 21,000 Romanis, and another estimated 500 in France. In Spain the remaining fluent speakers are elderly people mostly {{over the age of}} 80; some are equally fluent in Spanish, Basque, or Caló. Middle-aged Erromintxela are mostly passive bilinguals, and the youngest speak only Basque or Spanish. In the Northern Basque Country, however, <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> still being passed on to children. The percentage of speakers among Spanish Erromintxela are higher than 2%, as large numbers of Caló-speaking Romanis moved to the Basque Country in the intense period of industrialisation in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> unclear, {{which leads to}} the trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{landing on}} the Island, she decides to join Sayid on a hike to {{transmit}} a distress signal, after she and Boone have an argument about her selfishness. When they discover a French looped signal already being transmitted, Shannon's knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>is</b> used to translate it. Later, Shannon has an asthma attack, but her inhalers are nowhere to be found. Sun (Yunjin Kim) cures her, by using eucalyptus plants to help her breathing. Because of her selfish and manipulative behavior, Boone brands Shannon useless. Sayid enlists her to help translate the maps belonging to the French woman who made the radio transmission, Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan). Shannon and Sayid soon form a romantic relationship. After returning from a romantic night along the beach with Sayid, she learns Boone has died after falling from a great height. At his funeral, Shannon does not speak, but allows Sayid to talk instead. Shannon holds Locke (Terry O'Quinn) responsible for Boone's death, and asks Sayid to take action. When he refuses, she steals {{the key to the}} gun case from Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and holds Locke at gunpoint in the jungle. When Rousseau arrives on the beach one morning to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival, Shannon prepares to migrate to the caves {{with the rest of the}} group. Before leaving on the raft the survivors have built, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley) gives Shannon guardianship of his dog, Vincent, as a means to help her recover from her loss.|$|E
