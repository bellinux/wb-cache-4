30|$|For {{portable}} {{power source}} device applications, passive DEFCs seems more suitable and reliable compared to active DEFCs {{due to the}} fuel delivery concept and easy handling. The passive feeding system employ the natural capillary force without involving any pump for fuel and air breathing to supply oxygen for the redox reactions. Hence, no additional power consumption is required. The compact and light structure of a single cell can be developed for a compact device, which is different from active cells that require an external pump and blower, thus enlarging the cell [5 – 7]. Unfortunately, two disadvantages of passive DEFCs impede their commercial use: the sluggish electro-kinetic reactions of the anode and the high ethanol permeability from anode to the cathode [8]. Currently, Nafion® is used in DEFCs and also used in other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> in acidic and alkaline medium due to its high proton conductivity and high mechanical stability.

The goal of the presented methodology for integrating and optimising fuel cell systems is to help in this preliminary design step.
