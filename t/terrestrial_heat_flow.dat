In this article, {{based on}} the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data, the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> map in the area, {{geothermal}} gradient map and different depth geothermal contour map of study area within the Territory of China, I explored respectively the relationship between geothermal field and tectonic, geologic structures by analyzing respectively the corresponding relationships between the structural diagram and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> diagram, temperature contour map, geothermal gradient map in study area. The main conclusions are as follows. Geothermal field has been restricted by the India plate and Eurasian plate collision. So the study area {{as a whole is}} a geothermal abnormal area. Features of regional geological structure control the geothermal flow distribution. Geothermal abrupt changing occurs between different tectonic units. Introductions The formation and evolution of various types of energy resources was controlled by the geothermal field [1], so as geothermal resources. Besides, geothermal field {{played an important role in}} the evolution of orogenic belts and structure also had a great influence on the formation and distribution of geothermal resources.

40|$|Numerical {{models of}} {{three-dimensional}} thermal convection in highly viscous spherical shells with {{different combinations of}} internal and basal heating consistently have upwelling concentrations {{in the form of}} cylindrical plumes and downwelling in planar sheets. As the proportion of internal heating increases, the number of upwelling plumes increases, and downwelling sheets become more vigorous and time-dependent. With any amount of basal heating, the entire convective pattern, during its evolution, is anchored to the upwelling plumes. As the proportion of internal heating increases, the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> carried by the upwelling plumes remains a large fraction of the basal <b>heat</b> <b>flow.</b> Downwelling sheets carry only a minor fraction (approximately 30 percent) of the basal <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (even when the shell is entirely heated from below), but they advect almost all of the internally generated heat. The relatively large number of plumes in the earth's mantle (inferred from hotspots), the possibility that downwelling slabs are vigorous enough to penetrate the lower mantle, and the small fraction of <b>terrestrial</b> surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> carried by plumes all suggest that the mantle is predominantly heated from within...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} extent to which {{regional}} variations in continental <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> can be interpreted, making use of a <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> data set from east and southern Africa. The first-order observation deriving from these <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> measurements is a common pattern characterized in both regions by low <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in Archean cratons and higher <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in younger mobile belts. Two regional differences between east and southern Africa are superimposed on this common <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> pattern: (1) <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in the Tanzania Craton is about 13 mW m- 2 lower than in the Kalahari Craton, and (2) <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in the Mozambique Belt in east Africa is about 9 mW m- 2 lower than in the southern African mobile belts, within about 250 km of the respective Archean cratons. The differences in <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> between east and southern Africa suggest that the thermal structure of the lithosphere beneath these regions differs somewhat, and we attempt to resolve these differences in lithospheric thermal structure by examining four explanations that could account for the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> observations: (1) diminished <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> in shallow boreholes in east Africa; (2) less crustal heat production in the regions of lower heat flow; (3) thicker lithosphere beneath the regions of lower heat flow; (4) cooler mantle beneath the areas of lower <b>heat</b> <b>flow.</b> We find it difficult to interpret uniquely the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> differences between east and southern Africa because available constraints on crustal heat production, crustal structure, lithospheric thickness and mantle temperatures are insufficient to discriminate among the possible explanations. Hence, extracting significant information about lithospheric thermal structure from regional <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> variations requires more ancillary geochemical and geophysical information than Africa presently offers...|$|R

Of these 5 localities, one (Takamatsu) is a coal mine, while the other 4 (Izuhara, Kushikino, Makimine, Taio) are metal mines. Geothermal gradients measured in these localities are 2. 93 °C/ 100 w in Izuhara (Taishu mine), 3. 06 ℃/ 100 m in Takamatsu, 1. 71 ℃/ 100 m in Taio, and 2. 57 ℃/ 100 m in Makimine, respectively. In Kushikino no reliable thermal gradient was obtained. Combining the thermal gradients with thermal conductivity of rocks in each locality, values of heat flux were obtained as follows; 2. 18 × 1 O- 6 cal/cm 2 sec in Izuhara, 1. 92 × 1 O- 6 cal/cm 2 sec in Takamatsu, 1. 79 × 1 O- 6 cal/cm 2 sec in Makimine, and 1. 05 × 1 O- 6 cal/cm 2 sec in Taio.

40|$|Abstract. In the United States, {{the surface}} <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> can be {{separated}} into two main components. The first component {{is due to}} radioactive heat sources in the upper crust, and the second component is due to sources in the lower crust and upper mantle. The <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> from the lower crust and upper mantle is constant over large regions, called <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> provinces, and the transitions between provinces are very narrow (less than 100 km). High values of mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (> 1. 4 ìcal/cm 2 sec) occur in the Basin and Range, Columbia Plateaus, Northern Rocky Mountains, Southern Rocky Mountains physiographic provinces, and in the Franciscan rocks east of the San Andreas fault zone. Normal or near-normal mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (0. 8) {{is found in the}} United States east of the Rocky Mountains, in the Colorado Plateaus, the Southern California batholith, and in the Puget Sound Region. Subnormal mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> (0. 4, the lowest known anywhere) occurs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The variations in mantle <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> are attributed to the thermal effects of sea-floor spreading during the Cenozoic.

Several procedures for calculating heat flows for Mars from geophysical or geological proxies have been used, which are valid for the time when the structures used as indicators were formed.

On the other hand, several works by Kargel and co-workers have estimated martian heat flows from scaling the present-day <b>terrestrial</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> to Mars, but the so-obtained values are much higher than those deduced from lithospheric strength.

40|$|<b>Terrestrial</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> density, q, is {{inversely}} {{correlated with}} the age, t, of tectono-magmatic activity in the Earth's crust (Polyak and Smirnov, 1966; etc.). «Heat flow-age dependence» indicates unknown temporal heat sources in the interior considered a priori as the mantle-derived diapirs. The validity of this hypothesis is demonstrated by studying the helium isotope ratio, 3 He/ 4 He = R, in subsurface fluids. This study discovered the positive correlation between the regionally averaged (background) estimations of R- and q-values (Polyak et al., 1979 a). Such a correlation manifests itself in both pan-regional scales (Norhtern Eurasia) and separate regions, e. g., Japan (Sano et al., 1982), Eger Graben (Polyak et al., 1985) Eastern China rifts (Du, 1992), Southern Italy (Italiano et al., 2000), and elsewhere. The R-q relation indicates a coupled heat and mass transfer from the mantle into the crust. From considerations of heat-mass budget this transfer can be provided by the flux consisting of silicate matter rather than He or other volatiles. This conclusion is confirmed by the correlation between 3 He/ 4 He and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in {{the products of the}} volcanic and hydrothermal activity in Italy (Polyak et al., 1979 b; Parello et al., 2000) and other places.

When the boundary <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> equals to 20 W·cm- 2, the growth of longitudinal side branches is accelerated and the growth of transverse side branches is restrained, and meanwhile, there is dendritic remelting in the calculation domain. When the boundary <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> equals to 40 W·cm- 2, the growths of the transverse and longitudinal side branches compete with each other, and when the boundary <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> equals to 100 - 200 W·cm- 2, the growth of transverse side branches dominates absolutely. The temperature field of dendritic growth was analyzed and the relation between boundary <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> and temperature field was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The average <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> through {{continental}} orogenic belts decreases {{with the}} age of the orogeny to an approximately constant value for the Pre-cambrian shields and platforms. The average <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> for provinces of the North Pacific decreases with {{the age of}} the province. The mean <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> through the province younger than 10 million years is 2. 82 p cal cm- 2 - 1 whereas the mean <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> through provinces older than the middle Cretaceous is 1. 1 5 ~ cal cm- 2 s-'. The contrast in the chemical composition of continental and oceanic crustal rocks and the disparity in time scale for the decay of <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> suggest a different explanation for the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> through oceans and continents. The observed equality of the mean oceanic and continental <b>heat</b> <b>flows</b> may not be relevant to evaluating the thermal contribution of the upper mantle. Two geophysical and geochemical models of the oceanic and continen-tal crust and upper mantle are presented. Both can explain the near equality of <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> through the Precambrian shields and the old ocea...|$|R
50|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the MTJ is similar to what would be expected in a subduction environment. That is, <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> is low above the subducting Gorda slab, between 40-50 mW/m². South of the MTJ, <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> through the California coast is higher, around 90 mW/m². The distance south of the MTJ over which <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> increases gives an indication of the timing of development of the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> anomaly. The observed surface <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> doubles over a distance of ~200 km, corresponding to a timeframe of migration of 4-5 Ma. It is also consistent with a source for the anomaly, thought to be asthenospheric mantle material, emplaced at shallow depths of 15-25 km, i.e. in the slab window. This rise of the <b>heat</b> <b>flow</b> anomaly time implies that there is probably only a thin crustal lid above the slab window.|$|R
