5|$|In August 2008, a new {{search was}} announced, {{to be led}} by Robert Grenier, a senior {{archaeologist}} with Parks Canada. This search hoped {{to take advantage of}} the improved ice conditions, using side-scan sonar from a boat in open water. Grenier also hoped <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> newly published Inuit testimony collected by oral historian Dorothy Harley Eber. Some of Eber's informants have placed the location of one of Franklin's ships in the vicinity of the Royal Geographical Society Island, an area not searched by previous expeditions. The search was to also include local Inuit historian Louie Kamookak, who has found other significant remains of the expedition and would represent the indigenous culture.|$|E
5|$|LaVey's estranged {{daughter}} Zeena Schreck, in an exposé {{about both}} her father's religion and past, attributes {{the birth of}} The Satanic Bible to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon. According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> {{the popularity of the}} 1968 horror film Rosemary's Baby, which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and other occult practices. Schreck states that, aided by Diane Hegarty, LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in The Cloven Hoof, a Church of Satan newsletter.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I think it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many.

I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E

5|$|Club captain Noel Spencer was {{released}} by the Mariners, then signed {{to participate in the}} Asian Champions League by Sydney FC after the 2006–07 season, and Alex Wilkinson was appointed the new captain. Only 22 years of age at the time, Wilkinson had played every possible competitive match for the Mariners up to his appointment. In February 2008, Central Coast Mariners signed an arrangement with English Football League Championship side Sheffield United. The partnership was one of several connections the Mariners made with foreign clubs; other partner clubs included Ferencváros of Hungary, Chengdu Blades of China and São Paulo of Brazil. The agreement benefits the club by providing an opportunity for the youth programme and senior side <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> the roster of Sheffield United through transfers. The teams also formed a property development joint venture, in the hopes that Central Coast could use its share of income to expand and bolster their Mariners Youth Academy.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E

His kidnapping and extortion rackets still produced sufficient income. For the first eight months of the year, he dominated the forces of law in his bailiwick—staging numerous ambushes and occasionally attacking their headquarters.|$|E
25|$|A HVDC {{back-to-back}} {{station with}} a maximum transmission rate of 40 megawatts was built at Broken Hill in 1986, <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> the National Grid. It consists of 2 static inverters working with a voltage of 8.33 kV. After this station was operational, the two other power stations closed and the equipment was gradually removed from the Central Power Station.

25|$|Clinicians have a {{wide range}} of {{individual}} interventions <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from,</b> often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E

50|$|In statistics, some Monte Carlo methods require {{independent}} {{observations in}} a sample <b>to</b> be <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> a one-dimensional distribution in sorted order.

The special case of drawing n sorted observations from the uniform distribution on 0,1 is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>from</b> the uniform distribution on an n-dimensional simplex; this task {{is a part of}} sequential importance resampling.|$|R

25|$|With {{nearly every}} explanation, Fulgentius {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a small quotation {{as an example of}} the word’s practical use, often citing the work it was taken from. However, many of these quotes are likely to be faked. Some works may be entirely made-up, while others have been liberally edited by Fulgentius. As was common with writers of this period, Fulgentius does not cite his immediate sources, perhaps in an attempt to obscure the fact that he had access to very few <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from.</b> The entire work was probably an attempt to improve his reputation as a scholar in hopes the reader would not take a critical look into his methods.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Western art, drawing the human figure from living models was {{considered}} {{the most effective way}} to develop the skill of draftsmanship. First, it is best <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> life, rather than copying two dimensional images such as photographs. Second, an artist has a connection to drawing another human being that cannot exist with any other subject. Models for life drawing classes are usually nude. In the classroom setting, where the purpose is to learn how to draw the human form in all the different shapes, ages and ethnicity, there are no real limitations on who the model can be. In some cases, the model may pose with various props, one or more other models, against real or artificial background, in natural or artificial light and so on.|$|E
