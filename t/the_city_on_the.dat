5|$|Late at night, the Royalist generals reached York, {{with many}} routed troops and stragglers. The Governor of York, Sir Thomas Glemham, allowed {{only those who}} were part of the {{garrison}} (in effect, only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers) into the city, in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heels of the fleeing Royalists. Many fugitives, including wounded, crowded the streets before Micklegate Bar, the western gate into the city.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the fair}} idea was conceived, several sites were {{considered}}. Among the sites considered within Seattle were Duwamish Head in West Seattle; Fort Lawton (now Discovery Park) in the Magnolia neighborhood; and First Hill—even closer to Downtown than the site finally selected, {{but far more}} densely developed. Two sites {{south of the city}} proper were considered—Midway, near Des Moines, and the Army Depot in Auburn—as was a site east of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south shore of Lake Sammamish.|$|E

5|$|Regent Street {{was one of}} {{the first}} planned {{developments}} of London. The desire to impose order on the city's medieval street pattern dates back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans for rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classical formal model, but progress was slow and houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.|$|E
5|$|Villa Somalia is the {{official}} residential palace and principal workplace of the President of Somalia, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed.

5|$|At Altoona, {{the route}} again {{overlaps}} I-80 until Newton, where it splits away from I-80. The highway passes near {{or through the}} cities of Kellogg, Grinnell, Victor, Marengo, the Amana Colonies, and Tiffin before entering the Coralville / Iowa City area. Through Coralville and Iowa City, US6 has no direct access to I-80, I-380, or US218; other routes like Iowa Highway 1 (Iowa1) and Iowa965 provide direct access. From Iowa City, the highway heads to the east-southeast through West Liberty and Atalissa. Near Wilton, the route heads north to I-80 where it again overlaps to Davenport. At Davenport, US6 then follows I-280 and US61 before entering <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of Davenport, it joins I-74 and enters Bettendorf before leaving Iowa for Illinois.|$|E

5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and {{his entourage}} flew into Munich. From the airport they drove to the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{schools in}} Florida {{threatened}} to expel students for attending Marilyn Manson concerts, and over 5,500 residents contacted {{the mayor of}} Jacksonville, demanding that he cancel their April 17 concert at the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum. The city council of Richmond, Virginia ordered the cancelation of their May 10 concert at Richmond Coliseum, although the ACLU would later sue <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> band's behalf. A July 22 concert at La Luna in Portland, Oregon was canceled when the venue was unable to obtain insurance for the event. Their concert at Calgary's Max Bell Arena three days later was canceled by {{the owner of the}} venue, Larry Ryckman, who cited the band's reputation as justification for doing so. He would later be successfully sued by the band's promoters for $66,000 in damages. The New Jersey date of Ozzfest at Giants Stadium was canceled by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, who cited Marilyn Manson's scheduled appearance as its reason. The event was only held after Ozzy Osbourne successfully sued the state, which compelled authorities to allow the concert.|$|E
5|$|Erbil was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century. It {{remained}} an important Christian centre until the 9th century, when {{the bishop of}} Erbil moved his seat to Mosul. From {{the first half of}} the 12th century until 1233, Erbil was the seat of the Begteginids, a Turcoman dynasty that rose to prominence under the reign of Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul. Muzaffar al-Din Gökböri, the second dynast of the Begtegenid dynasty and a staunch supporter of Saladin, created a lower town around <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> citadel mound and founded hospitals and madrasahs. Gökburi died in 1233 without an heir and control of Erbil shifted to the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir after he had besieged the city.|$|E

5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, {{they were told that}} the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E
5|$|Point 343 {{was held}} through the 18th, however, though {{with the loss}} of 63 men; by the evening, a force of tanks had managed to come up and {{stabilise}} the position with the aid of artillery support. The 4th/11th Sikh Regiment moved around the Gurkhas to the north, covering the northern flank of the San Marino heights, and the division's 11th Brigade passed through them to help encircle <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> evening of the 19th, the 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 11th Indian Infantry Brigade began to push into {{the outskirts of the city}} from the north, but early on the morning of the 20th were held back by defensive positions in the north-west of the city, where the road to the upper part of the city, situated higher on the mountain, began. Tanks moved into the suburbs, whilst a company of the Camerons moved uphill toward the summit in heavy rain. The city was secured by the early afternoon, with only 24 casualties among the attackers, and 54 prisoners taken.|$|E
5|$|The 15th then pursued {{retreating}} German {{forces in}} the direction of Poltava. Late on 16February it captured Zalyutino and engaged German troops at Pesochnya on the road to Liubotyn. After capturing Pesochnya two days later, the 15th began the battle for Liubotyn against troops of the Grossdeutschland Division, but became bogged down in heavy fighting for the city. The corps' 195th Tank Brigade and the 160th Division were ordered to bypass the city and attempt to capture Staryi Merchik. On 21February they advanced on Liubotyn from the west, and the Grossdeutschland Division began its retreat from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next day. In the battle for Liubotyn between 21and 22February, the corps reported killing 400 German soldiers and destroying 12 tanks, while suffering losses of 360 killed and wounded and six tanks.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Gythium {{was fought}} in 195 BC between Sparta and the {{coalition}} of Rome, Rhodes, the Achaean League and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Achaeans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. The Spartans held out {{but one of the}} joint commanders, Dexagoridas, decided to surrender the city to the Roman legate. When Gorgopas, the other commander, found out, he killed Dexagoridas and took solo command of the city. After Dexagoridas' murder the Spartans held out more vigorously. However, Titus Quinctius Flamininus of the allied forces arrived with 4,000 more men and the Spartans decided to surrender <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that the garrison could leave unharmed. The result of this battle forced Nabis, the tyrant of Sparta, to abandon the surrounding land and withdraw to the city of Sparta. Later that year, Sparta capitulated to the allies.|$|E
5|$|The British {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} the fortifications {{a number of times}} in the 19th century. The first proposal was made by Major-General Henry Pigot {{at the beginning of the}} century. In 1853, a proposal was made to demolish Saint James Cavalier to make way for a military hospital. In 1855, Sir John Lysaght Pennefather {{proposed the}} construction of a citadel on the high ground of the Sciberras peninsula, on the site of the Valletta Land Front and the surrounding area. In 1872, the demolition of the city's outworks was proposed, while the demolition of the entire land front was suggested in 1882. Eventually, the fortifications were left largely intact, and the only part that was demolished was St. Madeleine's Lunette, which was located near the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> site now occupied by the Triton Fountain).|$|E

5|$|The {{personal}} experiences of many Londoners during the fire are glimpsed in letters and memoirs. The two best-known diarists of the Restoration are Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) and John Evelyn (1620–1706), and both recorded {{the events and}} their own reactions day by day, and made great efforts to keep themselves informed {{of what was happening}} all over the City and beyond. For example, they both travelled out to the Moorfields park area north of <b>the</b> <b>City</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wednesday—the fourth day—to view the mighty encampment of distressed refugees there, which shocked them. Their diaries are the most important sources for all modern retellings of the disaster. Books on the fire by Tinniswood (2003) and Hanson (2001) also rely on the brief memoirs of William Taswell (1651–82), who was a fourteen year-old schoolboy at Westminster School in 1666.|$|E
5|$|When Maryland {{assigned}} state route {{numbers in}} 1927, MD 2 was designated between Solomons and Baltimore.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Greek advance, the fortresses of Bizani and Kastritsa were cut off by 16h and isolated {{from the rest of the}} Ottoman army and its headquarters in Ioannina. As night fell, the forts ceased firing, and their garrisons abandoned them, trying to cut through the rather loose Greek encirclement to Ioannina. In their attempt to withdraw towards Ioannina, a significant number of Ottoman troops, totaling 35 officers and 935 soldiers, were captured by the Greek units positioned on the city's southern outskirts. Several Ottoman positions capitulated the next morning, although Bizani and Kastritsa continued to resist until after the surrender. Meanwhile, Esat Pasha realized that the battle was lost, and tried to evacuate as many troops and wounded as he could to the north. As the Greeks pressed their advance however, he contacted the city's foreign consulates to seek help in negotiating a surrender. At 23:00 on , he agreed upon the unconditional surrender of Ioannina and the Ottoman garrison to the Greeks. The following day the Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine were parading through the flag-covered streets of <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, Esat Pasha upon arriving in Turkey was welcomed as a national hero.|$|E
