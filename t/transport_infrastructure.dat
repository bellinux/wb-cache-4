5|$|Water-power {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power {{to the process of}} producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills– sometimes developing a pre-existing community– with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Along with the <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> form part of the site. A <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> was built to open new markets for the mills' produce.|$|E

40|$|The {{role played}} by <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> such as motorways, railway {{stations}} and airports on local employment growth remains debated and partially inconclusive, especially for small municipalities located in metropolitan margins. This paper examines {{the case of the}} Paris region. Based on a logistic regression model using municipal-level employment data (1993 – 2008), it aims at assessing whether municipalities with small amounts of employment are likely to experience high employment growth depending on their location vis-à-vis <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Motorways are found to have an influence for very small areas and airports for bigger ones. However, the role of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is rather limited when the analysis is differentiated according to economic sectors. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the {{transport}} sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> on the economic growth of both regions and sectors, distinguishing among modes of transport. It also attempts to capture the spillover effects or network effects associated with <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Two different methodologies are used: the first adopts an accounting approach {{on the basis of}} a regression on total factor productivity (TFP) indices, the second uses econometric estimates of the production function. Our study obtains very similar elasticities with both methodologies for the private sector of the economy, both for the aggregate capital stock of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and for the various types of infrastructure. Important network effects of these infrastructures on the private sector have also been observed. However, the disaggregated results for sectors of production are not conclusive. ...|$|R

The full compatibility of such synergy ‘transport – electrical power transmission’ involves different branches of engineering.

The manuscript aims at highlighting a procedural approach that should be followed in order to analyse all the key elements involved in the safe operation of power transmission lines hosted in <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> First, the geometrical compatibility between different types of power transmission technologies, (i. e. gas insulated lines and high-voltage direct/alternating current insulated cable lines), and <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (i. e. motorway galleries, railway galleries and railway prospection tunnels) is considered. Subsequently, the behaviour and magnitude of the magnetic field generated by the different power transmission technologies inside the <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are presented. Moreover, the study analyses the effects of a phase-to-screen short circuit that could occur inside the hosting facility. Finally, an analysis of the reliability of the synergy between power transmission systems and <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract–The {{availability}} {{and performance of}} <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are very important in supporting freight transportation. The reliable <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are needed to support industrial activities in the certain region. The access of industries to supply routes must be evaluated {{in accordance with the}} existing <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and the potential location of factories and distribution. This study is intended to utilize the freight network simulation, especially using ArcGIS software, by considering spatial and transportation factors as the input, and government regulation as the constraints, to analyze modal competition between unimodal and inter-modal CPO transportation in regional scale by considering the generalized costs as the efficiency indicator of transportation system. The result of analysis shows that inter-modal network (combination of road and river) provides the high probability compare to uni-modal (road or river only) network.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E
