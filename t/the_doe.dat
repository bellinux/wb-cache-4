5|$|When The Daily Californian {{published}} {{excerpts from}} the Argonne letter on June 11, <b>the</b> <b>DOE</b> obtained {{a court order to}} prevent further publication. Undeterred, The Daily Californian published the letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, <b>the</b> <b>DOE</b> declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting The Daily Californian from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the Madison Press Connection on September 16. The government then moved to dismiss their cases against both The Progressive and The Daily Californian as moot.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator John Glenn, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services. They were concerned about information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to <b>the</b> <b>DOE,</b> which classified it.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} {{concern has been}} the {{standard}} of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, <b>the</b> <b>DOE</b> issued {{a draft of the}} Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10,000years mean public dose would be 0.24mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made <b>the</b> <b>DOE</b> responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that <b>the</b> <b>DOE</b> is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
5|$|Polonium was {{administered}} to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally given to a fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons {{who had not been}} exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. <b>The</b> <b>DoE</b> factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a {{physicist}} at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to Chuck Hansen. Hansen was a computer programmer from Mountain View, California, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner {{of which would be}} the first person to have their design classified by <b>the</b> <b>DOE.</b> It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, He wrote a letter to Senator Charles H. Percy detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, Ted Taylor, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.|$|E

60|$|Several {{political}} sonnets, and others, {{were written}} in 1807; also the Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle, and the first and larger part of <b>The</b> White <b>Doe</b> of Rylstone, with a few minor fragments.
