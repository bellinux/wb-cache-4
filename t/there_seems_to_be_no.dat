5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding {{in the trunk of}} Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E
5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, {{who was also a}} royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were {{brought to the attention of}} King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that music of Wagner was used at the Dachau concentration camp in 1933/4 to 'reeducate' political prisoners by exposure to 'national music'.

25|$|The {{main issue}} with anticoagulation in {{pregnancy}} is that warfarin, {{the most commonly}} used anticoagulant in chronic administration, is known to have teratogenic effects on the fetus if administered in early pregnancy. Still, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> teratogenic effect of warfarin before six weeks of gestation. However, unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin do not cross the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Most vocal literalist creationists {{are from}} the US, and strict creationist views are much less common in other {{developed}} countries.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{proof that}} he belonged {{to the family of}} famous architects of the same name, which {{included}} Domenico Fontana. Born in Brusato, near Como (now part of the town of Novazzano in Canton Ticino, Switzerland), Fontana went to Rome before 1655. He became a draughtsman for the architectural plans of Pietro da Cortona, Carlo Rainaldi, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Bernini employed him for nearly a decade in diverse projects.|$|E
25|$|Sky {{surveys and}} {{mappings}} {{of the various}} wavelength bands of electromagnetic radiation (in particular 21-cm emission) have yielded much information on the content and character of the universe's structure. The organization of structure appears to follow as a hierarchical model with organization up to the scale of superclusters and filaments. Larger than this (at scales between 30–200 megaparsecs), <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> continued structure, a phenomenon that {{has been referred to}} as the End of Greatness.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the big railroads heard many rumors {{regarding}} possible sources of the mysterious funding, and Henry Rogers' name had been mentioned, along with just about every other wealthy industrialist.

Rumors notwithstanding, <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> credible evidence that the {{leaders of the}} N/C had any confirmation of the Rogers involvement until he and Page were ready for them to know.|$|E

Most of the Baha'i are of Persian descent, although <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> many among the Azerbaijani and Kurdish people. The Baha'i are severely persecuted.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the work}} of the 19th century onward little can be said in praise. Outside and beyond the present-day fashion for {{collecting}} old oak <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> demand for carved decoration. In church work a certain number of carvers find occupation, as also for repairs or the production of imitations. But the carving one is accustomed to see in hotels or on board the modern ocean palace is in the main {{the work of}} the machine, often with finishing work done by human workers.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of hearing}} damage {{also depends on}} the {{exposure}} time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to OSHA work safety guidelines, workers should be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> specific consensus {{on the level of}} exposure. NIOSH has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.|$|E
25|$|When a Polistes instabilis nest is attacked, the wasps {{defend their}} nests by {{responding}} {{in two different}} ways: First they perform a threat response by wagging their gaster and vibrating their wings, and second, some wasps may attack by leaving the nest and physically touching the attacker. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> relationship {{between the amount of}} investment the wasps have put into their nest and the defense response. This suggests that there are a fixed number of wasps that are semi specialized for nest defense, and such defensive tasks may be assigned {{in the same way as}} other tasks such as foraging.|$|E

25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} the premise of a self-regulating psyche composed of tensions between opposing attitudes of the ego and the unconscious. A neurosis is a significant unresolved tension between these contending attitudes. Each neurosis is unique, and different things work in different cases, so no therapeutic method can be arbitrarily applied. Nevertheless, there is a set of cases that Jung especially addressed. Although adjusted well enough to everyday life, the individual has lost a fulfilling sense of meaning and purpose, and has no living religious belief to which to turn. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> readily apparent way to set matters right. In these cases, Jung turned to ongoing symbolic communication from the unconscious in the form of dreams and visions.|$|E
25|$|The MRHA, the Sedition Act, section 298A of the Penal Code and the ISA {{all share}} an {{underlying}} objective: to maintain public order. The greatest {{disparity between the}} MRHA and the other pieces of legislation {{lies in the fact}} that the former provides for a much more benign resolution of issues. One commentator has said that <b>there</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> apparent purpose for having a wide array of outcomes to choose from when dealing with the same mischief – religious disharmony. On the other hand, it might be argued that given a highly sensitive topic like religion, which incites deep feelings, an arsenal of options is vital so that an outcome best suiting the scenario can be tailored. Nevertheless, the MRHA, despite having the least severe consequences, has not yet been invoked.|$|E
25|$|Most single-breasted suits {{have two}} or three buttons, and one or four buttons are unusual (except that dinner jackets ("black tie") often have only one button). It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, {{although}} zoot suits can have as many as six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons, since the button placement is critical to the overall impression of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line up quite closely with the natural waistline. <b>There</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> clear rule as to which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place.|$|E
