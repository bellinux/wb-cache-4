5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no faster than <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> nerves can send impulses {{to command the}} muscles to beat.

40|$|In raw sludges and in mesophilically and thermophilically digested {{anaerobic}} sludges, large {{variations in}} numbers of viruses occurred over narrow ranges of numbers of fecal coliforms, total coliforms, and fecal streptococci, demonstrating that the bacteria were poor quantitative reflectors {{of the numbers}} of the viruses detected.

40|$|Hannan, West, and Barron {{investigate}} {{the development of}} credit unions over time, focusing on organizational processes that shaped and continue to determine the evolution of credit unions. They clarify how the potential for future development of the credit union movement is shaped by the past dynamics of American credit union development, the growth of competing forms of deposit institutions, and government regulation. They use the theoretical and methodological perspective of organizational ecology. This approach to organizational analysis seeks to understand how social conditions affect <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> new organizations and new organizational forms arise, <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> organizations change their fundamental features, and <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> organizations and organizational forms die out. Hannan, West, and Barron posed hypotheses that apply to many kinds of organizational populations and collected credit union data appropriate for testing these hypotheses. Their research reveals a number of informative patterns in the proliferation and growth of credit unions. These patterns suggest strong parallels with the dynamics of other kinds of organizational populations. Consequently, they conclude that their research indicates that organizational ecology theory can help us better understand the evolution of credit unions...|$|R
