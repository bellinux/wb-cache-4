5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E

25|$|Mike Caldwell pitched {{his second}} win of the Series and almost went the distance. The Brewers struck first on Ted Simmons's bases loaded groundout {{in the first}} off of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied {{the game in the}} third on Keith Hernandez's RBI double. The Brewers took a 2–1 lead in the bottom half on Cecil Cooper's groundout with runners on first and third and added to their lead on Paul Molitor's RBI single in the fifth. George Hendrick's RBI single in the seventh cut the Brewers lead to 3–2, but <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> run back {{in the bottom of the}} inning on Robin Yount's home run, then added to their lead in the eighth on {{back-to-back}} RBI singles by Charlie Moore and Jim Gantner off of Bruce Sutter. The Cardinals staged a late rally in the ninth as Keith Hernandez doubled in a run and George Hendrick singled him in with two outs. Bob McClure came in and allowed a single to Darrell Porter, putting the tying run on base. McClure, however, struck out Willie McGee, then retired pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to end the game. Robin Yount set a World Series record by recording his second four-hit game, his first came in Game 1. To this day, Yount remains the only player to have multiple 4-hit games in one World Series.|$|E

The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned.

500|$|... "Summer Love" [...] is an uptempo pop song, with {{a length}} of four minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to digital sheet music published at Musinotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, [...] "Summer Love" [...] {{was written in the}} key of D minor, in common time with a moderately slow 96 beat-per-minute tempo. Timberlake's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of A5. Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, drums, guitar, piano and handclaps. [...] Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine praised the song and commented that [...] "with its good foot hesitation boom-clap and cascading chorus synthline" [...] 'Summer Love' shows Timberlake's best vocals on FutureSex/LoveSounds." [...] Schwartz further stated that [...] "the beat drops out while he sings in perfect harmony, 'Tell me how <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl'". [...] Lyrically, the single is about [...] "wanting {{to fall in love with}} the lusty seasonal lover".|$|E

The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. Glenn, wrote Tom Wolfe, [...] "came out of it as tops among seven very fair-haired boys. He had the hottest record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most photogenic, and the lone Marine."

500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{popularity}} in its era, {{the importance of the}} album for the development of punk rock music was incredible, influencing many of the most well-known names in punk rock, including the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, the Clash, Black Flag, Misfits, and Green Day. Billie Joe Armstrong, singer for Green Day, explained his reasoning for listening to the band: [...] "they had songs that just stuck in your head, just like a hammer they banged right into your brain." [...] The album also had a great impact on the English punk scene as well, with the bassist for Generation X, Tony James, saying that the album caused English bands to change their style. [...] "When their album came out," [...] commented James, [...] "all the English groups tripled speed overnight. Two-minute-long songs, very fast." [...] In another interview, James stated that [...] "Everybody went up three gears the day <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] In 1999, Classic Albums by Collins GEM recognized Ramones as the start of English punk rock and called it the fastest and hardest music that could possibly be concocted, stating: [...] "The songs within were a short, sharp exercise in vicious speed-thrash, driven by ferocious guitars and yet halting in an instant. It was the simple pop dream taken to its minimalist extreme." [...] In 2012 the album was preserved by the National Recording Registry, deeming it [...] "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant." ...|$|E
500|$|The Church of Scientology {{released}} a statement regarding the February 10, 2008 worldwide protests, which was published February 7, 2008 in the St. Petersburg Times. In the statement, the Church of Scientology called {{the organizers of the}} protests [...] "cyberterrorists", and stated: [...] "We take this seriously {{because of the nature of}} the threats this group has made publicly. We will take every step necessary to protect our parishioners and staff as well as members of the community, in coordination with the local authorities." [...] The statement also referred to the actions of members of Project Chanology as [...] "hate crimes" [...] and [...] "religious bigotry", and in a media release said that the group is guided by Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf; one of the organizers of the protest responded to the latter allegation by stating: [...] "I don't know where <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> from, but I don't think that's true considering that I am a capitalist and a Jew". Pat Harney, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "We are dealing with a worldwide threat ... This is not a light matter." [...] In preparation for the February 10, 2008 protests outside Scientology's spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, the Church of Scientology spent $4,500 to hire ten off-duty police officers for security. Clearwater Police Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Daly-Watts stated that the off-duty police officers will make sure that protesters do not trespass on Scientology property or violate the law, but will report to police supervisors and not representatives of the Church of Scientology.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' {{debut album}} had an outsized effect {{relative}} to its modest sales. According to Generation X bassist Tony James, [...] "Everybody went up three gears the day <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally {{down to the}} Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] The Ramones' two July 1976 shows, like their debut album, are seen as having {{a significant impact on}} the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it, [...] "instantly nearly every band speeded up". The Ramones' first British concert, at London's Roundhouse concert hall, was held on July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial. The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening, supported by the Clash, making their public debut. The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): [...] "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play. Just get out there and do it.'" [...] Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform, the Damned, played their first show two days later. The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene, Sniffin' Glue, was named after the song [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", which appeared on the debut LP.|$|E

500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that</b> burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn!

2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>that,</b> then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that. Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E

5000|$|In November 2007, several ongoing {{titles and}} mini-series were branded as tie-ins {{to the main}} Secret Invasion storyline, with the tagline: Secret Invasion: The Infiltration. In {{addition}} to the core story, the Avengers titles provided additional plot material and acted as a link between titles. Other Marvel titles also featured variant covers with the characters depicted as Skrulls. Bendis stated that the series would not deal with {{the origins of the}} invasion, but is conceived from the following perspective: [...] "If there's a character on the team who's a Skrull, we will rewind from when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> on <b>that</b> team, or from before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> on <b>that</b> team, so when they are infiltrated, how they became who they became and the effects of their actions from their 'point of view' is shown." ...|$|R

60|$|To be sure, {{when her}} boy was gone, Madam Esmond forgot {{all these little}} tiffs and differences.

These gone, Madam fell {{naturally}} upon Mrs. Mountain and her little daughter, and worried and annoyed them. But women bear with hard words more easily than men, are more ready to forgive injuries, or, perhaps, to dissemble anger. Let us trust that Madam Esmond's dependants found their life tolerable, that they gave her ladyship sometimes as good as <b>they</b> <b>got,</b> <b>that</b> if they quarrelled in the morning they were reconciled at night, and sate down to a tolerably friendly game at cards and an amicable dish of tea.|$|E

Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea, already vivid and concrete enough, became now realistic in the highest degree. She figured that pleasant young man lecturing in the most edifying way to his students, herself modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and helper; she figured a refined little home, with two bureaus, with white shelves of high-class books, and autotypes of the pictures of Rossetti and Burne Jones, with Morris's wall-papers and flowers in pots of beaten copper. Indeed she figured many things. On the Pincio the two had a few precious moments together, while Helen marched Fanny off to see the muro Torto, and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped their friendship was only beginning, that he already found her company very precious to him, that indeed it was more than that.|$|E

The road was rougher than the roads at home; but for much less money they had the comfort, without the unavailing splendor, of a Pullman in their second-class carriage. Mrs. March had expected to be used with the severity on the imperial railroads which she had failed to experience from the military on the Hamburg sidewalks, but nothing could be kindlier than the whole management toward her. Her fellow-travellers were not lavish of their rights, as Americans are; what <b>they</b> <b>got,</b> <b>that</b> they kept; and in the run from Hamburg to Leipsic she had several occasions to observe that no German, however young or robust, dreams of offering a better place, if he has one, to a lady in grace to her sex or age; if they got into a carriage too late to secure a forward-looking seat, she rode backward to the end of that stage. But if they appealed to their fellow-travellers for information about changes, or stops, or any of the little facts that they wished to make sure of, they were enlightened past possibility of error. At the point where they might have gone wrong the explanations were renewed with a thoughtfulness which showed that their anxieties had not been forgotten.
