Even without taking into account <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> inherent constitutional authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance, we think the procedures and government showings required under FISA, if they do not meet the minimum Fourth Amendment warrant standards, certainly come close. We, therefore, believe firmly, applying the balancing test drawn from Keith, that FISA as amended is constitutional because the surveillances it authorizes are reasonable.|$|R

50|$|Title V {{explains}} the process a state must follow to request that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> declare an emergency. Every request for <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to declare an emergency {{must come from}} {{the governor of the}} state. In order for a request to be made, the Governor must deem that the situation is beyond the potential for the state to manage. To do this, the Governor must begin execution of the state's emergency plan and detail the types and amount of federal aid that will be required. Upon receiving this information <b>the</b> <b>President</b> can then decide if the situation qualifies as an emergency. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to declare an emergency without the Governor's request if <b>the</b> <b>President</b> determines that <b>the</b> emergency falls within the primary responsibility of the United States exclusive or preeminent responsibility as governed by the United States Constitution or laws.|$|R

Empowered by the public's apparent vote of confidence in his administration, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program. The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, [...] "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program." [...] Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But {{for the first time the}} federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and the handicapped. Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act only applied to roughly sixty percent of the labor force, as farmers, domestic workers, and other groups were excluded.|$|R

50|$|Hamilton {{explains}} that the Presidential power to veto is limited, {{as opposed to the}} King of England’s power to overturn an act of the legislature absolutely. The authority given to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to be able to veto is beyond significant in the construction and evolution of the country. However, <b>the</b> limitations that <b>President</b> <b>has</b> with this authority is also crucial in how the country is run. While <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to veto something he may not agree with, the legislature is permitted to neglect the decision of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> (if it’s seen unfit), and proceed with a 2/3 vote on the bill. He discusses how there does leave “wiggle room” for a righteous law to be passed, as opposed to the King of England, who has the power to upfront, decline the passing of the bill and the procession ends there. As a result, Hamilton contrasts between the limitations on the United States Executive veto and the King of England’s absolute power to veto a legislative act.|$|R
