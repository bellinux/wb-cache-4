An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of room temperature, door opening, thermostat setting position, relative humidity, and loading on energy consumption of a household refrigerator-freezer. With the experimental data, a multiple regression equation is developed to investigate their combined effect.

40|$|The {{blast wave}} emanating from an {{explosion}} produces an almost instantaneous rise in pressure which can then cause Blast Overpressure (BOP) injuries to nearby persons. BOP injury criteria are specified in <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> to relate BOP measurements in a testing environment to {{a risk of}} BOP injury. This study considered the adequacy of <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> in evaluating BOP protection concepts for the torso. Four potential BOP injury scenarios were studied to determine the likelihood of injury and the adequacy of <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> for appropriate protection concepts. In the case of vehicle blast, BOP injury is unlikely and <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are adequate. In the scenario involving an explosive charge detonated within a vehicle, and the close proximity to a hand grenade scenario, <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are not available. The demining scenario was identified as of importance as <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> are available, but do not mandate the evaluation of BOP protection. A prototype South African Torso Surrogate (SATS) was developed to explore this scenario further. The SATS was required to be relatively inexpensive and robust. The SATS was cast from silicone (selected to represent body tissue characteristics) using a torso mould containing a steel frame and instrumented with chest face-on pressure transducer and accelerometer. The SATS was subjected to an Anti-Personnel (AP) mine test and the Chest Wall Velocity Predictor and Viscous Criterion were used to predict that BOP injuries would occur in a typical demining scenario. This result was confirmed by applying the injury criteria to empirical blast predictions from the Blast Effects Calculator Version 4 (BECV 4). Although limitations exist {{in the ability of}} injury criteria and measurement methods to accurately predict BOP injuries, generally a conservative approach should be taken. Thus, it is recommended that the risk of BOP injuries should be evaluated in demining personal protective equipment <b>test</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is presented}} {{of the space}} radiation environment {{and its effects on}} electrical, electronic, and electromechanical parts. Relevant <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> and guidelines are listed. Test standards and guidelines are necessary to ensure best practices, minimize and bound systematic and random errors, and to ensure comparable results from different testers and vendors. Test standards are by their nature static but exist in a dynamic environment of advancing technology and radiation effects research. New technologies, failure mechanisms, and advancement in our understanding of known failure mechanisms drive the revision or development of <b>test</b> <b>standards.</b> Changes to standards must be weighed against their impact on cost and existing part qualifications. There must be consensus on new best practices. The complexity of some new technologies exceeds the scope of existing <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> and may require development of a guideline specific to the technology. Examples are given to illuminate the value and limitations of key radiation <b>test</b> <b>standards</b> as well as the challenges in keeping these standards up to date...|$|R

ASTM subcommittee E 35. 17 has been active in the vertebrate pesticide field since 1974, developing <b>testing</b> <b>standards</b> for birds, rodents, and predators. The standards that have been developed are diverse and, because of a perceived need by many subcom- mittee members, have broken new ground for ASTM. For example, the subcommittee developed standards for the use of strychnine on birds and of 1080 on predators, primarily because no standards or use directions existed in published format.
