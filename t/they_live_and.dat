5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> work in Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 {{just ahead of the}} Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E
5|$|Phasianidae {{consists}} of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump with broad relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans. Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from {{the underside of the}} beak and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak called a snood. As with many galliform species, the female (the hen) is smaller and much less colorful than the male (the tom). With wingspans of , the turkeys are the largest birds in the open forests in which <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> are rarely mistaken for any other species. Grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In all of Maryland's species, males are polygamous and have elaborate courtship displays. These heavily built birds have legs feathered to the toes. Most species are year-round residents and do not migrate. Four species of Phasianidae have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

Rashad is a talented artist but does not see much of a future in that field as he has become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where <b>they</b> <b>live,</b> <b>and</b> is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year.

25|$|School {{districts are}} rarely {{precisely}} coextensive with the cities, towns, villages, or hamlets that bear the same name, meaning {{that a person}} living in one hamlet or village might {{send their children to}} a school associated with a different hamlet or village. Residents pay school taxes to the same school district in which <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> any children living with them attend school.

25|$|In the United States, housing {{inequality}} {{is often}} relative to racial discrimination {{and differences in}} wealth. Banks and other mortgage lenders evaluate people according to where <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> their credit rating. In a capitalist country such as USA companies lend money to home buyers {{for the purpose of}} making a profit from interest on the loan. In China, racial issues are less important because the population is mostly Chinese. Instead the fast changing economy in China has led to investors taking advantage of outdated and incomplete real estate legislation. The ensuing real estate bubble which priced many genuine home buyers out of the market has been addressed by placing a heavy tax on homes resold within 3 months of purchase.|$|E

25|$|Motivation may {{contribute}} to the placebo effect. The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning is derived from the culture in which <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment. Research into the placebo treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers shows that this varies widely with society. The placebo effect in treating gastric ulcers is low in Brazil, higher in northern Europe (Denmark, Netherlands), and extremely high in Germany. However, the placebo effect in treating hypertension is lower in Germany than elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{some species}} of anglerfish, when a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and {{releases}} an enzyme that digests {{the skin of}} his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. <b>They</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1980, Englewood {{switched}} from a Mayor-Council {{form of government}} to a modified Council-Manager plan of government in accordance with a Special Charter granted by the New Jersey Legislature. Under this charter, the mayor retains appointive and veto powers, while the council acts as a legislative and policy making body, with some power to appoint and confirm appointments. The City Council consists of five members, each elected for a three-year term. Four are elected from the individual wards in which <b>they</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> the other is elected by a citywide vote as an at-large member. The city is divided into four wards which are approximately equal in population. Administrative functions are responsibilities of the City Manager. The six seats in the governing body are elected in a three-year cycle {{as part of the}} November general election, with wards two and four both up together, followed a year later by wards one and three, and then the at-large council and mayoral seats. Each ward votes in two of the three years in the cycle, once for its ward seat, in the other year for the two positions voted at-large and one year with no election.|$|E
