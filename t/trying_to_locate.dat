5|$|At 19:00, {{two local}} men spotted Sabina whilst walking a dog on Christchurch Street, Fenton. One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The other man was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> her hospitalised sister.|$|E

5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Billie {{tells the}} Halliwells {{her older sister}} Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) was kidnapped by a demon 15 years prior. Billie's {{memories}} are rekindled when she is finding {{the location of a}} demon named Dogan (Eric Steinberg) and recognizes similarities between him and Christy's kidnapper. After this revelation, Billie's storylines focus on her search for her sister; the Halliwells worry about Billie becoming obsessed with finding Christy as she takes more risks to get information, such as interrogating and torturing demons. Billie accuses her parents of choosing to forget Christy rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> her. Billie's mother Helen (Barbara Niven) gives her Christy's diary, in which Billie finds a pentagram on the last page. The pentagram is a symbol for the demonic council known as Triad (Steven J. Oliver, Seren Oliver, and Leland Crooke). She eventually gains enough control over her powers to travel to the past, speak to Christy, and find her location.|$|E

Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived creature is startled by light and escapes the lab, running into the woods. Later, as Frankenstein and Lavenza are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> the creature from her father's basement, Clerval is killed mysteriously while camping. The creature confronts Frankenstein and asks her {{to make him a}} friend. She grows morally opposed to the idea of recreating her experiment and agrees to run off to Costa Rica with Lavenza after he confesses his love to her.

25|$|On May 2012, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) {{released}} its final {{report on the}} investigation. It determined that a visual approach {{should not have been}} attempted due to low visibility. There was no checklist reading or crew briefing. The flight crew lacked situation awareness while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> the runway and while performing the go-around. The aircraft entered a rapid descent during the go-around due to a 38-degree left roll and crew commanded flap retraction from 15 to 0 degrees. Both crew members had low experience and flying time on type. The inadequacy and ineffectiveness of the training program may lead to actions that deviate from standard operating procedure and that regress to a previous aircraft type.|$|E

They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may turn out the lights in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E

25|$|The Dhakeshwari {{temple was}} built in the 12th century by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and many say the city was named after this temple.

It is considered an essential part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Many researchers say that the temple {{is also one of the}} Shakti Peethas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. Although there is not enough historical context to establish this as a fact, researchers were directed to this site while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> the particular Shakti Peetha. Since ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 800-year-old statue was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. There remains the replica of original idol in Dhaka. The temple was further damaged during the Muslim mob attacks of 1989–90.|$|E

Furthermore, he added that Paramount was responsible for creating one between the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, and he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> it, noting the difficulties related to obtaining the print as the studio no longer possesses an adequate capacity to deal with this matter and off-shore companies involved in the legal matters were now greatly reduced in staff and stated that is the reason why acquiring the film's print is a time-consuming process.|$|E
