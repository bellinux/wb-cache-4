5|$|In this Proposition, Newton derives the {{consequences}} of his theorem of revolving orbits in the limit of nearly circular orbits. This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth. This approximation also allows Newton <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> great variety of central force laws, not merely inverse-square and inverse-cube force laws.|$|E
5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts {{to negotiate with the}} Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either as part of the amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E

5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> multidimensional object such as {{a garden}} hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|After 1986, the Jewish Community of Zagreb began <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> Jewish {{cultural}} {{center and a}} memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silađin and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new Jewish center in Praška Street. Silađin's vision was ultimately not accepted by the Jewish community; instead, plans were being made {{for the construction of}} the {{cultural center}} and a synagogue, following an international architecture competition. However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government. The project was not developed.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, {{he worked}} in the woods, shoed horses, and drove heavy equipment. He met Emile Dupré in 1957, who told him <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> career in {{professional}} wrestling. Cormier began training, and later moved to Indianapolis, Indiana to continue his preparation under trainer Les Ruffen, and made his debut in 1963. At first, he used the ring name Pierre Lebelle before switching to Ivan the Lumberjack. In Texas, he was known as Joe Gump. When he later ventured to the Mid-Atlantic territory, Jim Crockett, Sr. named him The Beast. At that time, he had thick, untamed hair and a large, curly beard.|$|E

5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E

However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes. He did not have the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1843 Sam Houston's Texas {{administration}} had returned to negotiations with the Mexican government <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> rapprochement that would permit Texas self-governance, possibly as a state of Mexico, with Great Britain acting as mediator. Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E

He toured Europe with the orchestra, and shared the organization's trumpet chairs with Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones and Benny Bailey. This aided his musical development considerably, as did his 1953 membership of Teddy Charles' New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in this band allowed him <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> broader range of expression during improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Frears had {{a clause}} in his {{contract}} {{that allowed him}} to direct any sequels. The success of The Deal prompted the production team <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> new film—possibly surrounding Britain's commitment to the war in Iraq. In 2004, production was announced that the first follow-up would be produced for a theatrical film release in 2006, The Queen; that dramatises the weeks following the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997. Langan described the film as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.|$|E

The commune of Bavay, the Bellignies quarry (SECAB) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003. The CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois became the owner / operator of 85 percent of the site. The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental management scheme In 2009, the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site for a period of 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

5|$|Narayan {{travelled}} to Lahore in 1943 and {{auditioned for}} the local All India Radio (AIR) station as a singer, but the station's music producer, Jivan Lal Mattoo, noticed grooves in Narayan's fingernails: sarangis are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings, which strains the nails. Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a sarangi player. Traditionally, the sarangi is supposed to play after the singer and imitate the vocal performance, and play {{in the space between}} phrases. Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan, a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four ragas through singing lessons. Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>a</b> solo career.|$|E
