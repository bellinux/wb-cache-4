50|$|The EX-L {{and higher}} trims could be {{purchased}} with both navigation and rear entertainment systems, or rear entertainment system only, while the VHS-based i-VES system was dropped. Four trim levels {{were available in}} the United States: LX, EX, EX-L, and Touring, the top-of-the-line package in the Odyssey lineup that incorporated features such as run-flat tires, power tailgate, power adjustable pedals, multi information display, memory seats and chrome <b>tailgate</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|E
5000|$|XLT Lariat: Featured floor carpeting, color-keyed headliner, a {{standard}} chrome grille, and optional power windows/door locks. Woodgrain trim {{on the door}} panels was phased after the 1984 model year, as 1985-1986 models had a carpeted section applied to the door panels. For 1985 models, the <b>tailgate</b> <b>trim</b> was changed to a [...] "flat" [...] full width aluminum with a red [...] "reflector" [...] towards the bottom with chrome FORD letters.|$|E
2500|$|The Mariner (600 units) in Barbados Blue {{paint with}} body side panels and rear <b>tailgate</b> <b>trimmed</b> in {{simulated}} bleached teak wood planking accented by narrow black horizontal stripes and a [...] "nautical anchor" [...] medallion. The interior featured anchors and stars decorating dark blue suede bolster panels of the seats, which also had white piping and broad horizontal pleated inserts of medium blue antelope grain vinyl. The Mariner was sold along the coastal {{regions of the}} United States.|$|R
2500|$|The car was {{available}} {{only as an}} Avant, and was sold only in European markets. [...] Visual differences for the RS6 Plus included the [...] "black optic pack", which consisted of black finish to the framing of the radiator grille, exterior window <b>trims,</b> <b>tailgate</b> lower <b>trim,</b> roof rails, and exhaust tailpipes. [...] It quickly sold out once it was released (999 units total). [...] The last three digits of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) are reproduced on a plaque inside the car, displayed on the centre console.|$|R
5000|$|The Limited {{remains the}} top-of-the-line trim {{level for the}} Tucson.. It adds these {{features}} to the [...] "sporty" [...] Sport trim level: LED low-beam headlamps and tail lamps, a chrome grille and door handles, a [...] "Shark-Fin" [...] roof-mounted antenna, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a power passenger's seat, an eight-inch (8") touch-screen audio system (an A/M-F/M radio with HD Radio, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a single-disc CD/MP3 player, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, a full color touch-screen display, full voice command, Bluetooth for phone and audio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, as well as USB and iPod integration with 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, with GPS navigation), an 8-speaker premium audio system with external amplifier and subwoofer, a dual-zone automatic climate control system with CleanAir ionizer and automatic defogger, floor-mounted rear air and heat vents, premium door sill trim plates, premium interior surfaces (instrument panel, driver's console side panel, and door panels), the BlueLink telematics system, a HomeLink transmitter, an automatic-dimming rearview mirror with integrated compass, and a Limited emblem on the <b>tailgate.</b> The Limited <b>trim</b> level begins at $29,900.00, without options. This is significantly lower than some of its fully loaded competitors, like the Honda CR-V, and the Nissan Murano, {{both of which are}} priced in the low $30,000 range, when fully equipped.|$|R
5000|$|The Cortina was {{available}} with 1200 and (from early 1963) 1500 four-cylinder engines with all synchromesh gearbox, in two-door and four-door saloon, {{as well as}} in five-door estate (from March 1963) forms. Standard, Deluxe, Super, and GT trims were offered but not across all body styles. Early Standard models featured a simple body coloured front grille, earning it the nickname 'Ironbar'. Since this version cost almost the same as the better equipped Deluxe it sold poorly and is very rare today. Options included heater and bench seat with column gearchange. Super versions of the estates offered the option of simulated wood side and <b>tailgate</b> <b>trim.</b> In an early example of product placement many examples of the brand new Cortina featured as [...] "Glamcabs" [...] in the comedy film Carry On Cabby.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous changes {{occurred}} in 1971. First came another new grille design (the [...] "egg crate") for Chevrolet trucks and black paint over {{portions of the}} GMC grille. Second, an additional trim package was introduced: the Cheyenne. On GMC models, this {{was referred to as}} the Sierra. These packages consisted mostly of comfort features â€” nicer interiors, more padding and insulation, carpet, chrome trim, and upper and lower side molding and <b>tailgate</b> <b>trim.</b> 1971 was the first year for AM/FM radios factory installed. Finally, the front brakes on all light-duty trucks were switched from drum brakes to disc brakes, resulting in much less brake fade under heavy use. While prior C/K half-ton trucks had used a six-lug bolt pattern (6 x 5.5") for the wheels, two-wheel-drive models switched to a five-lug pattern (5 x 5-inch bolt circle) common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac passenger cars. The 1/2 ton 4 x 4 retained the 6 lug bolt pattern. This bolt pattern would remain the standard {{through the end of the}} C/K series (along with the Chevrolet/GMC vans). The 20 and 30-series trucks had the 8 x 6.5" [...] pattern. Also, Chevrolet changed the 396 V8 emblem designation to 400 V8.|$|E
