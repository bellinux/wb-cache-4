5|$|CygnusX-1 (abbreviated CygX-1) is a galactic X-ray {{source in}} the {{constellation}} Cygnus, and the first such source widely accepted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect who turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black,</b> mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E
50|$|Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult <b>is</b> <b>a</b> German-Polish <b>black</b> metal {{band from}} Dormagen. They <b>are</b> {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> traditional <b>black</b> metal band, {{and as such}} has been interviewed in 2006 by the Franco-German TV network Arte. Their lead singer is female, which is very rare among black metal bands.|$|R

25|$|Located near Eta Cygni is the X-ray source Cygnus X-1, {{which is}} now thought {{to be caused by}} a black hole accreting matter in a binary star system. This was the first x-ray source widely {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole.|$|E
25|$|A {{black bear}} shot in autumn 1986 in Michigan was thought by some <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> bear/grizzly bear hybrid, {{due to its}} unusually large size and its proportionately larger braincase and skull. DNA testing was unable to {{determine}} whether it was a large black bear or grizzly.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It <b>is</b> powered by <b>a</b> compact region at the core, thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> super-massive <b>black</b> hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|R

50|$|BG Geminorum <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{eclipsing binary}} star system in the {{constellation}} Gemini. It consists of a K0 supergiant with a more massive but unseen companion. The companion <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole or class B star. Material from the K0 star <b>is</b> being transferred <b>to</b> <b>an</b> accretion disk surrounding the unidentified object.|$|R
25|$|If the accretor in an X-ray binary has {{a minimum}} mass that {{significantly}} exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (the maximum possible mass for a neutron star), {{it is expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole. This {{is the case in}} Cygnus X-1, for example, where the radial velocity of the companion star has been measured.|$|E
25|$|The name Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1 (also {{known as}} the TMA-1) refers to the strong {{magnetic}} field found somewhere in the lunar Crater Tycho by an American scientific satellite. Astronauts find that this magnetic anomaly is caused by an alien monolith buried about 15 meters below the surface. When the monolith is excavated and examined, it is found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> cuboid whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (1² : 2² : 3²). However, in the novel, Clarke suggests that this sequence or ratio extends past the three known spatial dimensions into the much higher dimensions, like this: 16 : 25 : 36...|$|E
25|$|Michael Neill, {{editor of}} the Oxford Shakespeare edition, notes that the {{earliest}} critical references to Othello's colour, (Thomas Rymer's 1693 critique of the play, and the 1709 engraving in Nicholas Rowe's edition of Shakespeare), assume him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> man, while the earliest known North African interpretation was not until Edmund Kean's production of 1814. Honigmann questions the view that Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud ben Mohammed Anoun, Moorish ambassador of the Arab King of Barbary to Queen Elizabeth I in 1600, was one inspiration for Othello. He stayed with his retinue in London for several months and occasioned much discussion, and thus might have inspired Shakespeare's play, written {{only a few years}} afterwards. The exact date that Othello was written is unknown, though sources indicate that it was written between 1601 and 1610, sometime after the Moorish delegation.|$|E

5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river <b>was</b> noted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> malodorous, <b>black</b> sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|R
25|$|In X-ray {{binaries}}, {{the compact}} object {{can be either}} a neutron star or a black hole. These binaries are classified as low-mass or high-mass according to {{the mass of the}} donor star. High-mass X-ray binaries contain a young, early-type, high-mass donor star which transfers mass by its stellar wind, while low-mass X-ray binaries are semidetached binaries in which gas from a late-type donor star or a white dwarf overflows the Roche lobe and falls towards the neutron star or black hole. Probably the best known example of an X-ray binary is the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1. In Cygnus X-1, the mass of the unseen companion is estimated to be about nine times that of the Sun, far exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit for the maximum theoretical mass of a neutron star. It is therefore believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole; it was the first object for which this was widely believed.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hop–style NYC street scene. Because of the ambiguous nature of the record sleeve and the R groove of the song, Madonna was widely believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> artist when the single was released. According to Matthew Lindsay of The Quietus, it was ironic that the record sleeve did not depict Madonna on the cover, as she would become [...] "the face of the 80s." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou's goal, {{beginning}} {{with her first}} autobiography, was to [...] "tell {{the truth about the}} lives of black women", but her goal evolved, in her later volumes, to document {{the ups and downs of}} her own life. Angelou's autobiographies have the same structure: they give a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time, how she coped within the context of a larger white society, and the ways that her story played out within that context. Critic Selwyn Cudjoe stated that in Gather Together, Angelou is still concerned with the questions of what it means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> female in the US, but focuses upon herself at a certain point in history, in the years immediately following World War II. The book begins with a prologue describing the confusion and disillusionment of the African-American community during that time, which matched the alienated and fragmented nature of the main character's life. According to McPherson, African Americans were promised a new racial order that did not materialize.|$|E

Also similar to Power Girl, Cir-El wore gloves and boots, both black. Her uniform was topped {{off with a}} dark blue, knee-length cape. Instead of the traditional S-Shield, Cir-El instead sported a simple large red letter S that went {{down the length of}} her upper torso.|$|R
500|$|Angelou's {{original}} {{goal was}} {{to write about the}} lives of Black women in America, but her goal evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her own life. [...] Angelou's autobiographies had the same structure: a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time and how she coped within the context of a larger white society, as well as the ways that her story played out within that context. [...] Angelou, especially in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, successfully demonstrated the integrity of the African-American character as she experienced more positive interactions with whites. [...] In Angelou's second volume, Gather Together in My Name, Angelou was concerned with what it meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> female in the U.S., but she focused upon herself at a certain point in history. Writer Selwyn Cudjoe said regarding her second autobiography: [...] "It is almost as though the incidents in the text were simply 'gathered together' under the name of Maya Angelou." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1900 and 1904, Taylor was {{president}} of the National Negro Democratic League. Southern Democrats were enacting laws that disfranchised most Black voters and were imposing segregation through “Jim Crow” laws. Northern Democrats seemed unwilling and/or unable to control the excesses of their Southern parties. The National Negro Democratic League was fractured by the debate over the issue of linking the nation’s currency to silver as well as to gold. By 1904, Taylor was positioned to abandon the party and bureau that he had led as president for two terms. It was not a good time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> democrat. It also was a time when lynching was creeping northward and when scientific racism was gaining acceptance within the nation’s intellectual and scientific community. It was not a good time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> American.|$|E
