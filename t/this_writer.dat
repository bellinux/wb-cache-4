One summer, they noticed a cold draft of air blowing outward from some cracks here. They enlarged it, built some walls and were able to keep ice solid and perishable foods cold even in the summer heat, truly a luxury in the wilderness. The refrigerator is still there today (although partly fallen in) and, when measured by <b>this</b> <b>writer</b> in June 2003, was 2 degrees Celsius inside.|$|E

500|$|Rang De Basanti had a {{noticeable}} impact on Indian society. A study of bloggers behavioral patterns {{during the first}} month of the film's release revealed a significant increase in public ire towards government and politicians for constantly being mired in corruption and bureaucracy and their inefficiency in providing basic amenities. Intense political discussions spurred on by the film's influence were observed in these patterns. While commenting on <b>this,</b> <b>writer</b> D'Silva said that the film [...] "has struck a chord somewhere". Besides instigating political thought and discussions, it evoked social awakening for many. Some discussions rallied on how citizens should support and contribute to non-governmental organizations and exercising simple citizen duties of paying taxes and voting, while the others contemplated on how to become more responsible towards the country. Unlike other Indian films with jingoistic overtones, many young Indians could relate well to the characters of this film.|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of <b>this</b> <b>writer</b> to puzzle our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E
500|$|Kripke instead {{favored the}} [...] "unique and {{structurally}} interesting" [...] self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes {{arose from the}} writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that [...] "clowns in a context where they're {{not supposed to be}} are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology. This decision made the clown [...] "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to Supernatural, noting, [...] "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty back roads of rural America, and it's got great music." [...] However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent <b>this,</b> <b>writer</b> Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would [...] "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, {{after an}} account of Detzner's speech in Berlin to the Geographical Society was {{published}} in Australia, an angry Australian wrote anonymously {{to the editor of}} The Argus, a Melbourne newspaper, and described what he claimed were Detzner's lies. [...] "There [...] was [...] no [...] mystery [...] about [...] the [...] disappearance [...] of [...] Captain [...] Detzner [...] and [...] his [...] party", he claimed. [...] The writer attributed Detzner's success at staying ahead of the Australians to the perfidy of the German missionaries, who had agreed to remain neutral and in return for such agreement were allowed to continue their mission work. [...] Detzner was a civilian [...] surveyor, the writer claimed, not a soldier and he survived on mission station rations supplied by public subscription from the German plantation owners. [...] Furthermore, <b>this</b> <b>writer</b> asserted, Detzner's movements were so well known to the district officer at Morobe that he was prevented from escaping; they could have shot him several times, but did not. The writer dismissed Detzner's claims about Australian recruitment of the natives as [...] "in [...] keeping [...] with [...] his [...] dozens [...] of [...] other [...] lying [...] statements [...] in [...] all [...] cases [...] endeavoring [...] to [...] belittle [...] Englishmen [...] or [...] British [...] officers, [...] in [...] every [...] case [...] pure [...] fabrications [...] and [...] typical [...] scurrilous [...] Hun [...] lies".|$|E
500|$|Solo {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Andrew Liengard of Jazz Houston stated that Rubalcaba played [...] "at once a pyrotechnical and thunderous two-handed assault, he also demonstrates a profound awareness {{of space and}} dynamics," [...] and finally called the album [...] "stunning". Joey Guerra of Amazon said that Solo [...] "finds Rubalcaba soaring {{on the strength of}} his own talent", creating a [...] "unique experience." [...] Website Allmusic stated that the album is a spellbinding collection of improvisations with [...] "remarkable stylistic display." [...] Harvey Siders of JazzTimes commented that the album did not need elaborate arrangements, being a [...] "spontaneous inner dialogue from a brilliant inquisitive mind" [...] and that on Solo [...] "elegance trumps excitement." [...] PopMatters Robert R. Calder stated that the record was [...] "a very remarkable solo piano recital." [...] David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer [...] "is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work." [...] Miller also suggested that [...] "Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings. He still has time to become a great solo artist, and <b>this</b> <b>writer</b> has every confidence that he will." [...] In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba [...] "finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait for this moment, and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately he lights an inspiring fire." [...] Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdés, asseverating that both performers [...] "blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction." [...] Timothy Sprinkle of Jazz Review declared that the performer [...] "carries the disc with a light, breezy ease that's surprising, especially given all of the slow selections." ...|$|E

"To these {{accounts}} may be added that of Nicolaus Damascenus. <b>This</b> <b>writer</b> states that at Antioch, near Daphne, {{he met with}} ambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Caesar. It appeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but three only survived, whom he says he saw. The rest had died chiefly in consequence {{of the length of}} the journey. The letter was written in Greek upon a skin; the import of it was, that Porus was the writer, that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; {{that he was willing to}} allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just. Eight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge larger than a vulture. They were accompanied by the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case with this man. For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre.
