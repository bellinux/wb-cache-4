He then went to Martínez' shop <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> teenager was dead. She told Garza {{that she would not}} give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work.

25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission.

500|$|Though Elizabeth {{followed}} a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. [...] "She {{is only a}} woman, only mistress of half an island," [...] marvelled Pope Sixtus V, [...] "and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all". Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as Christendom fragmented. Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. She therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> truth—a style of government that her Stuart successors failed to follow. Some historians have called her lucky; she believed that God was protecting her. Priding herself on being [...] "mere English", Elizabeth trusted in God, honest advice, {{and the love of}} her subjects for the success of her rule.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was {{directed}} by the American photographer Herb Ritts, and shot at Key Biscayne in Miami, Florida {{in the last week}} of January 2001.

According to Ritts, the singer [...] "wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, and that meant that it boiled down to her.

[...] He also revealed that the video was set at [...] "a funky beach shack" [...] similar to the videos for Madonna's [...] "Cherish" [...] (1989) and Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1989). [...] "The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>the</b> words", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, [...] "was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model," [...] according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material.
