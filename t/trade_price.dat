5000|$|Fair Trade {{organizations}} {{promote a}} trade {{environment in which}} the coffee importer has a direct relationship with the coffee producer, excluding the middlemen. Coffee importers provide credit to certified farmers to help them stay out of debt with coffee traders so they can develop long-lasting trade relationships. Producer organizations are paid a floor price (Fairtrade Minimum Price) of US$125 cents per pound for Fairtrade certified washed Arabica and US$120 cents for unwashed Arabica, or the market price, if higher. The free <b>trade</b> <b>price</b> of coffee rose above this minimum in September 2007, but due to recent economic events, the free <b>trade</b> <b>price</b> dropped back below this minimum in October 2008. The fair <b>trade</b> <b>price</b> for (conventional natural robusta) coffee has been $1.01 since June 2008 [...] The price of conventional commodity coffee was also over $1 in 2008, but about $0.70 in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Asset exchanges, such as {{mergers and}} acquisitions, {{typically}} {{give rise to}} abnormal returns. This dissertation tests a fads hypothesis for abnormal returns on initial public offerings, an asset exchange in which traders exchange cash for issuers' new shares. Initial public offerings, or IPOs, exhibit positive abnormal returns on {{the date of the}} exchange when <b>trading</b> <b>prices,</b> on average, rise above offering prices. IPOs also exhibit negative abnormal returns after the exchange as <b>trading</b> <b>prices,</b> on average, fall relative to those on comparable-risk assets. In the fads hypothesis, IPOs occur when a fad, or mass psychogical movement, induces traders to bid the <b>trading</b> <b>prices</b> of certain types of assets up over their intrinsic <b>prices.</b> These high <b>trading</b> <b>prices</b> offer a quasi-arbitrage opportunity that motivates unaffected traders to short-sell seasoned shares affected by the fad or issue new shares based on like assets. For the fads hypothesis to explain abnormal returns on IPOs, fads among traders must allow price bubbles to persist long enough for rational traders to issue IPOs, and rational traders must actually do so. This dissertation's experimental spot asset double auction markets show that the duration of price booms, or rising differences between <b>trading</b> <b>prices</b> and intrinsic prices, significantly increases with an increase in asset life, suggesting that differences between <b>trading</b> <b>prices</b> and intrinsic prices can persist. This laboratory finding parallels field findings that closed-end fund <b>trading</b> <b>prices</b> only converge to net asset values (an intrinsic price proxy) when secondary trading ceases due to merger, liquidation or open-ending. This finding is consistent with bubbles persisting long enough for quasi-arbitrage responses. This dissertation also shows that an apparent fad in closed-end country funds led issuers and underwriters to organize an extraordinary number of IPOs in late 1989 and early 1990. These issuers profited by promising to purchase assets at net asset values and selling shares based on that promise at a premium. The shares issued during this apparent fad had positive abnormal returns in their initial rise from offering <b>prices</b> to <b>trading</b> <b>prices,</b> and subsequently had negative abnormal returns as their premium <b>trading</b> <b>prices</b> fell to discounts. This closed-end country fund findings are consistent with the fads hypothesis of abnormal returns on IPO asset exchanges...|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} {{enterprises}} {{have begun to}} pay attention to their carbon footprint in the supply chain, of which transportation has become the second major source of carbon emissions. This paper aims to study both optimum pricing and order quantities, considering consumer demand and the selection of transportation modes by retailers, in terms of carbon emissions sensitivity and price sensitivity under the conditions of a cap-and-trade policy and uncertain market demand. Firstly, we analyze the effects of transportation mode (including transportation costs and transportation-induced carbon emissions), initial emissions allowances, carbon emissions <b>trading</b> <b>price</b> and consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions on the optimum decisions and profits of retailers. The results demonstrate that when consumers are less sensitive to price, the optimum retail price and the optimum order quantity of products are proportional to the transportation cost and transportation-induced carbon emissions of retailers per unit product, the carbon emissions <b>trading</b> <b>price</b> as well as consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions. However, when consumers are highly sensitive to price, the optimum order quantity of products is inversely proportional to the transportation costs and transportation-induced carbon emissions of retailers per unit product, the carbon emissions <b>trading</b> <b>price</b> and consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions. In addition, the optimum retail price of products is inversely proportional to consumer sensitivity to carbon emissions. We also find that retailers prefer a low-carbon transportation mode when the carbon emissions <b>trading</b> <b>price</b> is high. Meanwhile, the carbon emissions <b>trading</b> <b>price</b> influences the carbon emissions trading volume of retailers. These theoretical findings are further validated by some numerical analysis...|$|R
