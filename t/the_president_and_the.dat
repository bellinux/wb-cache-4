In October, Chief Justice Chaudry {{met with}} his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{intention}} of legislation concerning the elected President that the initiative to refer the question to the Tribunal should lie with the Government, and generally not with the President whose recourse was in vetoing the legislation. The Cabinet would advise <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> matter would then be referred to the Tribunal.|$|E

5|$|Singapore has a multi-party {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy {{in which the}} President of Singapore {{is the head of}} state and the Prime Minister of Singapore is the head of government. Executive power is vested in <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet. Cabinet has the general direction and control of the government and is collectively responsible to the Parliament. There are three separate branches of government: the legislature, executive and judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean Civil War (1891), {{rather than}} calming the naval ambitions of Chile, {{escalated}} them. In that conflict, the Chilean Navy {{played a significant}} role on the congressional side against <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> army. The resulting victory of the congressional side and subsequent presidency of Admiral Jorge Montt led to a large increase in prestige and consequent funding for the navy. Argentine naval units assisted failed revolts in Argentina, but the continuing acrimony with and naval acquisitions of Chile meant this had little effect.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore {{uses the}} word Government to mean the Executive branch, made up of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet.

5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with different aspects of governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy. The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service. To qualify as a presidential candidate, stringent criteria must be satisfied.|$|E
5|$|The Legislature of Singapore {{consists}} of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Parliament. The concept of representative democracy is {{embodied in the}} Legislature and is given effect in part through various parliamentary innovations that have been introduced over the years, such as Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament and Nominated Members of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{government}} systems in European politics: in a presidential system, the president {{is the head of}} state and the head of government; in a semi-presidential system, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prime minister share a number of competences; finally, in a parliamentary republic, the president is a ceremonial figurehead who has few political competences. As with the definition of constitutional monarchies, sometimes the president does have non-ceremonial competences, but does not use them by constitutional convention; this is the case in Austria, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{subjective}} test applied in Karam Singh and Lee Mau Seng, {{the exercise of}} discretion by <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA is not open to review. The court cannot enquire about the grounds and the facts justifying the executive's decision. In contrast, under the objective test, the exercise of discretion is reviewable by {{a court of law}} and the executive has to satisfy the court that there are objective facts justifying the executive's decision.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} must be {{made under}} the hand of (that is, signed by) the President, and must be served on the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is required to assist the Tribunal in the hearing of the reference, and the President may be represented by such legal counsel as the Tribunal may appoint, after consulting the President. The parties appearing before the Tribunal are not confined to <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Attorney-General. The Tribunal may direct that the hearing of a reference be notified to any interested person or, where there is an interested class of persons, {{to one or more}} representatives of the class. If there is any interest that is affected which is not represented by counsel, the Tribunal may request that counsel argue the case for this interest.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was inaugurated}} as {{president}} of Jefferson College on September 27, 1845. During his tenure, he also pastored a church {{in the city of}} Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. College administration apparently did not suit him, however. A student uprising against <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> faculty occurred in 1846, hastening the end of his short stay at the school. A desire to see his children, most of whom were living with relatives scattered throughout Kentucky and Virginia, also factored into his decision to resign his post in 1847. On his resignation, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the school.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} French civil law and Chadian {{customary}} law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Council, have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court {{is made up of}} a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any precedent fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated. On the facts of the case, the discretion conferred on <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the precedent fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with the bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of the bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of the bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, StojanoviÄ‡ {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced StojanoviÄ‡ to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, IliÄ‡ and StojanoviÄ‡ became, respectively, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats.
