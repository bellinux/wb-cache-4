40|$|Urban {{farming and}} food Cue: Urban {{agriculture}} - the {{growing of crops}} and keeping of livestock in cities ? is increasingly popular {{in many parts of}} Africa, both as a means for generating income, and as a way for urban households to supplement their diets. However, one challenge facing urban farming is how to access water for irrigation. While some families may harvest rainwater from their rooftops, many urban farmers depend on less clean sources of water, including polluted rivers and drainage channels. This creates a danger to health, both for the farmers themselves, who risk catching infections from the water, and for consumers who buy their produce. So how can consumers protect themselves, {{and what can be done}} to ensure that produce grown in urban areas is as safe as possible? To find out, Eric Kadenge went to a restaurant owned by food safety expert Mr Ham Onsando. Apart from his restaurant business, Mr Onsando also works for Global Food Safety, an organisation which helps restaurants and food processors to improve their safety standards. He began by explaining the risk to food safety from the use of contaminated irrigation water. IN:		?There is a very interesting situation ? OUT:		? Thank you very much. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ham Onsando, of the organisation Global Food Safety, talking to Eric Kadenge. Transcript Onsando	There is a very interesting situation that we find ourselves, especially in Nairobi and the urban setting. You have got your domestic shambas (gardens), you have got people who grow food by riversides, by drainage systems. A lot of these obviously have an element of risk. More so when we know that a lot of the effluent that leaves our houses finds its way into these rivers, into the drainage system on the way out. If you go into the industrial area, a lot of organizations there are pumping chemicals into these same scenarios that then end up possibly contaminating the produce that we get from these farmers. Kadenge	It is actually quite scary especially during the days when it?s very rainy because you will find that the sewage water and all the other rain water gets mixed up. Onsando	I have got a classic example of one. On my way home I always drive by him, he?s got a little sukuma wiki (kales) patch, and I know he gets his water from the drainage that runs by the little patch. There are issues in terms of what contaminants he is actually transferring on to the produce. The produce looks good, but you have then got to be aware of ? because of where it is grown - there is a risk and because of that risk there are ways you have got to address it. So you have got to cook it thoroughly, make sure you wash it thoroughly etc. So the steps to actually secure your own safety in terms of the consumer are easy to achieve. It is just washing thoroughly and then cooking thoroughly. That would normally get rid of the kind of contaminants we are dealing with in the urban area. But in that backdrop as well, we have got a mushrooming up of more informal eating areas as well. Nowadays you walk down the street and you can buy fruit salad ready to eat. You don?t know where the fruits have been washed, you don?t know whether the guy washed his hands before peeling the fruit, before chopping; we know so little about the food we are eating. Kadenge	And how do you think then that some of these risks could be minimized or prevented especially from the farmer?s perspective? Onsando	One of the biggest things we need is legislation. Legislation in the sense that farmers who draw water from rivers or from bore-holes have a right to know what kind of pollutants could have gotten into that water. Now legislation on industries, big industry players, we need legislation that will control what they can spew out into rivers. We need legislation that controls what pesticides farmers can use and in what quantities. Kadenge	Let?s talk about the consumer. How should I as a consumer get to know about these risks? Onsando	Education on food risks when you are eating is very key. But from my perspective any time you eat in a restaurant ? even if you have the slightest discomfort, four hours, three hours after eating, complain. Go back to that restaurant and complain. Say they caused you to have a sleepless night, they caused you to have diarrhea ? complain. Consumers have to be aware of their rights and I think the media has a role to play in that and maybe we should be running more consumer awareness programs and inviting people to tell the consumer what is his right as a consumer. Kadenge	And lastly then, what word would you have in regards to the contamination of water that is used for irrigation in urban settings like Nairobi? Onsando	Other than touting a lot for legislation, I would also like to ask the industry players, <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> actually spewing out a lot of waste water into our ecosystem. They should actually take it upon themselves and they should ask themselves ?Is what I am doing good for the environment?? Because ultimately, they might think that they will drive home in their big cars and go into their posh neighbourhoods and it will not affect them. But ultimately whatever we do to the environment affects us. Nature has got a nasty way of coming right round back and hitting at us. Kadenge	Okay thank you very much for taking your time to talk to us. Is this my cup of tea? Onsando	Yes, enjoy your cup of tea, it is very safe - purified water! Kadenge	Thank you very much. End of track.

40|$|Garlic - a {{powerful}} plant Cue: In European folk stories, garlic is perhaps {{known for its}} power to keep away vampires - the fictional creatures that live by drinking human blood. But the reputation of garlic for protecting humans from harm {{is not just a}} story. In fact the power of garlic to help the body to fight infections is well known, and some people eat garlic as an alternative medicine to treat fevers. Originating from Europe, China and Japan, garlic is widely used as a flavouring in European and Asian cooking. It?s also becoming more popular in African cooking, and the future for garlic farmers selling to local markets in Africa would seem to be bright. The power of garlic to repel pests is not just a folk tale either. Garlic plants act as a repellent to many insect pests, and if grown among other vegetable crops, such as tomatoes, garlic can help to protect all the plants from insect attack. Once harvested, the garlic bulbs - each one made from many smaller sections called cloves - can be stored in a well ventilated place for up to a year without losing their value. Canisius Mpala is a garlic farmer from Zimbabwe. He spoke to Busani Bafana about his experience of growing this powerful, high value crop. Busani began by asking him why he decided to grow garlic. IN:		?I saw the crop being grown at home? OUT:		? it is an easy crop to grow and the returns are very good. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Canisius Mpala, a garlic farmer from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Transcript Mpala	I saw the crop being grown at home in the Lukosi irrigation scheme in Hwange. Then I decided to experiment on the crop because I was told that it was easy to grow. I tried it and then after harvesting I realised that it was an easy crop to grow, it had a good market. So I decided to retain most of the seed, I sold a bit, so that the following year I went into it and grew it on a much larger area. Bafana	What would you say are the necessary conditions for the cultivation of garlic? Mpala	It is a cold season crop which requires chilling. So you can only grow it in the winter months. So in the winter months you have to plough your land, put in your manure, mix it with your soil. After that you put rows which are about 20 cms apart. Then in between the plants, you need to plant it about 5 cms apart. And then from there the only thing {{you have to do is}} to weed. And once in a while you can use a bit of pesticide just to prevent some diseases, but otherwise it is an easy crop. Even without any chemicals you can grow it as long as you do some irrigation since it is grown in winter. You have to plant it in March. It will be ready by July/August for harvesting. Bafana	You sound very passionate about growing garlic. Are there any difficulties in growing garlic? Mpala	Usually I tell people that garlic is an easy crop to grow because it is not attacked by any pests. It is actually a repellent. When the guys in Hwange started it was on the IPM workshop, whereby they wanted to find out which crop would they grow with their tomatoes in order to reduce the amount of pesticides that they were using. So they did a crop of garlic and tomatoes, and tomatoes alone and garlic alone, and then looked at the yields. So from there most of those guys in Hwange have now sort of resorted to taking garlic as the major crop. So it is an easy crop to grow, you just need a bit of water in winter and then even the fertilisation, once you do your composting in manure that is ideal for the crop. Bafana	What would you say was the biggest challenge you faced when you went into garlic growing? Mpala	The biggest challenge was the availability of cloves and the availability of the proper seed, because there are two varieties. There is the pink garlic and there is the white garlic. The pink garlic, most of the guys say this is more pungent and most people like it but it is not favourable for export. The white garlic is easy to handle and it is favourable for export but the seed was not available or it is not readily available. I think that has been the biggest challenge, getting the right material for seed. Bafana		Is it also easy to find the market for garlic? Mpala	Locally it has been easy, I think because most of the big wholesalers, the fruit and vegetable sellers they take up the garlic. And many people are learning or getting to use garlic on a regular basis so that marketing of the garlic has not been a problem. Bafana	You talked about white garlic and the pink garlic. When you grow the garlic do you sell it as processed or do you sell it raw? Mpala	Right now the pink garlic that we are growing, we are selling it as raw garlic. You just have to remove the leaves, remove the roots, package it into 10 kg pockets, sell it to Interfresh or the vegetable wholesalers. The white garlic that is for export has bigger cloves. It is easy to process and the South African market want it crushed as puree. Therefore this will be semi-processed, that will be sold to the outside market. Bafana	As a passionate farmer no doubt, what is the future of garlic growing in Zimbabwe as far as you can see? Mpala	The future of garlic growing is very bright. The past years or the past decade it was associated with the people of Asian decent or the whites. Those are the people who were eating garlic. But right now most people are taking up garlic because of its medicinal effect and most people use it as an antibiotic. So most people are taking up garlic and so the demand is increasing. So I think the prospects are brighter. And then there is also the prospect of selling it across the borders. Most countries the demand for garlic is high, therefore there is going to be a ready market and to grow. Bafana	For a farmer who might be interested definitely to go into garlic growing, what would be your advice? Mpala	My advice is tell the farmer to get in touch with the extension services, find out who are <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> already growing garlic, if they want to be assisted. And last year at the farm we had about 15 people coming, even though I was not around my supervisor showed them on how to grow it. When it was harvesting time the people came back again and said ?OK, how do we harvest the garlic?? So I think there is quite a lot of extension that might be needed for people. But looking at the ease at which you can grow garlic, it might have a bit of labour on planting but it is an easy crop to grow and the returns are very good. End of track.

Sathru {{is on the}} mission {{to win over the}} brothers to marry Devi. KD & Co organizes a cultural show in which Sangeeta (Laya) participates as a singer. The foolishness of KD & Co makes Sangeeta stay for four extra in Hanuman Junction, which lands her in a soup. When Sangeeta attempts suicide, Dasu and Krishna rescues her and brings her to their house.|$|R
