5|$|Sleaford Urban District Council {{was granted}} a coat of arms on 26 October 1950 and after it was {{abolished}} <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> were used by its successor, Sleaford Town Council. <b>The</b> <b>arms</b> are blazoned: Gules on a Chevron Or three Estoiles Sable on a Chief Argent as many Trefoils slipped Vert. The trefoils in the chief are from <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of the Marquess or Bristol, while the lower portion of the shield is <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of the Carre family. Its crest is blazoned: On a Wreath of the Colours an Eagle wings extended and head downwards and to the sinister proper holding in the beak an Ear of Wheat stalked and leaved Or, the eagle symbolises Sleaford's links with the Royal Air Force and the ear of wheat represents agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} {{was unusually}} complex for the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings. The first quarter consists of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of his father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms with an escutcheon of De Clare quartering Despenser (<b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of his wife Isabel le Despenser), which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second quarter showed <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of the Montacutes (quartered with the Monthermer arms). The third quarter showed <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arms</b> {{are used}} as a mark of {{authority}} by various government agencies and representatives, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Speaker of the House of Commons, most courts (including the Supreme Court), and, formerly, Parliament, and {{on the cover of}} Canadian passports. Since 1962, a banner of <b>the</b> <b>arms,</b> defaced with a variant of the Queen's cypher, has formed the Royal Standard of Canada, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal flag of the Governor General has featured the crest of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of Canada on a blue background since 1981.|$|E

5|$|As Duke of York, George's {{arms were}} the royal arms, with an inescutcheon of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of Saxony, all differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure. As Prince of Wales the centre label lost its anchor. As King, he bore the royal arms. In 1917, he removed, by warrant, the Saxony inescutcheon from <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of all male-line {{descendants}} of the Prince Consort domiciled in the United Kingdom (although the royal arms themselves had never borne the shield).|$|E
5|$|As Prince of Wales, George Augustus {{bore the}} royal arms (with an inescutcheon of Gules plain in the Hanoverian quarter), differenced by a label of three points Argent. <b>The</b> <b>arms</b> {{included}} the royal crest and supporters {{but with the}} single arched coronet of his rank, all charged on the shoulder with a similar label. His arms followed {{the change in the}} royal arms in 1801, when the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon and the French quarter was dropped altogether. The 1816 alteration did not affect him as it only applied to <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of the King.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as is found in <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union of the Crowns of England, Ireland and Scotland in 1603, the Royal Banner of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of {{the kings}} of Scotland was {{incorporated}} into the royal standards of successive Scottish then, following the Acts of Union in 1707, British monarchs; with all such royal standards being quartered to include the banner of <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of each individual realm.

The agreement signed during 2009 tied Cardiff Blues to a 20-year contract to play a maximum of 18 games per season for a set fee, rather than per match at Cardiff City Stadium. But on 23 February, it was announced that the two Welsh 'derbies' against the Scarlets and the Ospreys would be played at Cardiff City Stadium, rather than <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> Park, because of Cardiff Blues' anticipation that the attendance figures would far exceed the maximum capacity of 9,000. On 8 May 2012, it was announced that Cardiff Blues would be returning to <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> Park on a permanent basis after just three years at the Cardiff City Stadium.|$|E
