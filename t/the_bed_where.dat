5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>where</b> a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
25|$|In Russia before World War I the {{swastika}} was {{a favorite}} sign of the last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. She placed it where she could for happiness, including drawing it in pencil {{on the walls and}} windows in the Ipatiev House - place of execution of the royal family, and, without dating, on the wallpaper above <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>where</b> obviously slept the heir. It was printed on some banknotes of the Russian Provisional Government (1917) and some sovznaks (1918-1922). In 1919 it was approved as insignia for the Kalmyk formations, and for a short period had a certain popularity amongst some artists, politics and army groups. Also it was present on icons, vestments and clerical clothing but in World War II it was removed, becoming by association, a symbol of the German occupation.|$|E
25|$|Photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo {{understood}} that Kahlo {{did not have}} much longer to live, and thus staged her first solo exhibition in Mexico at the Galería Arte Contemporaneo in April 1953. Kahlo was initially not due to attend the opening, as her doctors had put her on bed rest. As a solution, she ordered her four-poster bed to be moved from her home to the gallery. To the surprise of the guests, she arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>where</b> she stayed {{for the duration of the}} party. The exhibition was not only a notable cultural event in Mexico, but also received attention in mainstream press around the world. The same year, five of her paintings were also included in Tate gallery's exhibition on Mexican art in London.|$|E

500|$|Mimi died on 6 December 1991, {{at the age}} of 85, {{while being}} cared for at home by Lynne Varcoe, an {{auxiliary}} nurse. During the night, other carers were present. On the day of her death, Mimi collapsed in the bathroom, so Varcoe helped her to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>where</b> Mimi started Cheyne-Stoking. According to Varcoe, her last words were, [...] "Hello, John".|$|E
500|$|Prior to European settlement, Cibolo Creek was {{referred}} to as Xoloton by the Coahuiltecan Indians. [...] The Tonkawa called it Bata Coniquiyoqui, as noted by Father Damian Massanet, who referred to the creek as Santa Crecencia in 1691. It is thought that Coahuila Governor Alonso de Leon had one of the earliest encounters with the creek in 1689 while on the first Spanish entrada to explore the French-claimed lands believed to lie beyond the Nueces River. Records suggest a camp was set up on the creek, identified as Arroyo del Leon, coined from the discovery of a dead mountain lion along the banks. Explorer Domingo Terán de los Ríos named the creek San Ygnacio de Loyola in 1691 during an expedition and Domingo Ramón referred to it as San Xavier in 1716. [...] The first known use of the term Cibolo came from Marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo who identified the stream as Río Cibolo, or Cibolo River, in 1721. Cibolo is a Spanish and Native American term for American bison (buffalo), which used to inhabit the area. The Native Americans are believed to have used the steeply banked bluffs along the creek as hunting grounds, chasing herds of buffalo into <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>where</b> the creatures would fall to their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|A soft bed, {{with high}} {{porosity}} and low pore fluid pressure, allows the glacier to move by sediment sliding: {{the base of}} the glacier may even remain frozen to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>where</b> the underlying sediment slips underneath it like a tube of toothpaste. [...] A hard bed cannot deform in this way; therefore the only way for hard-based glaciers to move is by basal sliding, where meltwater forms between the ice and the bed itself.|$|E
60|$|All {{mountains}} whatsoever, not {{composed of}} the granite or gneiss rocks described in the preceding chapter, nor volcanic, (these latter being comparatively rare,) are composed of beds, not of homogeneous, heaped materials, but of accumulated layers, whether of rock or soil. It may be slate, sandstone, limestone, gravel, or clay; but whatever the substance, it is laid in layers, not in a mass. These layers are scarcely ever horizontal, and may slope to any degree, often occurring vertical, the boldness of the hill outline commonly depending in a great degree on their inclination. In consequence of this division into beds, every mountain will have two great sets of lines more or less prevailing in its contours--one indicative of the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> <b>where</b> they come out from under each other--and the other indicative of the extremities or edges of <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> <b>where</b> their continuity has been interrupted. And these two great sets of lines will commonly be {{at right angles with}} each other, or nearly so. If the surface of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> approach a horizontal line, its termination will approach the vertical, and this is the most usual and ordinary way in which a precipice is produced.|$|R

2500|$|Porphyry {{subsequently}} {{went to live}} in Sicily, where word {{reached him}} that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in Campania which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: [...] "Strive to give back the Divine in yourselves to the Divine in the All." [...] Eustochius records that a snake crept under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>where</b> Plotinus lay, and slipped away {{through a hole in}} the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} police, Taylor {{eventually}} admitted kidnapping Tiernan. His explanation {{was that he}} had not visited Haughley Gill for many years, but by chance had been there on the afternoon that Tiernan went missing. He said that she had walked past him and on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered her head with his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her into his bedroom and onto <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>where,</b> during a struggle, she had fallen off the bed, striking her head on the floor. He said that he had then picked her up by the scarf around her neck, at which point she had died, and claimed that her death was an accident. He said he had panicked and hidden her body in Lindley Woods.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the planting season or when a hunter failed to kill animals, the people of a village gathered at [...] fetish poles (vimbundi) marked or coloured with red and white [...] clay placed in the appropriate place, often outside the house just near the door directly against <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>where</b> the heads point when people are asleep, to worship and pray to their ancestors, before the field activities start. This is also done when making offerings to there ancestors, during sicknesses or deaths where evil spirits were suspected, when bad dreams have been experienced and when summoning rains during a drought. Offerings are made {{in the form of a}} sacrifice such as killing an animal, a chicken, goat, cow, pig or sheep or any living thing with the exception of a human being. The blood of the animal was rubbed against the fetish poles (vimbundi) as respect, praise and honour to God and the spirits.|$|E

50|$|The Cumberland Plateau is {{contiguous}} {{with the}} Allegheny Plateau {{on the northern}} side, the only real difference being local naming. The sedimentary rocks that compose both plateaus are of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian geological age, composed of near-shore sediments washed westward from the old Appalachian Mountains. Some rock layers were laid down in shallow coastal waters, some, including bituminous coal seams were laid onshore in swampy environments. These are interlaced with delta formations of cross-bedded sandstones and occasionally conglomerate. There are numerous discontinuities in <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> <b>where</b> they were raised high enough to be eroded, then lowered to have more sediments added on top.|$|R

5000|$|Internal {{deformation}} {{occurs when}} {{the weight of the}} ice causes the deformation of ice crystals.
