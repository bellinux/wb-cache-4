5|$|The British Crown {{possesses}} {{a number of}} overseas territories in the Americas, for whom Queen Elizabeth II is monarch. In North America are Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction {{of a number of}} European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout {{the first half of the}} 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> Anguilla, Andrew George; <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> Bermuda, Richard Gozney; <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> the British Virgin Islands, David Pearey; <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> the Cayman Islands, Stuart Jack; <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> Montserrat, Elizabeth Carriere; and <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> the Turks and Caicos Islands, Peter Beckingham.|$|E
