However, when sharing political news, people prefer those from friends (Trust & Intimacy).

The positive impact of PML on PMG (the slope coefficients are reported to be positive) means that large potential losses imply future high potential gains—that is, the stock market overreacts <b>to</b> bad <b>news.</b> The negative impact of PMG on PML (the slope coefficients are reported to be negative) means that large potential gains hint at low potential losses—that is, the stock market underreacts <b>to</b> good <b>news.</b>|$|R

Participants (N = 114) shared good, neutral, or bad news (i. e., high, medium, or low test scores) to a stranger. News valence, delay before response, and reluctance were measured.
