5|$|In {{its largest}} market, the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS was the top-selling {{flagship}} luxury sedan for 15 {{of the first}} 17 years following its debut. In Japan, the next-largest market for <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS, {{the introduction of the}} 2007 LS 460 attracted 12,000 pre-orders, and <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class. Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus' expanded global launch in 2007, sales of <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand's traditional U.S. strongholds. By 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS ranked second globally in flagship sales, next to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class' 85,500 units, with 71,760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide, and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market. In 2008, U.S. sales fell 42% amidst the late-2000s recession, mirroring the overall decline of the luxury car market.|$|E
5|$|Development of the LS {{began in}} 1983 as the F1 project, the code {{name for a}} secret {{flagship}} sedan. The resulting sedan followed an extended five-year design process {{at a cost of}} over US$1 billion, and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features. <b>The</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS was intended from its inception for export markets, and <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally. The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales, and was largely responsible for the successful launch of <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> marque.|$|E
5|$|Global {{cumulative}} {{sales of}} Lexus brand hybrid electric cars reached the 500,000 mark in November 2012. The 1million sales milestone was achieved in March 2016. <b>The</b> <b>Lexus</b> RX 400h/RX 450h {{ranks as the}} top selling Lexus hybrid with 335,000 units delivered worldwide , followed by <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> CT 200h with 267,000 units.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS has {{not sold}} {{as well in}} Europe, where Lexus suffers from smaller brand recognition, image, and a less-developed {{dealership}} network. In European markets, <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS has ranked behind Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and BMW in flagship luxury car sales. Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity, in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (and ahead of rivals from BMW, Audi, and Jaguar) in markets outside Europe, such as South Africa.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS {{has been}} {{consistently}} produced on dedicated Lexus assembly lines at Toyota's flagship Tahara factory, located {{in the city of}} Tahara, in Aichi Prefecture, Chūbu region, southwest of Nagoya, since 1989. Tahara remains the sole production site, having inaugurated its new line number four specifically for assembly of the original LS 400.|$|E
5|$|Despite Tahara's {{large-scale}} automation, Lexus LS production {{also involves}} specialized personnel who are tasked with key production points, such as testing each vehicle's V8 engine via dynamometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation. With the LS 460, a hand-sanded paint process was introduced. The production standards used on <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS were eventually {{adopted by the}} manufacturer for other vehicles; in 2007, the assembly of Toyota Corolla economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier.|$|E

5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Rekusasu LS) is a {{full-size}} luxury car (F-segment in Europe) {{serving as the}} flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive, with Lexus also offering all-wheel-drive, hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lexus</b> brand {{launched}} in the Indian market in 2017, with the models RX450h, LX450d, LX570d and ES300h. Dealerships in Mumbai, Delhi, Gurgaon and Bangalore became operational in March 2017, when the brand began sales in India. A second set of dealerships will be in Chandigarh, Cochin and Chennai and will be operational {{toward the end of}} 2017. This made Lexus the fifth luxury brand to be {{launched in}} India, after Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, BMW and Audi.|$|E

Under <b>the</b> F marque, <b>Lexus</b> plans to produce high-performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and <b>the</b> LFA. <b>Lexus</b> officials have also discussed standard production model usage of varying platforms. The LS uses a dedicated platform, while <b>the</b> entry-level <b>Lexus</b> ES had {{been criticized for}} being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation, in both styling and powertrain design. The Nürburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.|$|R

5|$|The LS 460 and LS 460 L {{arrived at}} dealerships in Japan, the U.S., and Europe in late 2006, and the vehicle reached Australia, East Asia, and the Middle East in 2007. The U.S. base {{prices for the}} 2007 LS 460 and LS 460 L were US$61,000 and US$71,000, respectively. In 2006 and 2007, the average price paid for U.S. market LS 460 L sedans {{exceeded}} US$80,000, due largely to added options packages, placing <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS in the same average price range as its long-wheelbase Audi, BMW, and Jaguar rivals for the first time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> brand in the Japanese {{domestic}} market in 2005, Lexus sanctioned the entry of four SC 430 coupes in the Super GT series of the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship in the GT500 class. In the first race of the 2006 series, an SC 430 took the chequered flag, and drivers André Lotterer and Juichi Wakisaka raced the SC 430 to capture the GT500 championship for that year. In 2007, another SC 430 won the GT500 opening round race. In 2006, Lexus raced a hybrid vehicle for the first time, entering a GS 450h performance hybrid sedan in partnership with Sigma Advanced Racing Development at the 24 Hours of Tokachi race in Hokkaido, Japan. Lexus Canada also entered the GS 450h in 2007's Targa Newfoundland event. In 2009, Lexus Super GT Team SC 430 and IS 350 racers won the GT500 and GT300 championships, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Financial data of Lexus {{operations}} are not disclosed publicly. However, automotive analysts estimate that <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> division contributes {{a disproportionate share}} of Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and sales volume. Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle product development cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually. In 2009, Interbrand ranked Lexus as Japan's seventh largest brand, between Panasonic and Nissan, based on revenue, earnings, and market value.|$|E

At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards professional stunt driver and show co-host Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood, car expert and co-host were featured in the unveiling of the game. Foust drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger. The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a top-down shot of the pad. On the pavement the word Forza was spelled out in tire marks. Additionally in the final episode of the show's second season Wood and co-host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway, otherwise known as Sears Point; Foust drove <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LF-A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove the course in Forza Motorsport 4.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{issued a}} challenge to build the world's best car. The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS 400 to expand Toyota’s product line in the premium segment. The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models. Both the Supra and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built {{at the time was}} the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan. The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982. The F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{originated}} from a corporate project {{to develop a}} new premium sedan, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of <b>the</b> <b>Lexus</b> LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible and SUV models. Lexus did not exist as a brand in its home market until 2005, and all vehicles marketed internationally as Lexus from 1989 to 2005 were released in Japan under the Toyota marque and an equivalent model name. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. Lexus launched its own F marque performance division in 2007 with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.|$|E
