The software grouped the players into color-coded nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities. Alagappan had expected the software to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but the software instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically described positions. The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style. Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his findings with his bosses and basketball statisticians including Ken Pomeroy, who replied in encouragement.

Treatment with <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy (but not a mutant control decoy) resulted in inhibition of IRF- 1 protein expression in both cell lines, indicating specific inhibition of STAT 1 signaling by <b>the</b> <b>STAT</b> 3 decoy.
