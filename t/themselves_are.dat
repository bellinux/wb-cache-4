5|$|The Roman Baths <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> {{below the}} modern street level. There are four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House and the museum, holding finds from Roman Bath. The {{buildings}} above street level {{date from the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> scarce, more {{is known}} about the {{habitats}} they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} and infrastructure services {{are vital to}} the functionality of modern society, to provide: medical care, policing, emergency services, and lifelines such as water, wastewater, and power and transportation links. Often critical facilities <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> dependent on such lifelines for operability, which makes them vulnerable to both direct impacts from a hazard event and indirect effects from lifeline disruption.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended to fit in with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|Except for the partly {{at-grade}} Bishan MRT Station (North South Line), {{the entirety}} of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network. Underground stations and the trains <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> air-conditioned, while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.|$|E

5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print, while the {{individual}} spores <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> smooth and almond-shaped. The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each basidium bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Matrices do {{not always}} have all their entries in the same ring– or even in any ring at all.

Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E
5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2014, Team Meat {{announced}} that a sequel, Super Meat Boy: Forever, was in development for smartphones, tablets, and Steam. Forever is styled as an endless runner, though the player has additional abilities, such as combat controls, to complete levels. Levels <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> dynamically built based on the difficulty level, and get progressively more difficult as the player completes them. The game was confirmed for release in 2018 on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android systems in August 2017.|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are found}} in hair-covered areas, where they are {{connected}} to hair follicles. One or more glands may surround each hair follicle, and the glands <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> surrounded by arrector pili muscles. The glands have an acinar structure (like a many-lobed berry), in which multiple glands branch off a central duct. Relative to keratinocytes {{that make up the}} hair follicle, sebaceous glands are composed of huge cells with many large vesicles that contain the sebum. These cells express Na+ and Cl− ion channels, ENaC and CFTR (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in reference).|$|E
5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> {{part of a}} larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus are {{arboreal}} — in other words, they are tree snails. However, more {{detailed information on}} their habits is still lacking. The general feeding habits of these snails are unknown, but a few species are known to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae. Amphidromus <b>themselves</b> <b>are</b> preyed upon by birds, snakes, and probably also by smaller mammals such as rats.|$|E
