5|$|The plaintiff, Helen Palsgraf, {{was taking}} her daughters to the beach in August 1924. As two men {{attempted}} to board a train before hers, one (aided by railroad employees) dropped a package that exploded, causing a large coin-operated scale on the platform to hit her. After the incident, she began to stammer, and subsequently sued the railroad, arguing that its employees had been negligent while assisting the man, {{and that she had}} been harmed by the neglect. In May 1927 she obtained a jury verdict of $6,000, which the railroad appealed. Palsgraf gained a 3–2 decision in the Appellate Division, and the railroad appealed again. Cardozo wrote for a 4–3 majority of the Court of Appeals, ruling that there was no negligence because the employees, in helping the man board, did not have a duty of care to Palsgraf as injury <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> not a foreseeable harm from aiding a man with a package. The original jury verdict was overturned, and the railroad won the case.|$|E
5|$|In February 2002, Haze {{appeared}} in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. The company <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> {{more than just a}} business, but a family too. She also enjoyed {{the idea of having a}} group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E

25|$|The film {{marked a}} long-awaited reunion between Almodóvar and Antonio Banderas, reunited after 21 years. Penélope Cruz was {{initially}} slated {{for the role}} of the captive patient Vera Cruz, but she was unable to take part as she was pregnant with her first child. As a result, Elena Anaya, who had appeared in Talk <b>to</b> <b>Her,</b> <b>was</b> cast.|$|E
25|$|In October 1886 {{her oldest}} sister, Marie, entered the same Carmelite monastery, adding to Thérèse's grief.

Her frequent tears made some friends {{think she had}} a weak character and the Guérins indeed shared this opinion.|$|E
25|$|The city {{lay on the}} Isinnitum Canal, part {{of a set of}} {{waterways}} {{that connected}} the cities of Mesopotamia. The patron deity of Isin was Nintinuga (Gula) goddess of healing, and a temple <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> built there. The Isin king Enlil-bani reported building a temple to Gula named E-ni-dub-bi, a temple for Sud named E-dim-gal-an-na, a temple E-ur-gi-ra to Ninisina, as well as a temple for the god Ninbgal.|$|E

25|$|Her {{full name}} at birth was Huberdina Maria Hertogh. To Dutch and other westerners she was {{normally}} known as Bertha (or Berta) Hertogh.

However, Maria Hertogh was the name most frequently used in court proceedings and the English press. She died in 2009, Huijbergen, The Netherlands.|$|E

25|$|A Prince Apepi, named on a seal (now in Berlin) {{is likely}} to have been his son. Apepi also had a daughter, named Herit: a vase {{belonging}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> found in a tomb at Thebes, sometimes regarded as the one of king Amenhotep I, which might indicate that at some point his daughter was married to a Theban king. The vase, however, could have been an item which was looted from Avaris after the eventual victory over the Hyksos by Ahmose I.|$|E

25|$|Lavia was {{a cruise}} ship that caught fire and sank in Hong Kong Harbour in 1989. She was built for Cunard White Star Line in 1947 as the cargo liner Media. In 1961 she was sold to Italy, rebuilt as an ocean liner and renamed Flavia. In 1969, she was {{refitted}} as {{a cruise ship}} and renamed Flavian. In 1982 she was sold to Panama and renamed Lavia. She was undergoing a refit when the fire occurred. The damage <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> so great that she was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Talk <b>to</b> <b>Her</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in April 2002 in Spain, followed by its international premiere at the Telluride Film Festival in September of that year. It was hailed by critics and embraced by arthouse audiences, particularly in America. The unanimous praise for Talk to Her resulted in Almodóvar winning his second Academy Award, {{this time for}} Best Original Screenplay, {{as well as being}} nominated in the Best Director category. The film also won the César Award for Best Film from the European Union and both the BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

25|$|On August 1, Greenlee asks David {{for help}} about her leg numbness. She tells David {{that she saw}} someone else besides herself, him and Gale, in the {{hospital}} room. He admits that there is someone {{in the room and}} that he will help her. However, she has to go with him to a clinic that is in Brazil. On August 2, Ryan tells Greenlee that he wants her to go to Brazil. On August 4, it was revealed that Greenlee lied about her leg numbness. The only reason she went with David was so that she could see Leo. David injects her with something before leaving. When Greenlee wakes up, she sees Leo, laying on the hospital bed. On August 5, when Greenlee and Leo share a kiss, it turns out that Greenlee was dreaming; it is revealed that the person who was next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> Zach. She is soon brought back from The Orpheus Project that David created.|$|E

25|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{highlighted}} inconsistency in honouring {{those in}} Canada's royal family. For example, the Queen Mother was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on only an honorary basis, though the Canadian Forces Decoration awarded <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> substantive. Similarly, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was offered only honorary {{appointment to the}} Order of Canada, which he refused on the grounds that, as the royal consort of the Queen, he was Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment, {{as he had been}} awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration and Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan. In 2013, the constitutions of the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit were amended to create {{for each of the three}} grades of each order an extraordinary category reserved for those members of the Royal Family (in the Canadian Forces for the latter order) nominated and approved for appointment. Upon taking office, governors general and viceregal consorts become Extraordinary Companions of the Order of Canada and the governor general an Extraordinary Commander of the Order of Military Merit.|$|E
25|$|At midday on 3 October 1836 the {{foundation}} stone was laid by Ann Thwaytes. At 11 am gentlemen inhabitants, subscribers and visitors joined a procession at the St George's Baths and walked {{with the local}} charity school children (beneficiaries of Mrs Thwaytes) to the site to present her with a silver trowel. The ceremony was watched by invited ladies seated on a dais in a plantation decorated with flags, and enlivened by a military band. At 2 pm the charity children and their parents, totalling 500, received a free dinner provided by Mrs Thwaytes. In the afternoon there were boat races, a punt chase and a tightrope performance. On the Pier during the evening there was a Grand Illumination, a firework display, another tightrope performance, magic feats by Ching Lau Lauro, {{a model of the}} Clock Tower in fireworks, the Pier entrance illuminated by 30,000 variegated lamps, and a released balloon carrying Mrs Thwaytes' name in fire. An address of thanks <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> read by George Rohrs, secretary to the Clock Tower trustees who had been appointed by Mrs Thwaytes.|$|E
500|$|As a {{very private}} man, Longfellow did not often add autobiographical {{elements}} to his poetry. Two notable exceptions are dedicated {{to the death of}} members of his family. [...] "Resignation" [...] was written {{as a response to the}} death of his daughter Fanny in 1848; it does not use first-person pronouns and is instead a generalized poem of mourning. The death of his second wife Frances, as biographer Charles Calhoun wrote, deeply affected Longfellow personally but [...] "seemed not to touch his poetry, at least directly". His memorial poem <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> the sonnet [...] "The Cross of Snow" [...] and was not published in his lifetime.|$|E
