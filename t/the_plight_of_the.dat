5|$|The plebeians {{had finally}} {{achieved}} political equality with the patricians. However, <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average plebeian had not changed. A {{small number of}} plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been. The plebeians rebelled by leaving Rome and refusing to return until they had more rights. The patricians then noticed how much they needed the plebeians and accepted their terms. The plebeians then returned to Rome and continued their work.|$|E
5|$|Economic reforms {{addressed}} <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, {{which was}} becoming {{an issue in}} pre-Islamic Mecca. The Quran requires payment of an alms tax (zakat) {{for the benefit of}} the poor; as Muhammad's power grew he demanded that tribes who wished to ally with him implement the zakat in particular.|$|E
5|$|In April 2017, Warren {{published}} her eleventh book titled, , {{where she}} explores <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American {{middle class and}} argues {{that the federal government}} needs to do more to help out working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education.|$|E
25|$|In January 1866, Congress renewed the Freedmen's Bureau; however, Johnson {{vetoed the}} Freedmen's Bureau Bill in February 1866. Although Johnson had sympathies for <b>the</b> <b>plights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freedmen, {{he was against}} federal assistance. An attempt to {{override}} the veto failed on February 20, 1866. This veto shocked the Congressional Radicals. In response, both the Senate and House passed a joint resolution not to allow any Senator or Representative seat admittance until Congress decided when Reconstruction was finished.|$|R

The record's densely produced music incorporates funk, R, hip hop, soul, jazz, and electronica styles.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberation of}} Belgium begun in September 1944 as Allied forces moved eastwards. Brussels was liberated on 3 September. On 8 September, Pierlot and the {{government}} in exile arrived in the city by aeroplane. The return of the government was met with general indifference by the population, which felt the government had been indifferent to <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had warned the French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French ground and air forces at this stage meant that {{the failure of the}} operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
50|$|Captain Underpants and <b>the</b> Preposterous <b>Plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Purple Potty People is {{the eighth}} {{book in the}} Captain Underpants series by Dav Pilkey. It was {{published}} on August 15, 2006, two years and eleven months after the previous book.|$|R
25|$|Central to {{accounts}} <b>of</b> Norse mythology are <b>the</b> <b>plights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{gods and}} their interaction with various other beings, such {{as with the}} jötnar, who may be friends, lovers, foes or family members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods. Numerous gods are mentioned in the source texts. As evidenced by records of personal names and place names, the most popular god among the Scandinavians during the Viking Age was Thor, who is portrayed as unrelentingly pursuing his foes, his mountain-crushing, thunderous hammer Mjölnir in hand. In the mythology, Thor lays waste to numerous jötnar who are foes to the gods or humanity, and is wed to the beautiful, golden-haired goddess Sif.|$|R
50|$|Between July 1972 and December 1973, the Initiative Group issued {{only two}} documents, rejecting the accusations and {{reporting}} the conditions and procedure of interrogations. In 1974, it resumed its activity {{with a steady}} stream <b>of</b> protests focusing on <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> inmates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulag and psychiatric hospitals. As a result, a large volume of testimonies about prisons and camps entered <b>the</b> information networks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement.|$|R
5|$|In 2001 the Iranian {{government}} {{collaborated with}} the Cheetah Conservation Fund, the IUCN, Panthera, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey, to ensure that development projects do not hamper its survival, and to highlight <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Asiatic cheetah. Iran declared 31August as National Cheetah Day in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In November 1907 {{six more}} {{families}} consisting of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, {{which has a}} sheltered beach. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay {{with the aim of}} providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.|$|E
5|$|Petrossian {{originally}} thought {{to write a}} video treatment about a refugee trying to enter the United States, but knew that the band was going to receive several treatments with the same idea. Instead, he decided to portray <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refugee from a different angle. The band members unanimously agreed upon Petrossian's treatment. The video deals various themes, including consumerism, fair trade, and sweatshops, and attempts showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations.|$|E
50|$|In 1844, Bahá’u’lláh {{heard of}} a new faith Bábism and {{accepted}}. At 23, Ásíyih Khánum accepted the faith and their family became one its most prominent members. The Núrí family lived in the capital Tehran or sometimes Mazandaran - <b>the</b> norm <b>of</b> upper-class Persian families.

5|$|The second season, {{along with}} its ongoing {{examination}} of the drug problem {{and its effect on}} the urban poor, examines <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by stevedores in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port. In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.|$|E
5|$|According to {{consolidated}} {{figures the}} episode was watched by 3.28 million viewers on its BBC two debut, aggregated to 4.74 million viewers after {{taking into consideration}} two repeat broadcasts the same week. Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive. Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet. Whilst some reviewers identified with <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant that it was hard to feel any sympathy for it.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E

40|$|Historians {{have largely}} ignored {{the role that}} Rochdale co-operatives have played in <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> many Australians. When {{considered}} by historians, Rochdale co‑operatives in Australia are generally dismissed as being insignificant to <b>the</b> <b>plights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labour movement and <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> wider society, apart from those situated in coal mining districts. This paper challenges such assumptions by providing an historical overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent and incidence of Rochdale co-operatives in Australia. It primarily focuses on consumer co-operatives at the local level, and maps the extent and impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rochdale movement based on <b>the</b> typology <b>of</b> coalfields, rural and metropolitan co-operatives developed by W K McConnell (1929). While the Rochdale movement in Australia has largely collapsed, Rochdale co‑operatives still survive in some rural locations, despite McConnell’s grim predictions. 11 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmers. Hager tried to appeal to {{both sides of the}} conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E
5|$|To bolster his {{authority}} {{and secure the}} position of the crown, James launched preemptive attacks on some of his nobles beginning in 1425 with his close kinsmen the Albany Stewarts resulting in the execution of Duke Murdoch and his sons. In 1428 James detained Alexander, Lord of the Isles, while attending a parliament in Inverness. Archibald, 5th Earl of Douglas, was arrested in 1431, followed by George, Earl of March, in 1434. <b>The</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ransom hostages held in England was ignored and the repayment money was diverted into the construction of Linlithgow Palace and other grandiose schemes.|$|E
25|$|Gore easily {{defeated}} Bradley in the primaries, {{largely because}} <b>of</b> support from <b>the</b> Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor {{showing in the}} Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> farmers. <b>The</b> closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary. On March 14, Al Gore clinched the Democratic nomination.|$|R

40|$|Most people {{place their}} sincerest hopes for {{emotional}} fulfillment on a rewarding family life. The "loved ones" that constitute our nuclear and extended familial worlds are <b>the</b> primary beneficiaries <b>of</b> our affections and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruits <b>of</b> our labors. In {{return for the}} primacy we accord our family members, we expect their behavior to demonstrate their loyalty to the clan. However, {{at a certain point}} obligations to the family can conflict with <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual. In this thesis I examine how filial duties influence <b>the</b> <b>plights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tragic heroines in Sophocles's Antigone and Shakespeare's King Lear. Both Antigone and Cordelia organize their lives around <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> family honor, and yet <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> these commitments is not sufficient to spare them from their respective, calamitous ends. Their unwavering dedication to <b>the</b> sanctity <b>of</b> family bonds leaves them susceptible, as individuals, to great harm...|$|R
5|$|Although the Palaeologi {{emperors}} recaptured Constantinople {{from the}} Western Europeans in 1261, {{they were never}} able to regain control of much of the former imperial lands. They usually controlled only a small section of the Balkan Peninsula near Constantinople, the city itself, and some coastal lands on the Black Sea and around the Aegean Sea. The former Byzantine lands in the Balkans were divided between the new Kingdom of Serbia, the Second Bulgarian Empire and the city-state of Venice. The power of the Byzantine emperors was threatened by a new Turkish tribe, the Ottomans, who established themselves in Anatolia in the 13th century and steadily expanded throughout the 14th century. The Ottomans expanded into Europe, reducing Bulgaria to a vassal state by 1366 and taking over Serbia after its defeat at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Western Europeans rallied to <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christians in the Balkans and declared a new crusade in 1396; a great army was sent to the Balkans, where it was defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. Constantinople was finally captured by the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash economy grew, {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and the coffee and sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who were from a wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul Classe), were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hutu. Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave the Hutu a social mobility not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E
5|$|Despite his administration's scandals, Grant {{continued}} to be personally popular. His reelection was supported by Frederick Douglas and other prominent abolitionists along with reformers of the Indian question. A growing number of political reformers, however, were disappointed by the Gold Ring, Grant's support of Reconstruction, and corruption in the New York Customs House. To placate them, Grant created a Civil Service Commission authorized by Congress in 1871. The Commission, chaired by reformer George William Curtis, proposed reformist rules and regulations, which Grant implemented by executive order in April 1872, Congress appropriating funds in May. Congress stopped funding the Commission in December 1875, having refused to pass legislation to implement its recommendations. There was further intraparty division between the faction most concerned with <b>the</b> <b>plight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freedmen, and the faction concerned {{with the growth of}} industry and small government. During the war, both factions' interests had aligned, and in 1868 both had supported Grant. As the wartime coalition began to fray, Grant's alignment with the party's pro-Reconstruction elements alienated party leaders who favored an end to federal intervention in Southern racial issues.|$|E
