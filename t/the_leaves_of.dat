One was discovered by Nelson in 1972, the other by Alex George in 1974. They are about 5km apart, and differ somewhat. The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A.cuneatus, but <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> mature shoots are very long and narrow, and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> younger shoots are deeply lobed.|$|E

5|$|A {{description}} of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, in reference to <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf shape is often seen in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- ("inverse") and ovum ("egg"), and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests {{in the base}} of an old cabbage tree {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{species have}} a long history of human utilisation. Carbonised Attalea maripa seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 9000 BP. A variety of species remain {{important}} sources of edible oil, thatch, edible seeds and fibre. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> Attalea butyracea and A.maripa are used extensively for thatching. Several species are oil palms, with A.speciosa among the most important economically. Products extracted from A.speciosa were reported to support over 300,000 households in the Brazilian state of Maranhão in 2005, and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450,000 households throughout the Brazil. Piassava fibres, extracted from the leaf bases of A.funifera, are commercially important, and generated about US$20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, iterated mathematical constructs having fractal dimension. Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa, corals, hydrozoa like the air fern, Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (internode length), and number of branches per branch point.|$|E

The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides of <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> F.rubiginosa are the easiest {{distinguishing}} features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (F.obliqua), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12mm long and 4–11mm in diameter, compared with 7–17mm long and 8–17mm diameter for F. rubiginosa.|$|E
5|$|Labillardière {{eventually}} {{published the}} genus Adenanthos, along with A.cuneatus {{and two other}} species, in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. He chose the specific name cuneata in reference to <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> this species, which are cuneate (triangular). This name has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus. He did not designate which of the three published species was {{to serve as the}} type species of Adenanthos, but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen A.cuneatus as lectotype for the genus, since the holotype of A.cuneatus bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardière's description of it is the most detailed of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> holly plants, for instance, are very smooth and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E

The specific name sasicola refers to the fact the species grows upon <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> Sasa species. The Japanese common name for the species is Sasa-no-houraitake. Within the genus Mycena, it probably belongs to the section Marasmius, and the subsection Penicillati, due to characters of the stem, gills and pileipellis (the outer-most layer of the cap).|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> the tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge.

Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
