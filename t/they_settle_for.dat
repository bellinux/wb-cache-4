Presently, Diego was let down but he too could not go farther down than half of the way. When it was Juan's turn to go he allowed himself to be let down to the lowest depths of the cistern. There the prince discovered two enchanted palaces, the first being occupied by Princess Juana who informed him she was being held prisoner by a giant, and the second by Princess Leonora, also the prisoner of a large seven-headed serpent. After killing the giant and the serpent, the prince tugged on the cord and soon came up to the surface of the earth with the two captive princesses, whom his two brothers soon wanted to take away from him. Diego desired Princess Juana for himself and Pedro wanted Princess Leonora. Before the parting, however, Leonora discovered that she left her ring in the innermost recesses of the well. Juan voluntarily offered to take it for her but when he was halfway down, the two brothers cut the rope he was descending causing him to fall to the bottom of the well. Not long after this, wedding bells were rung in the palace. Diego married Princess Juana but Princess Leonora before casting her lot with Prince Pedro requested her marriage to him delayed for a term of seven years because she might still have a chance to unite herself with Don Juan.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Educational {{reformers and}} most of the American public believe that most {{teachers}} ask too little of their pupils. These low expectations, they believe, result in watered down curricula and a tolerance of mediocre teaching and inappropriate student behavior. The result is that the prophecy of low achievement becomes self-fulfilling. Although research has shown that learning gains are substantially larger when students take more demanding courses 2, only a minority of students enroll in these courses. There are several reasons for this. Guidance counselors in many schools allow only a select few into the most challenging courses. While most schools give students and parents the authority to overturn counselor recommendations, many families are unaware they have that power or are intimidated by the counselor’s prediction of failure in the tougher class. As one student put it: “African-American parents, <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> less, not knowing they can get more for their students. ...|$|E

On the other hand, the debtor will not pay back more than the outstanding liability (upper bound). In the case of redemption, the redemption payment should lie within the interval identified above. The difference between the realized redemption payment and the lower bound constitutes the premium.

40|$|Mobile service {{platforms}} {{are becoming}} particularly important as {{play a significant}} role in consumers' decisions to accept, adopt and use mobile services and applications. Literature on mobile service platforms focuses mainly on strategic issues in managing multi-sided platforms and economic issues of two sided markets, still literature is highly conceptual and empirical research on the awareness and preferences of consumers is lacking. Yet, there is a lack of empirical research on platforms developed by mobile network operators. By making use of conjoint analysis, 62 Finnish respondents participated in an empirical study. The conjoint analysis results show that application costs and type of operating system are the most important criteria to make a decision and the provider of the service platform is not of the concern. However, consumers value issues such as security and privacy arrangement which are often guaranteed by network operators. Our findings have three suggestions to mobile network operators: (1), <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> becoming a bit-pipe provider, (2), open their platforms, and (3), let other market competitors such as Apple, Google, Facebook be responsible for providing mobile services and applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} of IEEE 802. 11 ’s bandwidth {{led to a}} deployment of many multimedia applications over wireless networks. Nevertheless, these applications impose stringent constraints in QoS. In this context, a lot of works have been proposed {{in order to enhance}} the QoS-capable IEEE 802. 11 e MAC protocol. However, <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> maintaining only an inter-QoS differentiation between the traffic classes, and neglect the intra-Qos differentiation. In fact, the flows belonging to the same service class are assigned the same MAC parameters regardless of their data rate, which leads to throughput fairness rather than perceived QoS fairness. On the other hand, the proposed schemes exhibit performance degradation when the number of flows increases. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol based on the reservation of the wireless channel through the use of transmission Opportunity (TXOPlimit) parameter. Each traffic class monitors the MAC queue and computes at runtime the TXOPlimit’s value. Thus based on the class ’ priority and flow’s data rate, we can ensure both intra and inter QoS differentiation. Additionally, we specify a distributed admission control mechanism that regulates the network load and protects the admitted flows from the new ones. Simulation results show that compared to the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) scheme of 802. 11 e, our protocol excels, in terms of network utilization and ability to maintain intra-QoS data rate differentiation. Further when introducing the admission control mechanism, we ensure high protection to the admitted flows, and maintain the network in steady state...|$|E

40|$|The three essays {{that form}} this thesis concern {{contributions}} made by private individuals to {{various types of}} public goods. The first essay is about the provision of higher education, {{with a focus on}} compulsory contributions to this good. A microeconomic model is presented in which it is assumed that government is prepared to fund education to a certain extent through general taxation. The remaining portion is to be financed either through fees at the beginning of studies or through a graduate tax on completion of studies. The analysis reveals a trade-off: compared to tuition fees, a graduate tax reduces work incentives because a graduate's marginal revenue from work is lower. At the same time, such a tax induces universities to improve their teaching quality as they stand to gain from increased tax revenue. It is demonstrated that if revenues are distributed evenly among universities, the universities free-ride on others' efforts to increase education quality and so <b>they</b> <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> a lower quality of education. This problem is then solved by allocating each university the tax revenue from its own alumni. It is also shown how a budget-balancing graduate tax encourages higher university participation than the equivalent tuition fee. Continuing the theme of taxation, the second essay reports results from a laboratory experiment that tests the effect of forcing contributions, through a charity tax, on people's voluntary donations of money to charitable organizations. The experiment seeks to investigate the effects of imposing a small, a medium and a large income tax on donor behavior, where the tax revenue and donations both go to the same good cause. Contrary to economic reasoning, it is found that the small charity tax crowds out donations from male participants to the extent that total contributions to the cause are reduced. This result cannot be explained by the theory of warm glow (Andreoni, 1990), which predicts only partial crowding out. However, an explanation for the observed behavior is provided by psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966) : male participants in the experiment were willing to donate generously to the cause without any interference from a tax, but when forced to make a small contribution through a small tax, they reacted adversely by reducing total contributions below their "natural" level. Somewhat surprisingly, the charity tax is found to crowd in donations from female participants. The third essay compares voluntary contributions of time to formal charitable organizations with time spent helping others in informal settings, using detailed diary data from the German Time Use Survey 2001 / 02. A bivariate probit model is applied to calculate simultaneously the probability of volunteering formally and the probability of volunteering informally. The residual correlation estimate for the female sample is positive, meaning that {{women are more likely to}} volunteer formally if they also volunteer informally. This suggests that the decisions are complementary. However, for men, the decisions to volunteer formally and informally are not found to be significantly related. Further analysis of the subsample of full-time workers reveals an even stronger positive correlation between formal and informal volunteering among women who work full-time...|$|E
