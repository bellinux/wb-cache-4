30|$|Sensitivity {{refers to}} the number of <b>times</b> <b>that</b> the system could {{automatically}} adjust the application volume on out of the number of times the user manually adjusted the application volume on (i.e., how much the system could estimate the application volume on).

Positive Predictive Value (PPV) refers {{to the number of}} <b>times</b> <b>that</b> the user wanted to adjust the application volume on out of the number of <b>times</b> <b>that</b> the system automatically adjusted application volume off (i.e., the rate of correct estimation of application volume on versus adjusted by the system).

Accuracy refers to the rate of correct estimation of all. The higher the sensitivity, the fewer times the user needs to adjust the application volume on.
