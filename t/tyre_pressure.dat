5|$|Hamilton {{completed}} the second Grand Slam {{of his career}} by winning the race, taking pole position, setting the fastest lap and leading every lap of the race. He finished 25 seconds ahead of Vettel, while Felipe Massa finished third for Williams. Rosberg retired with three laps to go due to an engine failure, resulting in Hamilton extending his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 53 points. Hamilton's victory was confirmed {{a few hours after}} the race following an investigation from race stewards after it was discovered that the left-rear tyre on his Mercedes was below Pirelli's recommended minimum <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> standards in a random check but due to procedural inconsistencies, no sanctions were imposed against either Mercedes driver or the team.|$|E

40|$|Proof rolling of {{granular}} layers in aircraft pavements is {{an integral}} part of the pavement thickness design methods used in Australia. The Department of Defence has a fleet of special purpose pneumatic tyred rollers with the capability to operate at up to 50 t on four wheels with <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> of 1, 400 kPa. In 2004 the tyre manufacturers reduced the maximum allowable <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> to 1, 000 kPa, creating a gap between aircraft load and the capacity of the proof rollers. To allow flexible aircraft pavements to continue to be constructed, one roller was upgraded to include solid urethane tyres with an effective contract pressure of 1, 700 kPa and higher. Whilst this roller has undergone a preliminary trial that was found to be successful, further trials are required prior to upgrading the remaining roller fleet...|$|R

Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|Vehicle tyres (as in {{the rest}} of the world) mark the rim {{diameter}} in inches and the width in millimetres. A car tyre marked '165/70R13' has a width of 165 mm, an aspect ratio (profile) of 70% and a 13-inch rim diameter. <b>Tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> may be given in both kilopascals and [...] "pounds per square inch".|$|R
50|$|Other {{advantages}} {{of this system}} include a decreased chance of pinch flats, {{it can be made}} to operate in a wider range of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> (from 25 to 200 psi). Furthermore, when a tubular goes flat at high speed there is a safety margin because it is less likely to roll off the rim if it is properly glued on.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft <b>tyre</b> {{inflation}} <b>pressures</b> and {{wheel loads}} have increased {{over time and}} this trend {{is not expected to}} abate in the future. With increased <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> has come increased shear forces induced by braking aircraft. An increase in reports of interface debonding and delamination failures of asphalt surfaces on runways has followed in Australia, Japan and South Africa. Octahedral shear and normal stresses were calculated for extreme braking aircraft of various <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> and wheel loads. The historical increase in <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> of around 50 % was shown to have resulted in a moderate 10 % increase in the stress-strength ratio associated with the surface layer interface. The factor of safety associated with interface shear strength was shown to be negligible. New interface construction techniques or tack coat materials with increase adhesion are required {{to reduce the risk of}} further shear-related delamination of asphalt surfaces in high stress applications such as runways...|$|R
25|$|All EE-9 Cascavels have {{a similar}} layoutthe driver is seated {{at the front of}} the vehicle and to the left, turrets are {{typically}} fitted above the centre, with motor and transmission situated at the rear. The Cascavel Mk II has a manual turret, but all later variants have electrically powered traverse. Cascavel Mk IIIs are equipped with an Engesa EC-90 90mm gun firing high explosive (HE), high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) or high explosive squash head (HESH) shells in cartridge form; a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun is also mounted to the left of the main armament. The EC-90 has an elevation of +15° and a depression of -8°. It is not stabilised and only mounts a rudimentary optical fire control system, which has been upgraded with a laser rangefinder in Brazilian service. Late production Cascavels were fitted with run-flat tyres and a unique central <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> regulator accessible from the driving compartment.|$|E

25|$|In {{the safety}} aspect the Statesman comes with Bosch Electronic Stability Control, {{traction}} control, ABS brakes, EBD, BAS and a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring system as standard Front, side and curtain airbags come as standard {{which is another}} incentive to improve the Caprice's safety equipment, this {{also contributed to the}} fact that the Caprice’s safety rating surpass that off its main rival, the LTD. Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E
50|$|In his 13 September 1967 Motor Cycle article, Dixon {{reported}} both bikes {{were the}} same production TT race specification with lighting and (road-legal) megaphone-style silencers but had been stripped, checked and re-built, with special preparation being limited to larger six-gallon petrol tanks, modified racing seats, improved fairings from the forthcoming 1968 range and 45 psi <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures.</b> The object was to use two over-the-counter customised bikes, basically the same as could be bought.|$|R

25|$|Lieb {{reported}} his car had a vibration while Hartley {{was warned}} about track limits. The No. 95 Aston Martin continued to the lead the LMGTE Pro field but the team's No. 98 car required a door change because it {{lost one of}} its wing mirrors, dropping it to sixth. Joël Camathias in KCMG's Porsche was now running {{at the front of}} LMGTE Am ahead of the second-placed No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. Jarvis closed to 0.8 seconds behind Hartley until the latter responded by going half a second quicker but later reported his car was loose under braking when entering the track's corners. Hartley lost time through traffic and Jarvis overtook him for the lead at the NGK chicane. Hartley was caught by Lotterer who passed him for second at the first turn. Porsche identified a loss in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in Hartley's car and chose to pit him, and Webber climbed aboard the No. 1 car. Lieb made a pit stop from the lead, handing first and second positions to both Toyota cars. Buemi held it for the next few laps until their stops and ceded it to Webber. Pierre Ragues became the LMGTE Am leader after moving in front of François Perrodo and the KCMG Porsche. The first full course yellow was necessitated when Perrodo spun his car into the NGK chicane gravel trap. Marshals cleaned the track at the ninth and twelfth turns.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old for that! I even said to the team I’m getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s not fair to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to impacts and {{vibrations}} {{has been}} shown to be detrimental to cross country mountain bike performance and health. Therefore, any strategy aimed at attenuating such exposure is useful to participants and/or industry. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of tyre size and <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> on exposure to impacts. Participants completed nine trials of a technical section (controlled for initial speed and route taken) including nine separate conditions involving three tyre sizes and three <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> normalised per <b>tyre.</b> Performance was determined by time to negotiate the technical section while triaxial accelerometers recorded accelerations (128 [*]Hz) to quantify impact exposure and the subsequent effects on soft tissue response. Increases in tyre size within the range used improved performance P< 0. 0001 while changes to <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> had no effect P= 0. 6870 on performance. Larger tyre sizes and lower <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> significantly P< 0. 0001 reduced exposure to impacts which could be augmented or negated due to an interaction between tyre size and inflation pressure P< 0. 0001. It is recommended that mountain bikers use larger tyres, inflated to the moderate pressures used within this study, in order to increase performance and reduce the risk of overuse injuries...|$|R
5000|$|Access to Kalabo (the nearest town to Liuwa Plain National Park) {{has been}} vastly {{improved}} {{due to a}} tar road being built over the floodplains which has recently been complete.

To get into the park there is one water crossing, a pontoon which 4x4 vehicles {{can go on and}} from {{there is no longer any}} tar but sandy roads. 4x4 vehicles will be needed to access the park and <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> should be put down to accommodate the sandy conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Studies on {{the effects}} of {{off-road}} driving on soils were conducted in the Makuleke Contractual Park of the Kruger National Park. The studies were conducted on three different soils with different textures and soil com-pactibilities. Traffic pressure was applied with a game drive vehicle loaded with 11 sand bags, each weighing 70 kg. This gave a total vehicle mass of 3, 795 kg, simulating a vehicle fully laden with tourists. The study included: (i) comparing of the effects of four different tyre pressures; (ii) comparing the effects of 1 – 3 vehicle passes over the same tyre tracks; (iii) comparison of traffic effects under dry and wet soil moisture conditions, on soil compaction, respectively. After each pass penetration resistances were measured (a) on the tyre tracks, (b) between the tyre tracks and (c) at different distances outside the tyre tracks. As expected, vehicular traffic caused soil compaction below the wheel tracks. Lower <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> caused less com-paction than higher <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures.</b> Fewer vehicle passes also caused less compaction than more passes on the same tracks, but most compaction occurred during the first pass. Thus, driving on the same tracks more than once is less damaging than driving once on different tracks. Con-trolled traffic should be considered when developing management strategies for off-road driving in wildlife protected areas...|$|R
500|$|For {{more than}} two hours after the race, Hamilton's victory was still up for debate, as his left rear tyres was found to have had 0.3psi less <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> than regulated. While Lewis Hamilton stated in the post-race press conference that he had not been aware of the issue, Williams {{officials}} Pat Symonds and Rob Smedley called for Hamilton's disqualification, with the latter pointing out that it was [...] "a safety issue". The stewards eventually decided not to take any further action, stating that: [...] "In making this determination regarding the pressure, the stewards noted that the tyre warming blankets had been disconnected from their power source, as is normal procedure, and the tyres were significantly below the maximum permitted tyre blanket temperature {{at the time of the}} FIA's measurement on the grid and at significantly different temperatures from other cars measured on the grid. Further, the stewards are satisfied that the team followed the currently specified procedure, supervised by the tyre manufacturer for the safe operation of the tyres. Therefore, the stewards decide to take no further action." ...|$|E
500|$|The team's struggles {{continued}} as the championship moved to Brazil for the penultimate round, with Alonso stopping twice {{on the circuit}} during free practice with a recurring engine fault that forced him to miss qualifying. Button and Alonso finished the race in fifteenth and sixteenth place respectively, which became fourteenth and fifteenth when Felipe Massa was disqualified for a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> irregularity. Button later noted that the speed deficit of the RA615H around the Interlagos circuit relative to the other engines was [...] "scary" [...] despite Honda's extensive development programme. By the time the season {{came to a close}} in Abu Dhabi, McLaren had completely shifted the MP4-30's development so that the car became a testing platform for the 2016 season, with [...] "more than half" [...] of the parts being considered experimental, including a brand-new configuration for the rear suspension geometry. Despite an expected speed deficit on the long straights of the Yas Marina Circuit—with the MP4-30 recording speeds some [...] slower than the fastest cars through the speed trap—and minor contact with Valtteri Bottas in the pit lane, Button was complimentary of the car in his drive to twelfth, describing it as [...] "the best it had felt all year". Alonso went on to finish seventeenth after receiving a drive-through penalty for his role in causing a collision with Pastor Maldonado and Felipe Nasr on the opening lap. McLaren used Alonso's race as a chance to experiment with full and continuous deployment of the RA615H's Energy Recovery Systems—the first time the team had done so under race conditions—which saw Alonso set the third-fastest lap of the race, less than three tenths of a second slower than the fastest lap of the race recorded by Lewis Hamilton.|$|E
500|$|With the {{championship}} returning to Asia {{for the second}} round of flyaway races, the team arrived in Singapore confident of scoring points; despite both cars advancing to the second period of qualifying and running in the top ten throughout the race, both cars retired with gearbox problems. Alonso was forced out after his car kept selecting neutral without input—a problem that affected several drivers; Button was involved in contact with Pastor Maldonado while trying to pass the slow-moving Alexander Rossi during a safety car restart before his gearbox overheated. After experimenting with a new front wing designed to improve air flow around the front tyres during free practice in Singapore, the team introduced the parts at the next race in Japan one week later. However, the team struggled with tyre pressures; following Sebastian Vettel's high-speed tyre blow-out during the Belgian Grand Prix, the FIA introduced a mandatory minimum <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> setting on the advice of tyre supplier Pirelli. For the Japanese Grand Prix, these pressures were raised by [...] compared to the levels used during the 2014 race, which affected the MP4-30's ride height and vertical suspension travel and produced increased understeer. Despite taking advantage of grid penalties that saw them start twelfth and fourteenth respectively, Alonso and Button went on to finish eleventh and sixteenth. With the team acknowledging that the Singapore Grand Prix had represented their final opportunity to score points on merit, their focus shifted to development of their 2016 car over the final leg of {{the championship}}. In addition to the engine upgrades Honda brought to Russia, the team sought to use the high-speed and low-degradation characteristics of the Sochi Autodrom circuit to test experimental bodywork parts, including the exhaust configuration. In a race of attrition, both Button and Alonso initially finished in the points, with Button in ninth and Alonso taking tenth until Alonso was given a five-second penalty after the race that relegated him to eleventh place.|$|E
