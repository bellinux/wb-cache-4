5|$|The town of Sibu has two bus stations. The {{local bus}} station {{is located at}} the {{waterfront}} near the Sibu wharf terminal. <b>The</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus station is located at Pahlawan Street, near the Sungai Antu region. Jaya Li Hua Commercial Centre and Medan Hotel are located next to <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus station. The local bus station at the waterfront serves the town area, Sibu Airport, Sibu Jaya, Kanowit, and Sarikei. Lanang Bus serves the connection between the local bus station and <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus station while Panduan Hemat buses serves Sibu Airport and satellite township of Sibu Jaya. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus station serves Kuching, Bintulu, and Miri via the Pan Borneo Highway. Some of the buses serving at <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus station are Biaramas, Suria Bus, and Borneo Highway Express.|$|E
5|$|During the Berlin Blockade, <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> traffic came to {{an almost}} {{complete}} halt. The Stadtbahn was useful for the re-established S-Bahn, however, now with connections to places line Königs Wusterhausen, Strausberg, Staaken and Falkensee.|$|E
5|$|In October 1994 a {{large-scale}} modernisation programme was {{started on the}} Stadtbahn. The viaducts were checked and strengthened, and the tracks were bedded in concrete to improve durability and comfort. Almost all stations saw large financial investments and were thoroughly modernised. Long-distance traffic between Zoo and Ostbahnhof stations was interrupted during the construction period and the S-Bahn trains temporarily used <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> line.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{operation}} of <b>long-distance</b> services via Meissen ended in 1965. Finally, <b>the</b> last <b>long-distance</b> services on <b>the</b> line were {{a pair of}} Warsaw-Leipzig expresses.|$|R

5|$|Regular bus {{services}} and taxis {{operate in the}} town. The town has long-distance, short-distance and local bus stations. <b>The</b> <b>long-distance</b> services connect Tawau to Lahad Datu, Sandakan, Telupid, Ranau, Simpang Sapi, Kundasang, Kota Kinabalu, Sipitang, Beaufort, Papar and Simpang Ranau. The short-distance services connect to destinations including as Sandakan and Semporna.|$|E
5|$|Regular bus {{services}} with minivans and taxis {{also can be}} found. There are three bus terminals operating in the town such as the Buses to Sepilok, Local Bus Terminal and the Long Distance Bus Terminal. <b>The</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus terminal is located about 4km north of the town while the local bus connects with {{the centre of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Friedrichstraße {{station was}} rebuilt; <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> {{section of the}} station was {{expanded}} to four tracks and the current station hall was built. Between 1922 and 1932, the Stadtbahn viaduct was thoroughly modernised in order to handle the ever-increasing train weight. Also, the train sheds of Alexanderplatz and Schlesischer Bahnhof were replaced. The suburban line's platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres.|$|E

5|$|Miri {{city has}} 2 bus {{stations}}, namely the local (located at Melayu Road next to Tamu Muhibbah and Visitor's Information Centre) and long-distance bus stations (located near Pujut Corner). The local bus station serves the Miri city area, Bakam area, Miri Airport, and Brunei. Buses to Niah National Park, Lambir Hills National Park, Bintulu, Sibu, Kuching, and Pontianak, Indonesia depart from <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> bus station. Local taxi services are also {{provided in the}} city with the main taxi stand at China Road in the city centre. Taxis here do not use meters.|$|E
5|$|O'Dell {{set about}} {{contacting}} local musicians from the Harrisons' rented house in Nichols Canyon, as Harrison took <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> calls, hoping {{more than anything}} to secure Bob Dylan's participation. Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good time in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Most fungi lack an {{efficient}} system for <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> {{transport of water}} and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 1928 the {{suburban}} line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner was fully equipped with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type appropriately named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were fully electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became fully operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services.|$|E
5|$|The main {{railway station}} in Aarhus is Aarhus Central Station {{located in the}} city centre. DSB has {{connections}} to destinations throughout Denmark and beyond. Two local railways provide commuter services to Grenaa and Odder. The Aarhus Letbane is a planned electric tram-train system that will link two railway lines with a new light rail route through the city. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Allé or Banegårdspladsen, or both. Regional and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal, {{just east of the}} central station. <b>The</b> <b>long-distance</b> buses of linie888 connect Aarhus to other cities in Jutland and Zealand.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} inaugural {{run of the}} RTLs {{took place}} on September 18–19, 1976. Regular service on the Empire Corridor began on September 20. Initially, the two trainsets were mostly confined to the New York–Albany shuttle, with a single round-trip each on Saturday and Sunday to Buffalo. The New York–Montreal Adirondack received Turboliners on March 1, 1977, replacing conventional equipment. By April 1977, Turboliners had displaced conventional equipment on most routes in upstate New York. Exceptions included some New York–Albany trains, as well as <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> Lake Shore Limited and Niagara Rainbow. In 1989, after 12 years of operation, {{the availability of the}} fleet was at 90%.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{modes of}} transportation are bullock carts. It is recorded that {{as late as}} the 1950s, landlords and rich farmers travelled mostly by bullock carts with the exception of rare long journeys which they undertook by buses or motor vehicles. Kumbakonam has an efficient local bus transportation system. The mofussil bus stand is located in the south-east of Kumbakonam and is situated just opposite to the Arignar Anna Bus Stand where <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> buses are stationed. There are occasional ferries that transport people and goods across the Cauvery. Till the beginning of the 20th century, students of the Government Arts College used to cross the Cauvery on coracle ferries in order to attend college. Since the construction of a bridge in 1944, the practice of transporting men and goods by coracles has greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Telemark County Municipality had {{attempted}} to create a PSO contract for {{the operation of the}} Bratsberg Line, that had been transferred from the state to the county. Five private companies had bid, but all five had been disqualified and the county was forced to sign a concession contract with NSB instead, despite NSB not having bid in the tender. The same year, the national process was delayed one year. However, the government announced that the bidding would happen in three stages; first the Gjøvik Line and Bergen Commuter Rail, second <b>the</b> <b>long-distance</b> trains as well as the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and finally the rest of the Oslo Commuter Rail, as well as the Jæren Commuter Rail. Among the challenges was the ownership of the rolling stock and depots. The department considered creating a separate government-owned company that would own these. Since NSB had been converted to a limited company, it would be necessary for the state to purchase the trains and depots for full price from NSB. With 69 multiple units delivered within the past five years, this could become an expensive transaction for the state. An alternative was launched were NSB would have to lease locomotives, carriages and multiple units to the winner, and also sell tickets for them at railway stations, a solution that was later chosen. In September 2004, it was announced that current employees working for NSB along the Gjøvik Line would have the right to work for the winner, and could demand the same wage and pension rights as before.|$|E
