5|$|Another early {{application}} of functional graphs {{is in the}} trains used to study Steiner triple systems. The train of a triple system is a functional graph having a vertex for each possible triple of symbols; each triple pqr is mapped by ƒ to stu, where pqs, prt, and qru are the triples that belong to the triple system and contain the pairs pq, pr, and qr respectively. Trains have been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> invariant of triple systems although somewhat cumbersome to compute.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{and prosperous}} {{political}} center, kings held {{the title of}} Lugal, and many are attested in the city, {{but the most important}} source is the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla, and in it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements. However, the reading of this letter is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.|$|E

5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones. She eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help for the greater good. Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels.|$|E
5|$|The current Raglan Castle {{was begun}} by Sir William ap Thomas, the lesser {{son of a}} minor Welsh family who rose {{through the ranks of}} mid-15th century politics, {{profiting}} from the benefits of the local offices he held. William married first Elizabeth, a wealthy heiress, and then Gwladus ap Thomas, another heiress who would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> regional figure in her own right. In 1432 William purchased the manor of Raglan, where he had already been staying as a tenant, for 1,000 marks (£666) and commenced a programme of building work that established the basic shape of the castle as seen today, although most of it— {{with the exception of the}} South Gate and the Great Tower— was later built over.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{policy was}} put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, {{which was in}} opposition for all but {{two years of the}} 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.|$|E

40|$|Transformation optics (<b>TO)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{tool for}} the design of artiffcial {{materials}} with unprecedented optical properties. Here, we propose the approximation of TO structures of arbitrary shape by faceting, in which curved surfaces are approximated by at metamaterial layers that can be implemented by standard fabrication and stacking techniques. We illustrate the approximation approach for the specific example of a cylindrical invisibility cloak. First, we introduce a numerical method {{for the design of}} cloaks with arbitrary boundary shapes, and apply it to faceted shapes. Subsequently, we reduce the complexity of the metamaterials needed to implement the perfect faceted cloak by introducing several approximations, whose validity <b>is</b> quantified by <b>an</b> investigation of the scattering cross section.

25|$|Beyond {{the mostly}} {{accepted}} {{terms of the}} Armenian nationalism as given in the above paragraphs, the concept has come to include a range of interpretations of Prehistoric Armenia, including the link to the Iron Age kingdom of Urartu. The Armenians are the original inhabitants of the territory of what is named as historic Armenia. Identification with the distant glories of Urartu and its prehistoric forerunners, together with Mount Ararat has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> symbol of Armenian ethnicity especially among the diaspora.|$|E
25|$|Cienfuegos port, {{despite being}} one of the latest {{settlements}} established during the colonial era, soon grew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> town due to the fertile fields surrounding it and its position on the trade route between Jamaica and South American cities to the southeast and the hinterland provincial capital of Santa Clara to the northeast. Its advantageous trading location on the historically eponymous Bay of Jagua was used by the Cuban sugar oligarchy when a railroad was built between both cities between 1853 and 1860.|$|E
25|$|Community {{volunteer}} work has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> predictor in students' academic lives and college {{experience as a}} whole.

25|$|Although Arakan {{had been}} de facto {{independent}} {{since the late}} Pagan period, the Laungkyet dynasty of Arakan was ineffectual.

Mrauk-U went on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> kingdom in its own right between 15th and 17th centuries, including East Bengal between 1459 and 1666.

25|$|On 15 March, Gorbachev {{himself was}} elected {{as the first}} — and as it turned out, only — President of the Soviet Union by the Congress of People's Deputies and chose a Presidential Council of 15 politicians.

The new Executive was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> position to guide the spiraling reform process, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Congress of People's Deputies had already given Gorbachev increasingly presidential powers in February. This was again criticized by reformers. Despite the apparent increase in Gorbachev's power, {{he was unable to}} stop the process of nationalistic assertion.|$|E
25|$|Grapefruit seed extract {{has been}} {{advocated}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> antimicrobial with proven activity against bacteria and fungi. However, independent {{studies have shown}} the efficacy of grapefruit seed extract as an antimicrobial is not demonstrated. Although citrus seed extract is {{claimed to be a}} highly effective plant-based preservative by some natural personal care manufacturers, studies asserted that the universal antimicrobial benefits associated with GSE are merely from the presence of synthetic preservatives. Natural GSE has no antimicrobial properties. Newer studies found many commercial grapefruit seed extracts contaminated with synthetic preservatives. In a 2007 study the main synthetic antimicrobial agent identified in commercial GSE samples was benzethonium chloride. In a 2008 study synthetic disinfectants such as benzethonium or benzalkonium chloride were identified in most of the commercial GSE products. In a 2008 study suspected counterfeit products were determined to contain benzethonium chloride in grapefruit seed extract samples.|$|E
