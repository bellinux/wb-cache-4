500|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, competitors of the American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> trust used a different approach to gain a technological advantage. The machines used by American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> replaced glass blowers, but still used the same blowing and cutting process used in the 1880s—although the company was constantly working to make the process more efficient. Competitors such as American inventor Irving W. Colburn began working on a machine that produced <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> using a different process. Colburn patented his work during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century. Although he filed for bankruptcy in 1912, his patents were purchased by Edward Drummond Libbey and Michael J. Owens—who hired Colburn to continue work on the machine. [...] Owens was the creator of the Owens Bottling Machine that revolutionized the glass bottle industry. [...] Working with Colburn, Owens improved the <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> machine enough that it began being used for production in 1921. By 1926, Libbey-Owens had gained a <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> market share of 29 percent, while American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass's</b> share was 59 percent. During the 1920s, Pittsburgh Plate Glass also developed a new process for making <b>window</b> <b>glass,</b> creating even more competition in the <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> industry.|$|R

500|$|During {{the spring}} of 1900, rumors {{circulated}} that American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> planned to move production from smaller plants in nearby Dunkirk and Redkey (factories 17, 30, 34, and 41) to the large southside Hartford City plant. If the Hartford City plant would have its capacity expanded equal to {{the capacity of the}} plants to be consolidated, then Hartford City would have [...] "become the greatest <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> town in the world." [...] The plant would have employed nearly 1000 people, equaling the largest <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> plant in the world in capacity. That plant in combination with Hartford City's two other <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> factories, not even considering the flint glass plants or bottle plants, would make the city's <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> capacity the highest in the world.

[...] In 1913, the company continued to close many of its smaller plants, while the large plants were equipped with the glass blowing machines. Plant number 3 was the third largest <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> factory in the United States, and the largest west of Pennsylvania. [...] The Belgian portion of Hartford City's glassmaking workforce was dramatically reduced because of two factors: [...] the glass-blowing machine replaced human glass blowers; and Belgians had difficulty returning from summer vacations in their European homeland after the start of World War I.|$|R

500|$|The trust was {{incorporated}} effective August 2, 1899. James A. Chambers continued as president, and Hartford City’s H.B. Smith {{was one of}} the directors of the newly incorporated company. [...] Initial acquisitions included over 20 major <b>window</b> <b>glass</b> plants, including Hartford City Glass Company. Most of the original acquisitions were from Indiana and Pennsylvania.

500|$|Because of the {{improved}} technology and processes utilized by competitors, {{many of the}} American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> patents, and much of its machinery, became obsolete. By the late 1920s, American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> was forced to begin re-equipping its plants with new machinery. The company underwent a financial reorganization in 1929. Dividends on its preferred stock were lowered. Although a few plants were re-equipped, the Hartford City plant was not. [...] Hartford City's natural gas supply was depleted, {{and the type of}} sand used to produce glass was in better supply near other American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> plants in Pennsylvania. Thus, American <b>Window</b> <b>Glass</b> Company plant number 3, the former Hartford City Glass Company, was closed in 1929.|$|R
