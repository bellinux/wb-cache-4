40|$|A digital {{ticket is}} a {{certificate}} that guarantees certain {{rights of the}} ticket owner. There are many applications for digital tickets but the ticket properties {{vary depending on the}} application. This variety makes the digital <b>ticket</b> <b>processing</b> system expensive, especially if dedicated systems must be developed for each application. This paper thus addresses issues on developing a common data schema and processing architecture for various types of digital tickets. This paper clarifies requirements for a general-purpose digital ticket and shows four features in contrast to digital cash: 1) parameterization of ticket properties on anonymity, transferability, and divisibility; 2) machineunderstandability of ticket contents; 3) statetransitionality of ticket status; and 4) composability of multiple tickets.

40|$|The focus lies on {{recommendations}} for policy makers {{in connection with}} the “enforcement chain” concept. In particular with automated enforcement (e. g. speed and red light cameras) this chain concept is crucial: if one link is not effective or efficient, enforcement is compromised and road safety is negatively affected. The automated enforcement chain consists of a dozen links from detection and measurement to fine collection and/or court proceedings. It also includes basic issues such as vehicle registration and readability of license plates. Many counties struggle to get the wide range of multi-disciplinary aspects of the enforcement chain right and are thus not able to optimise their enforcement and improve road safety. Key bottlenecks in the automated enforcement chain can be found e. g. when the legal and operational framework and its capacity are not in place for dealing with automated traffic enforcement and the resulting huge volumes of traffic violations the license plate/vehicle owner and/or driving license administration are not in order inadequate requirements for the legal integrity of evidence and equipment homologation <b>ticket</b> <b>processing,</b> issuance and fine collection are ineffective and inefficient authorities argue over ticket revenue and funding of road safety investments e. g. enforcement equipment political and administrative support for automated traffic enforcement are wavering public support suffers because the background, results and road safety benefits of enforcement are not properly communicated through various media...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Maximal {{automation}} {{of routine}} IT maintenance procedures is an {{ultimate goal of}} IT service management. System monitoring, an effective and reliable means for IT problem detection, generates monitoring tickets to be processed by system administrators. IT problems are naturally organized in a hierarchy by specialization. The problem hierarchy is used to help triage <b>tickets</b> to the <b>processing</b> team for problem resolving. In this paper, a hierarchical multi-label classification method is proposed to classify the monitoring tickets by utilizing the problem hierarchy. In order {{to find the most}} effective classification, a novel contextual hierarchy (CH) loss is introduced in accordance with the problem hierarchy. Consequently, an arising optimization problem is solved by a new greedy algorithm. An extensive empirical study over ticket data was conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

40|$|More than ever, {{businesses}} heavily rely on IT {{service delivery}} {{to meet their}} current and frequently changing business requirements. Optimizing the quality of service delivery improves customer satisfaction {{and continues to be}} a critical driver for business growth. The routine maintenance procedure plays a key function in IT service management, which typically involves problem detection, determination and resolution for the service infrastructure. Many IT Service Providers adopt partial automation for incident diagnosis and resolution where the operation of the system administrators and automation operation are intertwined. Often the system administrators 2 ̆ 7 roles are limited to helping triage <b>tickets</b> to the <b>processing</b> teams for problem resolving. The processing teams are responsible to perform a complex root cause analysis, providing the system statistics, event and ticket data. A large scale of system statistics, event and ticket data aggravate the burden of problem diagnosis on both the system administrators and the processing teams during routine maintenance procedures. Alleviating human efforts involved in IT service management dictates intelligent and efficient solutions to maximize the automation of routine maintenance procedures. Three research directions are identified and considered to be helpful for IT service management optimization: (1) Automatically determine problem categories according to the symptom description in a ticket; (2) Intelligently discover interesting temporal patterns from system events; (3) Instantly identify temporal dependencies among system performance statistics data. Provided with ticket, event, and system performance statistics data, the three directions can be effectively addressed with a data-driven solution. The quality of IT service delivery can be improved in an efficient and effective way. The dissertation addresses the research topics outlined above. Concretely, we design and develop data-driven solutions to help system administrators better manage the system and alleviate the human efforts involved in IT Service management, including (1) a knowledge guided hierarchical multi-label classification method for IT problem category determination based on both the symptom description in a ticket and the domain knowledge from the system administrators; (2) an efficient expectation maximization approach for temporal event pattern discovery based on a parametric model; (3) an online inference on time-varying temporal dependency discovery from large-scale time series data...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) is a significant issue in today's tourism industry. The development of the internet has made information easily accessible to consumers, and has therefore established a direct link between consumers and suppliers. As a result, traditional travel distribution channels are changing rapidly. A major feature of this change is "disintermediation", with principals such as airlines, hotels and rental car chains bypassing intermediaries and sell directly to consumers. Travel agents (TAs) are considered to be particularly vulnerable to this process. ICTs have the potential to replace their core competencies, which include transaction <b>processing</b> (<b>ticketing</b> and settlement) and information provision (raw product information provided by suppliers). This thesis focuses on the impact of ICTs on the TA sector, and specifically on the New Zealand TA case. A theoretical approach based on regulation theory combined with a mixed method approach was used to investigate the main issues in New Zealand. The research included a case study to identify the principal issues and trends in the TA sector, in-depth interviews with TAs and industry specialists to refine the main issues and allow the formulation of some theoretical assumptions, in-depth interviews with consumers regarding the role of TAs in the internet era and the quality of service they provide, and a fully-structured, national on-line survey of TAs to verify the assumptions made in the earlier interviews and test the applicability of the post-Fordism model for the New Zealand TA sector. Based on the findings, it is argued that disintermediation is particularly pronounced in the relationship between airlines and travel agents. To minimise the risk of disintermediation and improve business performance, TAs need to reposition themselves and review their core strategies to compete efficiently in the changing business environment. The thesis reveals that consumers perceive TAs as mainly "transaction facilitators". Nevertheless the thesis show that process of "reintermediation" is a reality for some New Zealand TAs. An application of regulation theory to the New Zealand TA case reveals that in its traditional form, the regulation theory cannot explain the complexities found in the modern TA environment. The thesis reveals several distinct modes in TA perceptions of their business environment and their survival strategies, which indicates a heterogeneous, clustered population. A "formula for success" is developed for TAs in New Zealand. In this respect, TAs that perceive ICT as a strategic tool and are orientated towards consumers appear to have a business advantage...|$|R
