Phototaxis index (Ip), mobilization inhibition percentage (MIP) and mortality percentage (MP) were used as test endpoints for toxicity assessment. The results show that Cu and Cd were the dominant toxicants that affected the D. carinata in the test solutions. However, the contribution of nitrogen, relative to other components, to the overall toxicity to D. carinata could increase over time. It was found that three toxicity parameters (i. e.

The results show that D. carinata had advantages over other cladoceran species for {{being used as a}} test organism, particularly for ecotoxicological assessment of aquatic environments in tropical and subtropical areas. D. carinata had similar body size and total number of offspring per female to D. magna. However, D. carinata was more sensitive to the reference toxicant and had much shorter reproduction cycle than D. magna. D. carinata had similarity to D. pulex, C. quadrangular, S. vetulus and B. longirostris in terms of sensitivity to the reference toxicant and length of reproduction cycle. However, D. carinata was much larger in size and produced much more offspring per female than any of D. pulex, C. quadrangular, S. vetulus and B. longirostris. Among the investigated cladocerans, only the neonates (2 - and 4 -day-old) of D. carinata exhibited phototaxis that was sufficiently remarkable. The low among-generation variation in phototaxis index (Ip) of D. carinata and the close relationship between Ip and the concentration of the ISO standard toxicant (K 2 Cr 2 O 7) appears to suggest that Ip can be used as an excellent <b>test</b> <b>endpoint</b> for ecotoxicity testing...|$|E

We also tested the acute and sublethal responses of a mayfly (Baetis tricaudatus) and a midge (Chironomus dilutus, formerly C. tentans) with Pb. We examine the statistical interpretation of test endpoints and the acute-to-chronic ratio concept. Increasing the number of control replicates by 2 to 3 × decreased the minimum detectable differences by almost half. Pb ACR estimates mostly increased with increasing acute resistance of the organisms (rainbow trout ACRs < ≈ mayfly < Chironomus). The choice of <b>test</b> <b>endpoint</b> and statistical analysis influenced ACR estimates by up to a factor of four. When calculated using the geometric means of the no- and lowest-observed effect concentrations, ACRs with rainbow trout and Cd were 0. 6 and 0. 95; Zn about 1. 0; and for Pb 3. 3 and 11. The comparable Pb ACRs for the mayfly and Chironomus were 5. 2 and 51 respectively. Our rainbow trout ACRs with Pb were about 5 – 20 × lower than earlier reports with salmonids.

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{problems}} of ecological risk assessment is modeling the relationship between <b>test</b> <b>endpoints</b> (numerical summaries {{of the results of}} toxicity <b>tests)</b> and assessment <b>endpoints</b> (formal expressions of the properties of the environment that are to be protected). For example, one may wish to estimate the reduction in species richness of fishes in a stream reach exposed to an effluent and have only a fathead minnow 96 hr LC 50 as an effects metric. The problem is to extrapolate from what is known (the fathead minnow LC 50) to what matters to the decision maker, the loss of fish species. Models used for this purpose may be termed Effects Extrapolation Models (EEMs) or Activity-Activity Relationships (AARs), by analogy to Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs).

An international ring-test was performed to evaluate the precision of the test method. Four sediments (artificial, natural) were tested. Test duration was 10 d, and <b>test</b> <b>endpoint</b> was inhibition of growth rate (r) based on fresh weight data. Eighteen of 21 laboratories met the validity criterion of r = 0. 09 d(- 1) in the control. Results from 4 tests that did not conform to test-performance criteria were excluded from statistical evaluation. The inter-laboratory variability of growth rates (20. 6 %- 25. 0 %) and inhibition (26. 6 %- 39. 9 %) was comparable with the variability of other standardized bioassays. The mean test-internal variability of the controls was low (7 % [control], 9. 7 % [solvent control]), yielding a high discriminatory power of the given test design (median minimum detectable differences [MDD] 13 % to 15 %). To ensure these MDDs, an additional validity criterion of CV = 15 % of the growth rate in the controls was recommended.

Copper deficiency has been associated with disease states that decrease commercial beef production. Clinical manifestations of copper disease include anemia, diarrhea, long bone fractures, generalized ill-thrift, and decreased fertility. Recent studies have demonstrated that copper deficiency is common in North American beef cattle. This body of work addresses diagnosis, epidemiology and the immunologic consequences of copper deficiency in calves. For serum copper concentration of 0. 45 microgram/gram as a <b>test</b> <b>endpoint,</b> serum copper concentration had sensitivity of 0. 53 and specificity of 0. 89 for detection of low liver copper concentration. A number of management factors were significantly associated with either serum copper concentration or copper status. The relationship between geographic areas of copper deficiency occurrence and the state's two major rivers, the Missouri and Mississippi, was the most intriguing factor identified. The true influence of these rivers could not be determined with this study, but it warrants further investigation. The binomial distribution was used to calculate the probability of k positive test results in n trials at varying prevalences. This process provided a de facto hypothesis test for the lower 95 % confidence limit of prevalence. The binomial model provided a more satisfactory method to interpret imperfect test results than the z-distribution for population proportions. In relation to copper supplementation there were no statistically significant differences in the immunologic parameters studied. This however, may not represent the true benefit copper supplementation may have on copper deficient calves...|$|E

This test method was evaluated with the dung beetle Aphodius constans by using fecal residues of ivermectin after a pour-on administration. Dung of different age (and thus containing different concentrations of ivermectin) as well as mixtures of highly-contaminated spiked dung with untreated control dung were studied in five test runs in two laboratories. The concentration of ivermectin (active substance; a. s.) in the dung samples was verified analytically. The main <b>test</b> <b>endpoint</b> was the survival of first instar larvae. The LC_ 50 using dung directly obtained from treated cattle ranged from 470 to 692  μ g a. s.  kg^- 1 dung (dry weight; d. w.) and 67 to 97  μ g a. s.  kg^- 1 dung (fresh weight; f. w.). Using mixtures, the outcome of two tests was almost identical: 770 to 781  μ g a. s.  kg^- 1 dung (d. w.); 109 to 132  μ g a. s.  kg^- 1 dung (f. w.). In comparison to the LC_ 50 values obtained when ivermectin was spiked in control dung at several concentrations (LC_ 50 880 - 985  μ g a. s.  kg^- 1 dung (d. w.)), the LC_ 50 values were again very similar. Three conclusions {{can be drawn from}} these results. The proposed test method seems to be robust and allows for the initiation of an international validation process (including ringtesting). Because of only small differences found in tests in which the test substance was spiked into control dung and those in which dung from treated cattle was applied, the use of a standard test method is proposed. The effects of ivermectin on ecologically relevant dung beetles obtained in a standardised test method reflect the results from field studies and are in the range of environmentally relevant concentrations...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} backlog in the testing of new chemical compounds for their ecotoxic properties, mostly {{due to the lack}} of appropriate testing methods. In addition, there is a vivid debate today about the <b>test</b> <b>endpoint</b> for many of the existing methods. This thesis describes the Microbial Assay for Risk Assessment, MARA, a new method for ecological risk assessment and toxicity testing. MARA is based on the simultaneous exposure of eleven microbial strains to a concentration gradient of the chemical compound to be tested. The eleven strains have been selected so that different strains exhibit different sensitivities to chemicals. A growth inhibition pattern - the toxic fingerprint - can be thus detected on the microplate in which the test is performed. The toxic fingerprint, rather than the eleven individual growth inhibitory concentrations, is the result from the test. It can be compared to toxic fingerprints from other tested chemicals in a database and thereby generate more information regarding the type of toxic effect and species specificity of the tested compound than a singlevalue result would. The toxic fingerprint for two groups of chemicals, disinfectants and chlorophenols, were compared. It was concluded that MARA can differentiate between different types of toxic effects and also between chemicals with similar molecular structure. MARA is comparable to other bacteria based tests both regarding sensitivity and reproducibility. The toxic fingerprint is heavily dependent on the selection of the strains on which the assay is based. They must give a diversified answer to large groups of chemicals, and as bacteria have a larger genetic diversity than higher organisms, it would plausibly be advantageous with a high genetic diversity among the strains. It was shown that the strains should preferably belong to different genera, but not necessarily to different phyla, to yield the most differentiated response to different chemicals. In order to make MARA as user-friendly as possible, a new method for detection of microbial growth/inhibition of growth in microplates using a flat-bed scanner was developed. The results obtained with the scanner were highly correlated to results obtained with a spectrophotometer, the classical device used for instant quantification of microbial growth, when using TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, tetrazolium red) or MTT (chelating tetrazole) as growth indicators...|$|E

Zinc deficiency resulted in a lower zinc tolerance, a higher coefficient of variation for brood size, and an increased pH sensitivity. These results clearly indicate that (background) zinc concentrations present in test and culture media have to be considered in the evaluation of toxicity test results, especially when the toxicity data are used for water-quality guideline derivation and/or ecological risk assessment.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present a {{short-term}} plankton community toxicity test in laboratory microcosms, with which {{the effect of the}} test substance on species abundance and composition of the community is evaluated. This laboratory microcosm is an intermediate between single-species tests and outdoor mesocosm tests. The brominated flame retardant HBCDD was chosen as the reoccurring test substance in three experiments. It was applied at similar nominal exposure concentrations in toxicity experiments performed in test systems with different grades of complexity. One experiment was performed in an outdoor artificial pond in which cylinders were inserted to isolate replicate mesocosms. The other experiments were performed in a greenhouse environment in 10 L microcosms with sediment and water from a eutrophic lake and brackish water estuary. The short-time plankton community toxicity test proposed in this work was successful in detecting structural changes in plankton community composition due to exposure to anthropogenic chemicals. Several prerequisites for a sensitive community toxicity test were fulfilled. Ecological interactions, like competition and predation, were present and made detection of community level responses like secondary effects possible. The community which developed in the 10 L microcosms included many plankton species. This is important for a sensitive and representative evaluation of the toxic effect. The rich plankton community and a maintained balance between the autotroph and heterotroph communities {{during the course of the}} experiment were possible due to the sediment compartment. The sediment acts as a seed-bank from which plankton continuously hatch and enter the water volume. Lake water inoculation did not increase the species richness and made no change in plankton community composition. Using artificial water decreases both work-load and costs, considerably. Another important issue in the evaluation of toxicity tests is the variance of <b>test</b> <b>endpoints</b> between replicates. The minimal detectable difference from control (MDD) which mirrors the variability of <b>test</b> <b>endpoints</b> was compared between the mesocosm experiment and the two microcosm experiments. The three lowest MDD values were more or less in the same range between the experiments and ranged between 5 - 39 %. A possible increase in MDD was observed with increased experimental duration. An exposure period of 7 days is considered optimal in detecting clear community level responses at a minimum time. The effects of the test compounds in the three experiments were evaluated with population level and community level metrics. Judging from the results, no single toxic endpoint was found to be the most sensitive one. This stresses the importance of analysing both community and population metrics...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to provide DOE with improved methods to assess risks from contaminants to wildlife populations. The current approach for wildlife risk assessment consists of comparison of contaminant exposure estimates for individual animals to literature-derived toxicity <b>test</b> <b>endpoints.</b> These <b>test</b> <b>endpoints</b> are assumed to estimate thresholds for population-level effects. For several reasons, uncertainties associated with this approach are considerable. First, because toxicity data are not available for most potential wildlife endpoint species, extrapolation of toxicity data from test species to the species of interest is required. There is no consensus on the most appropriate extrapolation method. Second, toxicity data are represented as statistical measures (e. g., NOAELs or LOAELs) that provide no information on the nature or magnitude of effects. The level of effect is an artifact of the replication and dosing regime employed, and does not indicate how effects might increase with increasing exposure. Consequently, slight exceedance of a LOAEL is not distinguished from greatly exceeding it. Third, the relationship of toxic effects on individuals to effects on populations is poorly estimated by existing methods. It is assumed that if the exposure of individuals exceeds levels associated with impaired reproduction, then population level effects are likely. Uncertainty associated with this assumption is large because depending on the reproductive strategy of a given species, comparable levels of reproductive impairment may result in dramatically different population-level responses. The authors are working on several tasks to address these problems: (1) investigation {{of the validity of}} the current allometric scaling approach for interspecies extrapolation and development of new scaling models; (2) development of dose-response models for toxicity data presented in the literature; and (3) development of matrix-based population models that, coupled with dose-response models, will allow for realistic estimation of population-level effects for individual responses. Uncertainties associated with the current approach to wildlife risk assessment may have direct impacts on DOE EM satisfactorily fulfilling it''s mission in two ways. First, risk estimates may be too conservative and therefore remediation may be recommended when it is not needed. Limited remediation funds may be spent for insignificant or non-existent risks and possibly cause a net increase in environmental damage due to unnecessary habitat destruction. Second, risk estimates may not be adequately protective and therefore remedial actions may not recommended when they are needed. The consequences of this uncertainty is environmental damage and potential NRDA liability. Either of these alternatives results in inefficient use of limited EM funds. This project will provide the tools to better estimate population-level effects and therefore reduce uncertainty associated with wildlife risk assessments. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{polycyclic}} musks (PCMs), 7 -acetyl- 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6 -hexamethyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphtha-lene (AHTN) and 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -hexahydro- 4, 6, 6, 7, 8 -hexamethylcyclopenta-γ- 2 -benzopyran (HHCB), {{are widely}} used as fragrance compounds in laundry detergents, soaps and cosmetics. To assess the potential toxicological effects associated with AHTN and HHCB, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) {{was used as a}} model organism for eco-toxicity testing. We examined acute toxicity using 50 % lethal concentrations (LC 50) after 24 hr PCM exposure and also examined changes in the <b>test</b> <b>endpoints</b> of growth and maturation such as body length, percentage of gravid worms and fecundity. The LC 50 for C. elegans was found to be more than 255. 2 mg/l for AHTN and 194. 6 mg/l for HHCB. In growth tests, the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) in C. elegans for AHTN and HHCB were 12. 8 mg/l and 9. 8 mg/l, respectively. In maturation tests, LOECs were estimated at 6. 4 mg/l for AHTN and 9. 8 mg/l for HHCB. In reproduction tests, while maximum LOECs of 19. 5 mg/l were observed for HHCB, concentrations of more than 25. 5 mg/l were obtained for AHTN...|$|R
