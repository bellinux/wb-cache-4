5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee, or repeated minor <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to the affected area. Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>The</b> EBM for <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{thoracic}} lumbar spine specifies {{the necessity}} of intervention within 24 h of the trauma with a stabilization intervention when the lesion requires a surgical intervention. The Traumatologist working in a structure without a Spinal Unit must be able <b>to</b> evaluate <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vertebral column in the Emergency Room and decide whether to direct them toward a conservative treatment or surgery. Materials and methods: Six doctors in specialized training for Orthopedics and Traumatology at the A. O. U. SENESE of Siena, five doctors specializing in Orthopedics and Traumatology at the Klinical Center of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and five Orthopedics at the Val d’Elsa hospital were presented 24 clinical cases where the following details were indicated: patient age, neurological conditions, description of the injury mechanism and imaging results. The 24 cases were chosen from the literature based on {{the frequency with which}} they may present themselves before Traumatologists. The evaluation criteria of excellence indicated for statistics were: the correct arrangement of the dynamics of the event, description of the radiological picture, the TLISS Score, and the correlation of therapy with those reported in the literature. The statistical methods used were the statistical significance, the reliability (P< 0. 05), the validity of the decision, the percentage of accuracy, and the Cohen K. Results: The best results when evaluating the fracture mechanism were demonstrated by the Orthopedic Hospital with an accuracy of 78. 8...|$|R

5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neck, {{such as a}} blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Chronic {{traumatic}} encephalopathy (CTE) {{was initially}} described in boxers, {{but in recent}} years it has been reported in other settings, particularly in contact sports and military personnel. Soccer (football association) had previously been (and still is) considered relatively safe when compared to other sports, such as American football. However, a few cases of professional soccer players with CTE {{have been reported in the}} last few years. It is still unknown how frequent this condition is in soccer players, and the role played by heading the ball remains elusive. Other <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, face and neck caused by contact with another player's head, arm or other body parts are among the most frequent in soccer. In spite of the lack of more in-depth knowledge, there is reasonable evidence for recommending severe punishment (red card and suspension for several matches) for players causing avoidable <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> another player's head...|$|R

5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E

The other group was Fabio Gallazzi, his wife, Tiziana Pedroni, and his son, Giacomo Gallazzi. The pilot of the helicopter was New Zealander Jeremy Clarke, who had logged 2,700 hours as a helicopter pilot. All recovered victims died from blunt <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head, torso and extremities, according to the NYC medical examiner's office.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{color of the}} Namib Desert Horse is bay, {{although}} {{there are a few}} chestnut and brown horses. The gene for gray does not occur in the breed. There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes. No other colors have been recorded. The Namib Desert Horses are athletic, muscular, , and strong boned. They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses in head, skin, and coat. Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to <b>trauma</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E

40|$|Besides {{surgical}} technique related variables, post-operative care after nipple reconstruction with CV flaps {{is important for}} an satisfactory final result. We present a novel method to prepare a protective and sealing medication in order <b>to</b> minimize <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new nipple. We found the silicone cap plunger of a 50 cc syringe suitable for our purpose. It was applied over a non-adherent dressing and TNT gauze to avoid decubitus and fixed it with a steri-strip before covering with a sticking plaster. Analyzing 118 nipples casistic, reconstructed with a CV flaps technique, between January 2011 and June 2012 and medicated with the presented technique {{in the last six}} months considered, we noticed a reduction in partial loss of flap vitality and nipple reabsorption. The main advantages of the dressing technique we propose are the ease and rapidity in the preparation and availability of all materials used in every operation room or outpatient clinic. We believe that our technique of medication may reduce <b>traumas</b> <b>to</b> delicate vascularization of the new nipple, avoiding the partial or total loss of vitality and reabsorption of the flaps...|$|R
