25|$|Fremantle had destroyers tow sinking ships ashore {{and beach}} them, while {{boarding}} parties attempted {{to reverse the}} scuttling or order the Germans aboard to do so. Those Germans who abandoned ship were picked up. Reuter was brought aboard Fremantle's flagship, , where he and Fremantle engaged in a brief argument {{with the aid of}} an interpreter. The following day, Fremantle assembled Reuter and his officers on the deck of Revenge, and <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter</b> informed them of their breaches 'of faith and honour' and accused them of recommencing hostilities by sinking their ships.

He then took the commander from that tower to another tower to persuade its garrison too to surrender. The garrison did surrender and Staines had both towers blown up. He then captured and destroyed a third tower, all without any casualties to Cyane.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often {{takes the form of}} an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter</b> or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can {{play a critical role in}} the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{was in high}} demand. A {{parish in}} Scotland could have been procured, and he was called to a Virginia church. He {{declined}} both, to become in 1751, pastor {{of the church in}} Stockbridge, Massachusetts and a missionary to the Housatonic Indians, taking over for the recently deceased John Sergeant. To the Indians, he preached <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter,</b> and their interests he boldly and successfully defended by attacking the whites who were using their official positions among them to increase their private fortunes. During this time he got to know Judge Joseph Dwight who was Trustee of the Indian Schools. In Stockbridge, he wrote the Humble Relation, also called Reply to Williams (1752), which was an answer to Solomon Williams (1700–76), a relative and a bitter opponent of Edwards as to the qualifications for full communion. He there composed the treatises on which his reputation as a philosophical theologian chiefly rests, the essay on Original Sin, the Dissertation Concerning the Nature of True Virtue, the Dissertation Concerning the End for which God created the World, and the great work on the Will, written in four and a half months, and published in 1754 under the title, An Inquiry into the Modern Prevailing Notions Respecting that Freedom of the Will which is supposed to be Essential to Moral Agency.|$|E

On 4 July, the patrol returned to the Forrest River mission with some 30 Aboriginal men in chains, among them Lumbia, who, when questioned <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter,</b> confessed to having killed Hay. Over the following weeks several Aboriginal women attended the mission to have bullet wounds treated and it was claimed that the sister of another woman had been shot dead by the patrol and her baby bashed to death. In the months that followed, rumours circulated of a massacre by the police party. Attempts by the sergeant of police at Wyndham to investigate the rumours were met by refusals by those implicated to cooperate or answer claims they were involved. Rev. Gribble alleged that 30 {{men and women were}} missing who he suspected had been killed by the police party. Local Aborigines claimed up to 100 men women and children had been killed. Two years later Professor A. P. Elkin visited the area and estimated 20 had been killed.|$|E

500|$|On March 5, Martínez {{testified against}} Cisneros {{and told the}} jury that she ordered Fischer's murder. Martínez said that Cisneros told her to keep the plan a secret and that she wanted him [...] "good and dead". Speaking in Spanish <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter,</b> Martínez leaned forward in her seat and pointed at Cisneros, saying she told her exactly that.

One woman from San Antonio said that Martínez consulted her after she began having problems with her boyfriend and did not see positive results. Martínez denied knowing who the writers were, but changed her mind when the defense read the letters to her and the jury. She admitted that she used herbs, oils, and holy water in her sessions, and that she kept a human skull in her shop. She did not call herself a curandera (fortune teller) because she did not study for to earn the title. Martínez was then asked to read her cards for one of the attorney's in the courtroom to show the jury how she worked.|$|E

This meeting came about in August 2009, when Chomsky visited the Latin American country. In a press conference to commence the meeting, Chávez made reference to the intellectual's work, remarking [...] "Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival", before comparing Chomsky's thesis with the concept of [...] "Socialism or Barbarism" [...] advocated by German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 20th century. Speaking <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter,</b> Chomsky replied that [...] "I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that's easy.

[...] He went on to Venezolana de Televisión, where he commented on the U.S. government's role in orchestrating the 2009 Honduran coup d'état to overthrow leftist President Manuel Zelaya. He also expressed cautious support for the leftist reforms being implemented by Chávez's administration, remarking his opinion that their moves [...] "toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out".|$|E

Andrew Boyle, also of the 18th Royal Irish, spoke <b>through</b> <b>an</b> Irish <b>interpreter,</b> saying that the ladder was not removed because “persons below held on to it very tightly”.

2500|$|The defense {{produced}} 16 witnesses, all Italians from Plymouth, {{who testified}} {{that at the}} time of the attempted robbery they had bought eels from Vanzetti for the Christmas holiday, in accordance with their Christmas traditions. Such details reinforced the difference between the Italians and the jurors. Some testified in imperfect English, others <b>through</b> <b>an</b> <b>interpreter,</b> whose failure to speak the same dialect of Italian as the witnesses hampered his effectiveness. On cross examination, the prosecution found it easy to make the witnesses appear confused about dates. A boy who testified admitted to rehearsing his testimony.
