5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, a {{circular}} {{area with a}} radius of six miles (9.6km) from the summit was protected as a Forest Reserve. Areas encompassing the older volcanic remnants of Pouakai and Kaitake were later added to the reserve and in 1900 all this land was gazetted as Egmont National Park, the second national park in New Zealand. With intensively-farmed dairy pasture reaching {{right up to the}} mostly-circular park boundary, the change in vegetation is sharply delineated in satellite images. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the national Park where old growth forests are found.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, One by One won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, {{while one}} year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards [...] "All My Life" [...] {{was chosen as}} Best Hard Rock Performance. While the band had a {{positive}} opinion about the record following release, as Grohl said the songs were [...] "the best we've ever written", he {{and the rest of}} the Foo Fighters eventually grew distasteful about the results. Grohl stated that he was frustrated at himself for rushing on the album: [...] "four of the songs were good, and the other seven I've never played again in my life." [...] Hawkins said that [...] "if you think about things too much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there", and Shiflett declared that [...] "there are great songs , and then <b>there</b> <b>are...</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> great songs".|$|E

500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> {{its range}} where the common toad {{seems to be}} in decline. In Spain, {{increased}} aridity and habitat loss have led to a diminution in numbers and it is regarded as [...] "near threatened". [...] A population in the Sierra de Gredos mountain range is facing predation by otters and increased competition from the frog Pelophylax perezi. Both otter and frog seem to be extending their ranges to higher altitudes. The common toad cannot be legally sold or traded in the United Kingdom but there is a slow decline in toad numbers and it has therefore been declared a Biodiversity Action Plan priority species. In Russia, it {{is considered to be a}} [...] "Rare Species" [...] in the provinces of Bashkiria, Tataria, Yamal-Nenets Autonomous County and Irkutsk, but during the 1990s, it became more abundant in Moscow Province.|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Central Eurasia {{where the}} {{environment}} {{is considered to be}} stable over the past 40,000 years. In 2016 a study compared mDNA sequences of ancient wolf specimens with those from modern wolves, including specimens from the remote regions of North America, Russia, and China. One ancient haplotype that had once existed in both Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000YBP) and Russia (Medvezya [...] "Bear" [...] Cave, Pechora area, Northern Urals 18,000YBP) was shared by modern wolves found living in Mongolia and China (indicating a common maternal ancestor). The study found that the genetic diversity of past wolves was lost {{at the beginning of the}} Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe, and that there is limited overlap with modern wolves. The study did not support two wolf haplogroups that had been proposed by earlier studies. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model indicated by other studies, this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck (reduction) in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost at the beginning of the Holocene. In Eurasia, the loss of many ancient lineages cannot be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with reasons unclear.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than twenty}} {{different}} keyboards {{have been laid}} out, to suit local needs to match the standard keyboard for {{the country in which}} a laptop is intended. Around half of these have been manufactured for prototype machines. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the world which do not have a standard keyboard representing their language. As Negroponte states this is [...] "because there's no real commercial interest in making a keyboard". One example of where the OLPC has bridged this gap is in creating an Amharic keyboard for Ethiopia.|$|E
2500|$|While a {{political}} tone may be discerned in Nietzsche's writings, his work {{does not in}} any sense propose or outline a [...] "political project." [...] The man who stated that [...] "The will to a system {{is a lack of}} integrity" [...] was consistent in never devising or advocating a specific system of governance, enquiry, or ethics — just as, being an advocate of individual struggle and self-realization, he never concerned himself with mass movements or with the organization of groups and political parties [...] although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> his works where he considers an enigmatic [...] "greater politics", and others where he thinks the problem of community.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong has {{identified}} himself as bisexual, saying in a 1995 interview with The Advocate, [...] "I think I've always been bisexual. I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.' They say it's taboo. It's ingrained in our heads that it's bad, when it's not bad at all. It's a very beautiful thing." [...] In a later interview for Out magazine's April 2010 issue, Armstrong stated: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people who didn't accept it, who were homophobic." [...] Armstrong continued, saying, [...] "The fact that it's an issue is kind of phobic within itself. At some point, you gotta think, this should be something that's just accepted." [...] Armstrong added: [...] "I don't really classify myself as anything. And when it comes to sex, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> me that are very shy and conservative." [...] In February 2014, Armstrong again discussed his bisexuality in a Rolling Stone article about Dookie, a record which Armstrong described as [...] "touch on bisexuality a lot." [...] Armstrong discussed the song [...] "Coming Clean" [...] stating, [...] "It was a song about questioning myself. There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then. People are acting out what they're feeling: gay, bisexual, transgender, whatever. And that opens up something in society that becomes more acceptable. Now we have gay marriage becoming recognized... I think it's a process of discovery. I was willing to try anything." ...|$|E

60|$|To {{return to}} the {{theoretical}} distinction between fixed and circulating capital.

But this, though capital as to its destination, is not yet capital in actual exercise; it is not engaged in production, but has first to be sold or exchanged, that is, converted into an equivalent value of some other commodities, and therefore is not yet either fixed or circulating capital, but will become either one or the other, or be eventually divided between them.|$|E
