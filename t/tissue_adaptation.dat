He studied the relationship between dose and effect of preparations, the combined effect of medicaments, the influence of temperature on pharmacologic effect and <b>tissue</b> <b>adaptation</b> to poisons. He elaborated the teaching on the phasic effect of drugs, showing that this effect depended on {{the difference between the}} drug's concentration in the tissue and in the environment. Professor Kravkov was an ardent supporter of the idea of relationship between chemical composition of a substance and its pharmacologic effect. He found in particular that the narcotic effect of aliphatic spirits in the homologous sequence increases with the growth of the number of carbon atoms in their molecules, and that the effect of sugar on the heart depends on its stereo chemical structure. A comparative study of diverse soporifics conducted by Professor Kravkov resulted in materialization of his idea of aplying non-volatile somnifacients for general anesthesia. Thus, Professor Kravkov suggested application of Hedonal for intravenous anesthesia, which was immediately tested in clinics, and enjoys general recognition today. Professor Kravkov also suggested using Hedonal in combination with chloroform, which started application of so-called combined anesthesia with volatile and non-volatile or basic narcotics.|$|E

One decade ago, we studied transcapillary fluid balance and local <b>tissue</b> <b>adaptations</b> to high cardiovascular and musculoskeletal loads in adult and fetal giraffes. Previous studies by Goetz, Pattersson, Van Citters, Warren and their colleagues revealed that arterial pressure near the giraffe heart is about twice that in humans, to provide more normal blood pressure and perfusion to the brain. Another important question is how giraffes avoid pooling of blood and tissue fluid (edema) in dependent tissue of the extremities. As monitored by radiotelemetry, the blood and tissue fluid pressures that govern transcapillary exchange vary greatly with exercise. These pressures, combined with a tight skin layer, move fluid upward against gravity. Other mechanisms that prevent edema include precapillary vasoconstriction and low permeability of capillaries to plasma proteins. Other anatomical <b>adaptations</b> in dependent <b>tissues</b> of giraffes represent developmental adjustments to high and variable gravitational forces.

METHODS: The animals (n= 48) were divided into four groups: sedentary (CONTROL group); hypertensive after administration of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester for 7 days (L-NAME Group); trained for 8 weeks through swimming exercises (TRAINED Group);trained and treated with L-NAME during the last week (L-NAME TRAINED Group). All the animals were submitted to the experiment procedures for blood pressure (BP) readings and cardiac morphometric evaluation. RESULTS: In comparison to the other groups, the L-NAME and L-NAME TRAINED groups were hypertensive (p< 0. 05); however, BP elevation in the L-NAME TRAINED group was significantly lower than the L-NAME group (p< 0. 05). The heart weight indexes for the TRAINED and L-NAME TRAINED groups were higher than the CONTROL and L-NAME groups (p< 0. 05). Also they had presented higher rates of macroscopic cardiac area and cardiac fibrosis in relation to the rest (p< 0. 05); comparisons revealed that the values for the L-NAME TRAINED group were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than the others.

The transducing capacity of cells alters physico-chemical properties of tissues, developing a positive feedback commonly {{recognized as the}} form-function relationship. In this study, organ and <b>tissue</b> <b>adaptations</b> were mapped in the bone-tooth complex by identifying and correlating biomolecular expressions to physico-chemical properties in rats from 1. 5 to 15 months. However, future research using hard and soft chow over relevant age groups would decouple the function related effects from aging affects. Progressive curvature in the distal root with increased root resorption was observed using micro X-ray computed tomography. Resorption was correlated to the increased activity of multinucleated osteoclasts on the distal side of the molars until 6 months using tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Interestingly, mononucleated TRAP positive cells within PDL vasculature were observed in older rats. Higher levels of glycosaminoglycans were identified at PDL-bone and PDL-cementum entheses using alcian blue stain. Decreasing biochemical gradients from coronal to apical zones, specifically biomolecules that can induce osteogenic (biglycan) and fibrogenic (fibromodulin, decorin) phenotypes, and PDL-specific negative regulator of mineralization (asporin) were observed using immunohistochemistry. Heterogeneous distribution of Ca and P in alveolar bone, and relatively lower contents at the entheses, were observed using energy dispersive X-ray analysis. No correlation between age and microhardness of alveolar bone (0. 7 ± 0. 1 to 0. 9 ± 0. 2 GPa) and cementum (0. 6 ± 0. 1 to 0. 8 ± 0. 3 GPa) was observed using a microindenter.

40|$|AIM: To {{validate}} the 'platform switching' concept at oral implants {{with respect to}} the preservation of the alveolar crestal bone levels in an animal model. MATERIAL and METHODS: Five minipigs received three implants each with a 0. 25 mm implant/abutment mismatch and were placed flush (T(0)), 1 mm below (T(1)) and 1 mm above (T(+ 1)) the alveolar bony crest, and as a control, one conventionally restored implant placed at the bone level. The implants were randomly inserted flapless into the mandible. Four months after implant insertion, the animals were sacrificed, and undecalcified block sections were obtained and used for histological analyses. RESULTS: The mean values for peri-implant bone resorption were 1. 09 +/- 0. 59 mm (Control), 0. 51 (+/- 0. 27 mm, T(0)), 0. 50 (+/- 0. 46 mm, T(+ 1)) and 1. 30 (+/- 0. 21 mm, T(- 1)), respectively. Statistically significant differences (P< 0. 05) were found among the test (T(0), T(- 1)) and the control sites. Control implants presented an average biologic width length of 3. 20 mm (+/- 0. 33), with a connective <b>tissue</b> <b>adaptation</b> compartment of 1. 29 mm (+/- 0. 53) and an epithelial attachment of 1. 91 mm (+/- 0. 71). T(0), T(+ 1) and T(- 1) implants presented with a mean biologic width of 1. 97 mm (+/- 1. 20), 2. 70 mm (+/- 1. 36) and 2. 84 mm (+/- 0. 90), respectively, with a connective <b>tissue</b> <b>adaptation</b> compartment of 1. 21 mm (+/- 0. 97), 1. 21 mm (+/- 0. 65) and 1. 50 mm (+/- 0. 70) and an epithelial attachment of 0. 84 mm (+/- 0. 93), 1. 66 mm (+/- 0. 88) and 1. 35 mm (+/- 0. 44), respectively. Differences between the configurations were mainly associated with the length of the epithelial attachment. The epithelial attachment was significantly longer in the C sites than in T(0) (P= 0. 014). However, no other differences between configurations were detected. CONCLUSION: If the implants are positioned {{at the level of the}} alveolar bony crest, the platform-switching concept may have a minor impact on the length of the epithelial attachment (0. 84 vs. 1. 91 mm), while the connective <b>tissue</b> <b>adaptation</b> compartment remains relatively unaffected.

Using flow cytometry, both RAVP 2 and RVVP 2 were demonstrated to bind with Vero cells while these bindings were blocked by D 78 viral particles, implying both very virulent IBDVs (vvIBDVs) and attenuated IBDVs bind to Vero cells through the same receptor(s).

Analysis of 16 S rRNA characters also recovered these relationships providing conversions between A and T were down-weighted. Analysis of the combined data sets gave relatively strong support for various relationships, suggesting that both data sets supported similar topographies.

Although current models are numerically well defined and are able to resemble the <b>tissue</b> differentiation and <b>adaptation</b> processes, they are limited by (1) {{the fact that some of}} their input parameters are likely to be site- and species-dependent, and (2) their verification is done by data that may make the model results redundant. However, some theories do have predictive power despite the limitations of generalization. It seems to be a matter of time until new experiments and models appear with predictive power and where rigorous verification can be performed.
