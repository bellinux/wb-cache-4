The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilhão Dramático de Cascais, their first concert without make-up since early 1973. Lick It Up became Kiss' first gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent's replacement was St. John, a session player and guitar tutor.|$|E

500|$|The {{unexpected}} {{defeat of}} the Liberals was ascribed to various causes. The Ottawa Citizen stated that the defeat {{could be attributed to}} [...] "the uneasy talk... that the Liberals have been in too long." [...] Tom Kent of the Winnipeg Free Press, a future Liberal deputy minister, wrote that though the Liberal record had been the best in the democratic world, the party had failed miserably to explain it. Author and political scientist H.S. Ferns disagreed with Kent, stating that Kent's view reflected the Liberal [...] "assumption that 'Nobody's going to shoot Santa Claus and that Canadians in the 1957 election were motivated by things other than material interests. Peter Regenstreif cited the Progressive Conservative strategy in the 1957 and 1958 elections [...] "as classics of ingenuity unequalled in Canadian political history. Much of the credit belongs to Diefenbaker himself; at least some must go to Allister Grosart". A survey taken of those who abandoned the Liberals in 1957 showed that 5.1% did so because of Suez, 38.2% because of the Pipeline Debate, 26.7% because of what they considered an inadequate increase in the old age pension, and 30% because it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

[...] While Hawke admires Keating's economic prowess, he is perplexed by the other man's [...] "un-Australian" [...] interests.

[...] In [...] a rock ballad, vaguely {{in the style of}} Queen, he sings of his desolation before resolving to challenge for the Prime Ministership ("I Remember Kirribilli"). [...] He confronts Hawke with the blue-eyed soul-style [...] "It's Time"; the song refers to the name of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's famous 1970s campaign and uses Keating's fondness for collecting antique clocks as a motif for his belief that it is indeed <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> of leadership.

40|$|Many {{video games}} {{maintain}} {{a list of}} high scores. This paper investigates mathematical questions inspired by lists of high scores. First, we make the distinction between those high scores which were records when they were earned [...] -the highest score attained, and those scores which are merely among the top five, ten, or twenty. We consider Yn, the number of high scores which were formerly records after n games have been played, showing that Yn has a stationary distribution, and deducing the probabilities P(Yn = k), for k ? 1. We next turn to a dynamic analysis and model the changes in Yn using a Markov chain, and use this {{to prove that the}} expectancy of the next change in Yn is infinite. Finally, we turn to a relaxed version of the problem and consider Zn, the number of changes in the list of high scores after n games. Although the expected waiting <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the next record is infinite, the waiting times are only finite when we seek only the next change in the list. Using a generating function analysis, we find <b>a</b> closed form <b>for</b> the expected waiting <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> in Zn...|$|R

2500|$|Needing {{additional}} {{sources of}} finance to fund Birmingham's bid for immediate promotion {{back to the}} Football League First Division, the board approached Clifford Coombs, founder of home credit company S, for a loan. He agreed to put money into the club, but only if he could run it himself. He duly bought out the Morris family, promised to [...] "find all the money I can afford. My heart is in Birmingham City and now my pocket will be as well", became chairman in January 1966, and lured Stan Cullis, manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers in their glory days, out of retirement. Cullis's team played attractive football, and average attendance doubled between 1965–66 and 1967–68. Cullis led Birmingham to the semi-final of the League Cup in 1967, and in the 1967–68 FA Cup, they beat Arsenal and Chelsea in front of crowds in excess of 50,000 at St Andrew's before losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final.

Fourth place in the division in 1967–68 and seventh in 1968–69 preceded a slump towards the bottom of the table, and Coombs decided it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>change.</b> He persuaded Cullis back into retirement in March 1970, and approached top-class managers, including Brian Clough and Peter Taylor and Don Revie, without success, before appointing Freddie Goodwin of Brighton & Hove Albion manager.|$|E

Having recorded their previous two studio albums in Wales the band {{felt it was}} <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> and initially chose Trident Studios in London, but cancelled due to {{the high costs of}} studio time and accommodation. The idea of working in a busy city environment became something they now wished to avoid, and instead sought a remote location. The recording sessions involved the band tweaking the settings of instruments and positioning of microphones. They recorded basic tracks with multiple takes until they captured the best performance. While Lee, Lifeson and Brown began overdubs, Peart began attempting to write another longer song, and after enduring three days of writer's block, [...] "Natural Science" [...] was born. Fin Costello was then brought in to photograph the band in the studio. Cover art director Hugh Syme was also brought in and recorded a piano solo on [...] "Different Strings". Music was composed for [...] "Natural Science", with some parts reused from the discarded [...] "Green Knight". The water sounds {{at the beginning of the}} song were created by splashing oars in the private lake, performed by Brown and studio assistant Kim Bickerdike, and the natural echo outside was used to record various instruments. The rough mixes on the album were complete, and the final mix was completed in two weeks at Trident Studios. [...] Upon the album's completion, Lifeson felt unsure about the record and for a period of time, could not listen to it due to his feeling that it failed to present any fresh ideas. His opinion changed when he first heard the album on the radio after its release, realising he had overreacted.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{appearance}} of a duplicate copy of a gene at a locus linked loosely, if at all, to the locus at which the gene is usually found. If all copies of the gene are subject to non-functionalizing mutations, then two fates are possible: loss of functional copies at the duplicate locus (loss of duplicate expression), or loss of functional copies at the original locus (map change). This paper proposes a simple model to address the probability of map <b>change.</b> the <b>time</b> taken <b>for</b> <b>a</b> map <b>change</b> and/or loss of duplicate expression, and considers where in the spectrum between loss of duplicate expression and map <b>change</b> such <b>a</b> duplicate complex is likely to be found. The findings are: the probability of map change is always half the reciprocal of the population size N, the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> map <b>change</b> to occur is order N log N generations, and that there is <b>a</b> marked tendency <b>for</b> duplicates to remain near equi-frequency with the gene at the original locus <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large portion of that time.
