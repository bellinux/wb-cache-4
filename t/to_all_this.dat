5|$|The {{surrender}} of Candia ended the {{four and a}} half centuries of Venetian rule in Crete, and brought the Ottoman Empire to its temporary territorial zenith. At the same time however, the cost and casualties incurred during this prolonged war contributed greatly to the decline of the Ottoman state during the latter 17th century. On the other hand, Venice had lost its greatest and most prosperous colony, its pre-eminent trading position in the Mediterranean had diminished, and its treasury was exhausted, having spent some 4,253,000 ducats on the defense of Candia alone. <b>To</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> the Dalmatian gains were insufficient compensation. Upon his return to Venice in 1670, Morosini was tried on charges of insubordination and treason, but was acquitted. Fifteen years later, he would lead the Venetian forces in the Morean War, where the Republic attempted, for the last time, to reverse its losses and reestablish itself as one of the major powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. During that war, in 1692, a Venetian fleet attempted to retake Candia, but failed. The last Venetian strongholds off Crete fell in the last Turkish–Venetian War in 1715. Crete would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state. The island continued under Ottoman suzerainty until the Balkan Wars. In their aftermath, the Ottoman Sultan dropped any claim on the island, and on 1 December 1913 it was formally united to Greece.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

In contrast <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> (and due to a variety of factors, including a pre-war policy that strove for a peaceful resolution and an international arms embargo), the central government under Alija Izetbegović and its formal army was relatively unorganized and unprepared. Because of this, the assistance of well-armed groups such as Prazina's private army in the city's defense was welcomed, and their pre-war criminality overlooked in light of their apparent willingness to fight for a united and sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|Alarmed by {{the sudden}} switch in the European Balance of Power the British made a similar {{agreement}} with Prussia at the Westminster Convention.

This would allow Britain and France to continue their colonial skirmishes without formal war being declared in Europe. Frederick the Great had a number of supporters in London, including William Pitt who welcomed the rapprochement between Britain and Prussia. The Dutch Republic, a long-standing ally of Britain, declared its neutrality {{in the wake of the}} Westminster Convention and had no active participation in the coming conflict.|$|E

During filming on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a severe stroke while sitting in director Jules White's chair, waiting to film the last scene of the day. When Curly was called by the assistant director to take the stage, he did not answer. Moe went looking for his brother: he found Curly with his head dropped to his chest. Moe later recalled that his mouth was distorted and {{he was unable to}} speak, only cry. Moe quietly alerted White <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> leading the latter to rework the scene quickly, dividing the action between Moe and Larry while Curly was rushed to the hospital, where Moe joined him after the filming. Curly spent several weeks at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California before returning home for further recuperation.|$|E

500|$|During {{the forties}} and fifties, Shostakovich had close {{relationships}} {{with two of}} his pupils: Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as [...] "tender". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend, Viktor Suslin, said that she had been [...] "deeply disappointed" [...] in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later.|$|E

Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E

[...] Melissa Walters at BlackFilm.com, while believing some of the writing to be clichéd and the story familiar, also called the film [...] "heartfelt, genuine, and enjoyable." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars in his Chicago Sun-Times review, declaring the film [...] "warm" [...] and praising the screenplay's [...] "unforced, genuine affection for its characters." [...] IGN.com gave the film a 4/5 rating, naming Robinson's directorial debut [...] "masterful." [...] Metacritic, a normalized film rating website, provided the film a 63/100 score.
