40|$|This {{investigation}} studied attainment {{in students}} {{with mental health}} difficulties who were taking modules by distance learning with the UK Open University in 2012. Students with mental health difficulties who had no additional disabilities were less likely than nondisabled students to complete the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> taken {{and less likely to}} pass the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> completed. However, <b>they</b> were just as likely as nondisabled students to obtain good grades for the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> passed when the effects of age, gender, prior qualifications, and financial assistance had been taken into account. Students with mental health difficulties who had additional disabilities were less likely than nondisabled students to complete the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> taken, less likely to pass the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> completed, and less likely to obtain good grades for the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> passed...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} studied attainment {{in students}} with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) who were taking modules by distance learning with the UK Open University in 2012. Students with ASDs {{who had no}} additional disabilities were as likely as nondisabled students to complete the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> taken, to pass the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> completed and to obtain good grades for the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> passed. Students with ASDs who had additional disabilities were less likely than nondisabled students to complete the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> taken, but <b>they</b> were as likely as nondisabled students to pass the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> completed and to obtain good grades for the modules <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> passed. Their lower completion rate presumably reflects {{the impact of their}} additional disabilities rather than their ASDs. In distance education, at least, students with ASDs tend to perform on a par with their nondisabled peers...|$|R

5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.|$|E

After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy presentation in Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E
