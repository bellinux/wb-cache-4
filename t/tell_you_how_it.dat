500|$|After the war, Lilly {{remained}} in the South to begin a new business venture. Lilly and his business partner leased a [...] cotton plantation in Mississippi. Lilly traveled to Greencastle, Indiana, and returned with his wife, Emily, his sister, Anna Wesley Lilly, and son, Josiah. Shortly after the move the entire family was stricken with a mosquito-borne disease, probably malaria, that was common in the region at that time. Although the others recovered, Emily died on August 20, 1866, eight months pregnant with a second son, who was stillborn. The death devastated Lilly; {{he wrote to his}} family, [...] "I can hardly <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> glares at me...it's a bitter, bitter truth... Emily is indeed dead." [...] Lilly abandoned the farm and returned to Indiana. The plantation fell into disrepair and a drought caused its cotton crop to fail. Lilly's business partner, unable to maintain the plantation because of the drought, disappeared with the venture's remaining cash. Lilly was forced to file for bankruptcy in 1868.|$|E
